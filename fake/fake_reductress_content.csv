Mental Healthcare Remembered as Another Silly Quarantine Project,1672,"At a recent gathering, friends Tanya, Fred, and Monique recounted the various fun little hobbies and endeavors they tried out during lockdown, including attending to their mental health for the first time in their adult lives.   “I tried telehealth therapy since my job was offering it for free,” Tanya said. “It really was cool talking for a while and working through attachment issues I never realized I had. Then I also tried digital painting and baking sourdough! But now I can go to bars again, so, obviously, that’s all over.”   Others similarly skidded around the seriousness and absolute need for mental healthcare.   “Oh my god, I totally did that too!” said Fred. “I was in my childhood bedroom talking about how depressed I felt for like three months straight! But that got a little too intense after a while so I went straight into jigsaw puzzles and video games to smooth the brain.”   Fred quietly stared off into the distance after he finished speaking. Monique had similarly taken up taking care of her mental health as a silly quarantine project, but for her, this was one of the hobbies that stuck.   “I feel you guys, I have been going to therapy for a while now. It’s been over a year!” Monique said. “I guess this is my permanent quirky little hobby now, lol.”   The other two were puzzled by this.   “Didn’t you want to move on to other hobbies? Did you try watching Love is Blind?” Tanya asked.   “Yes, but I had a lot of time. I did some hiking. But therapy really works for me!” Monique replied.   At press time, the other two were quietly sipping their drinks until Fred insisted unprompted that his intrusive thoughts were “definitely gone now”.","Jun 30, 2021"
I Was Denied Treatment Because Our Healthcare System is Broken and Also My Nurse Was Filming a TikTok,2065,"If one thing is clear, it’s that our country’s healthcare system is a mess. Healthcare costs are rising, insurance options are more complicated than ever, and implicit bias still affects who receives adequate treatment. So it is with incredible frustration that I was denied treatment at a recent doctor’s visit – due to our profoundly broken system, and that my nurse and others were shooting a complex TikTok dance all in one take.   You see, my doctor had asked me to return to her office to have an abscess drained. But when I got there, the nurse was saying something about how my insurance wouldn’t cover the procedure, but I could pay for it out-of-pocket. Also she was dancing in front of the phone at the time.   I tried to ask her why my insurance wouldn’t cover this basic procedure but she just kept shaking her hips and pointing her fingers at imaginary things in the air.   It wasn’t until my friend texted me later, “Is this you in the background with the IV drip?” that I saw what was going on. The nurse had been filming a TikTok to the song “Dance Monkey” by Stripped Back. And in the video she was playfully brushing the hair back from both sides of her face pointing to word bubbles that popped up individually to spell out “check” “your” “coverage” “before” “you” “get” “to” “your” “doctor’s” “office.” Then she put her hands on both hips and posed before moving her head back and forth to make room for more words that popped up on the screen reading, “you” “may” “need” “prior” “authorization” “before” “your” “visit”.   I felt so embarrassed and also my abscess was still throbbing. What is this world where a person can’t receive treatment and also must be mocked on it via an account that somehow has seventy THOUSAND followers?!     I still haven’t been able to sort this issue out with my insurance provider. And nurse Jenny is still racking up views. And I don’t appreciate the part at the end where she sassily raises her eyebrow and nods back at me.   Our collective inability to solve this problem hurts. And my abscess really hurts.","Jan 16, 2020"
How to Heal Yourself With Guns When You Don’t Have Access to Healthcare,2802,"Lately the threat of losing healthcare has been looming over millions of Americans. While access to affordable healthcare may be at risk, guns remain widely accessible to anyone and everyone. Since they’re so bountiful, you may want to try a gun in an emergency rather than resort to our healthcare system for safe and affordable care. Here’s how to heal yourself with guns when you don’t have access to any of that stuff any more.   Apply a gun to the wound. When you’re wounded and can’t afford the massive fees of a hospital visit, simply apply a gun to the wound. If you don’t already own a gun, no worries! Buying a gun costs way less than seeking medical attention and works almost as well. Hold the gun against your wound until bleeding stops or until you receive another gun, in which case you can hold two guns against your wounds instead of one. For severe bleeding, you can fire the gun and press the hot barrel of the gun against your wound to cauterize it. You’ll heal in no time.   Take a bullet like a pill. Take a bullet like a pill if you require life-saving prescription meds but can’t afford them. Bullets come in all shapes and sizes, so you can buy hundreds of bullets and store them in a big bottle to replicate the look and feel of your meds. Though they’re not actual medicine, they’re what you have right now and you can make them work! They’re made of metal and that is strong! Your body should start healing at any moment.   Perform gun-based surgery. If the six-figure cost of an emergency room visit would bankrupt you, but you need immediate surgery to live, perform gun-based surgery – a type of surgical procedure executed with and by a gun. Gun-based surgery is completely free minus the cost of the gun, which you can buy at most Wal-mart for under $100. Ideally, you will perform the surgery with a bayonet or some type of gun with a sharp point, although really any gun will do. This surgery has a 3% survival rate, which is better than the not surgery you have access to without healthcare. Guns can heal you, and that’s why we protect them more than the human right to accessible healthcare!     Become a gun. When all other options fail, become a gun, or at least a half-woman, half-gun cyborg. You can do this simply by turning yourself into a metal tool designed to hurt others, and within minutes legislation should be signed to protect your existence. The only downside is that you will have to live the rest of your life as a weapon rather than a person, but under this administration, that might not be so bad!   If you’ve already lost healthcare or are at risk of losing healthcare, don’t panic! At least you will always have access to guns, so follow these gun-based healing tips to ensure you stay healthy. Sometimes you just have to use what you’ve got!","May 10, 2017"
Trans Patient With Broken Arm Spends Half of ER Intake Answering Questions About Gender Identity,2402,"After a cycling accident last Thursday, Julian Berton spent half of their ER intake answering questions about their trans gender identity while awaiting medical assistance for their badly broken arm.   “I had to mark my birth sex on the intake, which was already difficult because I’m right-handed, and had shattered multiple bones in my right arm,” says Julian. “But it also brought an onslaught of clarifying questions about my gender identity.”   “I think they were actually trying to be sensitive and inclusive,” Julian adds. “But they also seemed deeply confused, plus it was hard to give answers as I gritted my teeth to endure the pain of my smashed and neglected bones.”   Before Julian was able to see a doctor, they first filled a nurse in on everything that was going on with their genitals, hormones, sexuality, and gender identity.   “She read me a list of ten genders she could mark down, and when I said transgender man was fine, she asked me what that was,” Julian says. “I don’t think her intentions were bad, but it was sort of frustrating because my snapped radius had pierced through my skin and I was bleeding a lot on my shirt.”   Once Julian made it through intake, they answered roughly the same set of questions for the ER doctor who was treating them.   “These matters aren’t irrelevant,” says Dr. Kendall Jared. “When [redacted] told me [redacted] was on testosterone, I was concerned. You see, testosterone can be very dangerous if you’re planning to regularly get car doored while biking through the city and snap your arm bones clean in half.”   But Julian doesn’t see it that way.   “My gender and trans healthcare just didn’t seem that relevant to them putting my bones back inside of my body instead of outside of it,” they insist. “At first, when they were asking me all these questions about my preferred name and identity, I guess I thought that meant they were going to respect those things, but that wasn’t the case either, so I’m not sure what it was for.”   In fairness to the medical team, Julian reports the pain of being addressed as “Ms. [redacted]” for the duration of their hospital stay paled in comparison to that of their absolutely fucked to pieces radius and ulna.     “Thankfully I have a cast now,” Julian says. “So I can grab a sharpie and write up some FAQs on it about my trans gender identity for follow-up visits.”   Now that’s good healthcare!","Aug 26, 2021"
Man’s Insurance Plan Only Covers Free Therapy From Girlfriend,1998,"In the United States, good health insurance is hard to come by, but one man found an option that actually works for him. After days of searching for an affordable and reliable therapist, 27-year-old Chicago resident Sam Mulligan discovered that his insurance plan only covers free therapy from his girlfriend Becca Oden.   “It’s so great. Now I don’t have to worry about copays or booking any appointments. I just have to send a vague text about my day and I get a session that same day,” says Sam. “Plus, it’s free!”   Becca gave reporters more insight into their practice.   “Every Friday Sam and I reflect on his week and talk about anything that’s bothering him. This helps us open up a clear line of communication,” Becca says. “My friends and therapist keep telling me that I need to draw a boundary to pay attention to my own feelings but these talks help me feel closer to him. Plus he really couldn’t find anyone he liked in network.”   Sources clarify that Sam was not the one who searched for an affordable and reliable therapist; Becca also provided that service free of charge, and he vetoed all of the options for reasons such as “same age as my mom” or “weird glasses frames”.   “I’m so glad that I have her in my life,” says Sam. “Without her I’d probably be paying an arm and a leg just for a diagnosis. God, our healthcare system is really so messed up. I think I want to talk more about that in our next session.”   “I don’t think it’s healthy,” says Fernanda, a mutual friend. “I get that couples are supposed to help each other through emotional stuff but Sam literally calls Becca at random times throughout the day expecting her to drop everything and console him. Also I don’t think you’re supposed to be having sex with your therapist.”   “I think people are jealous of just how close we are,” Sam explains., “I’ve never felt closer to someone before and I can feel my mental health improving each week.”   Becca confirms her therapy bill has skyrocketed since meeting Sam.","Aug 16, 2021"
"It’s Not Illegal to Get an Abortion, It’s Just Impossible Because of Laws",2929,"While many Americans are distressed by the multi-state ongoing effort to challenge and ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade, analysis shows that the federally protected right to have an abortion is not illegal, it’s just impossible because of, you know, laws.   In this nation, everyone has a right to individual privacy and bodily autonomy, and by extension, women can terminate pre-viabable pregnancies for any reason. Texas signed a new legislation that bans abortion if the heartbeat of the fetus can be heard, which can happen as early as six weeks into pregnancy. But, hey, that doesn’t mean that it’s illegal to get an abortion. You just have a really tight window for abortion. Like, you have to get it before almost anyone would know they were pregnant, so be sure to stay on top of that if you want to have the right that you totally do have.   Alabama signed legislation in 2019 that banned abortion all together, with the punishment of life in prison for doctors who perform one. The good news is, it’s currently unenforceable because it so blatantly violates the constitution. So if you’re in Alabama, rest assured that your right to an abortion has not been taken; your government is just working very hard to take it. But if they do succeed that’s no big deal, because people can just travel to another state! Just probably not Texas because of that heartbeat rule that they have.   People who need to get an abortion should also probably avoid Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia too, because each of them reportedly only have one abortion clinic left in each respective state. One legal inaccessible, insufficient, underfunded clinic.   There are also eighteen states that currently have government-mandated delays before abortion, including Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.   In these states, people are forced to delay their abortions for at least 24 hours while they receive state-mandated anti-abortion information, and in a few states, patients are also required to make two trips to the clinic: one to receive anti-choice information and then another one the next day for their actual abortion. But, again, this emotional warfare and waste of time doesn’t mean abortion is illegal! It’s just so taxing and out of reach that it’s insane to think that this is the reality of this country’s reproductive healthcare system.   So despite popular misbelief, abortions are totally legal, (unless Alabama has anything to say about it — and then if they succeed, the floodgates are open!) And they are totally easy to get as long as you have insurance, live in a state without anti-abortion mandates, and you’re able to schedule an appointment before six weeks of pregnancy! Impossible, but not illegal (due to laws!)  ","Jul 8, 2021"
"Biden Assures Nation He’ll Send $2,000 Stimulus as Soon as His Direct Deposit Hits",2505,"In a relatively unconvincing pledge, a visibly desperate President Biden insisted to the entire population of the United States that he’s “totally good” for the $2,000 stimulus that the Democrats had been promising, but just needs “a couple extra weeks to work out the cash flow situation.”   Biden promised that his reticence to send the relief checks had nothing to do with political will, and everything to do with the fact that he’s been between jobs since January 2017 and just needs a minute to breathe and bulk up his savings account.   “Like, on paper, sure, I make $400,000 a year,” Biden conceded to the general public. “But I don’t get my first paycheck until the 31st, and even that will be prorated because I didn’t work the full two weeks of the pay period. So I can probably get you the money by then, but it would probably be ideal for me to hold off until like mid-Feb, if that’s chill with you.”   Biden also apologized for his general lack of clear communication about the COVID relief package, citing the fact that his “personal life has been all over the place” thus far in 2021.   “I just moved to a new place, started a new gig, witnessed a violent insurrection in protest of my imminent ascent to power,” Biden listed while absentmindedly signing a pile of executive orders. “I’m really sorry for not following up, but I haven’t even replied to all my ‘congratulations on winning the election’ and ‘happy birthday’ emails—you should see my inbox.”   “Shit, speaking of, I gotta tell USPS to reroute my mail,” Biden realized before scribbling a note on his extensive to-do list.   Biden has touted $2,000 stimulus checks as one of many achievements he intends to complete before the end of his first 100 days in office. Other items include delivering the COVID-19 vaccine to 100 million Americans, passing a sweeping infrastructure package, and getting a guy from Spectrum to come down to the White House and reset the Wi-Fi because the outgoing Trump administration never shared the password.   “The country needs to heal, and I intend to work tirelessly to achieve that goal,” Biden declared confidently. “But also, no one’s told me how I can log into the White House Slack channel, and it feels like it’s probably pretty important that I get fully onboarded before I try to go around doing president stuff.”   At press time, Biden announced that expanding Obamacare to include a public option would have to wait until someone from HR gives him admin privileges on healthcare.gov.","Jan 25, 2021"
CDC Recommends People Who Pronounce It ‘Onvelope’ Be Vaccinated Last,2117,"With the Covid-19 vaccine on the horizon, many Americans are wondering where exactly they will fall in terms of the priority of vaccination. Many doubts and uncertainties linger, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have brought some clarity to the issue with their recommendation that people who pronounce it “onvelope” be vaccinated last.   “So much thought has gone into determining who should be first to get the vaccine,” says CDC spokesperson Elena Rabal. “Of course you’ve got your essential workers, your immunocompromised, your super old. But there’s still that nagging question of who should be absolutely dead last, and that’s where we landed on those who insist on calling envelopes ‘onvelopes’.”   “Really if it were up to us, and this is on the record — this is a press conference, so maybe that’s obvious, but I just want to be super clear — we would say people who pronounce it ‘onvelope’ should never get the vaccine,” Rabal adds. “I mean, ‘onvelope’, what is that? Is it Canadian? Are you British? Either way, everyone gets to get it I guess so we say give it to them last.”   While the Center is firm and unequivocal in their stance, some are taking issue with their recommendation.     “This just seems highly arbitrary and astonishingly judgmental,” says a small business owner, Thea Rudolph. “How can you determine someone’s right to potentially life-saving preventative healthcare by the way they pronounce a word?”   She clearly pronounces it ‘onvelope’, but even putting that aside, the CDC claims their reasoning is more complex and thoughtful than this admonishment would suggest.   “We’re not trying to deprive people of the vaccine simply because we think the way they say envelope is weird and annoying and bad,” says Rabal. “That would be absurd. Rather, we’ve made an intuition-based determination that people who say ‘onvelope’ are more likely to have antisocial personalities, so we’re not eager to get them vaccinated and back in the mix in society, for everyone’s sake.”   “It’s not a perfect system,” Rabal adds. “But, you know, this is the United States after all.”","Dec 9, 2020"
CDC Panel of Experts Will Determine Vaccine Priority Based on Results of Beauty Pageant,2539,"In response to optimistic safety data from phase 3 vaccine clinical trials, the CDC is allocating the initial limited batches of vaccines to Americans to whom they deem to be queens of the big beauty pageant happening later this month.   Priority for the Covid-19 vaccine will be based on the results of the infamous personality, intelligence, talent, and swimsuit competition.   Many are debating which target demographics are the most susceptible and should receive the resource-limited vaccine first. However, the CDC has assured the public that they can trust an advisory panel of independent public health experts and pageant host Steve Harvey.   Pfizer and Moderna, the two leading pharmaceutical companies in late-stage clinical trials, have estimated they will have enough vaccines to more than 22.5 million Americans who demonstrate poise, grace, the ability to answer questions, and the figure to look amazing in bikinis.     “We want to make sure that, right away, the vaccine goes to empowered Americans who feel confident and know their self-worth,” shared CDC Director Robert R. Redfield. “There are 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million people living in long-term care facilities where 39% of covid-related deaths have occurred, so truly, may the best girls win.”   Regardless, the CDC can only provide recommendations, as priority groups are state-level decisions. Each state has the right to determine rules of local competitions, including age range, pageant questions, and whether the contestant attire judged will be gowns, bathing suits, or sportswear.   These competitions are typically multi-tiered, as regional competitions feeding into national pageants for the required second dose.   “The problem with women is they get so damn catty!” shared host Steve Harvey about the vaccine scarcity.   Many believe the vaccine should be given to a mix of essential workers, with a focus on Black and Hispanic people, who both represent a majority of this group and, as a whole, have been hurt disproportionately by the pandemic. They are even further disadvantaged by the pressure and out-of-pocket costs to conform to conventionally white beauty standards and being objectified by the very people who let them down throughout this whole pandemic.   When reached for comment, Dr. Redfield encouraged everyone to prepare accordingly and envision themselves on stage, imagining how empowered they would feel to be a Beauty Queen, wear a tiara, and win adaptive immunity to a devastating virus they so rightfully earned.","Dec 2, 2020"
"Pandemic ‘Stigmatizing’, Reports the Pale and Fucked-Up Looking   ",2052,"While the Coronavirus has raised public awareness of systemic inequality in access to healthcare, one disproportionately affected group has gone largely ignored. For the pale and fucked-up looking, fear of COVID-19 has been deeply stigmatizing, sources report.   “Ashen skin, under-eye bags, and general sweatiness is my reality 365 days a year,” says Elle Mitchell. “Now, I’m looked at with fear and disgust. Mothers pull their children away from me on the street. It isn’t right.”   “I’m not sick,” Mitchells adds. “These are just my genes. And maybe also my lifestyle, but not in a way that’s contagious.”   Other generally sickly individuals echo her sentiment.   “The increasingly large scope of maladies that fall under the ‘COVID symptoms’ umbrella has had a really negative impact on me,” says Rhea Murray. “Headache, fatigue, sore muscles? Practically anything that’s wrong with you could be COVID, and there’s always something wrong with me.”   “You know that co-worker who basically has a cold from October to May?” adds Murray. “I am that co-worker. I’m pale, I’m tired, I’m always sniffling, and I’m not going anywhere.”   For all its difficulty, this period of increased adversity has brought members of the community together and led many to find their voice in the empowering protection of company.     “This pandemic is a terrible thing for a number of reasons, at least three or four that I could think of off the top of my head,” says Ronnette Lee. “And we need to do everything we can to stop it, but before we do that, we do need to address its toll on the fucked-up looking population, and we’re ready to demand that.”   “In the past, people would ask me if I was okay at random times, or suggest that I get more sun,” Lee says. “Now they just avoid me altogether. Actually, that part’s sort of better, but in general it’s still not fair.”   Their message to the public is clear: don’t let fear override your ability to see humanity.   “I’m a person with feelings, and I don’t have COVID,” says Mitchell. “I’m just kind of gross.”","Oct 15, 2020"
Annoying White American Thinking About Becoming Annoying White Canadian,2014,"In a move that comes as a surprise to no one, annoying white American Gemma Evans has announced plans to become an annoying white Canadian if “things keep going the way they’re going” in the United States.   “I know everyone says this, but if Trump is reelected, I’m seriously gonna move to Canada,” says Evans. “America has become a laughingstock, I’m honestly ashamed to be from this country.”   While Evans, a cis white woman with intergenerational wealth, is among those least impacted by American oppressive violence, she is meaningfully embarrassed to be associated with it.   “Do you know how racist this country is?” Evans asks. “It’s horrible. Send me to Canada where the people are nice! You never hear about racism in Canada.”   And with the belief that racism doesn’t exist in Canada in mind, Evans has fueled her desire to move from one site of European colonization and genocide of indigenous peoples to the same but with better healthcare.   “I would love to be Canadian,” Evans says. “I finally wouldn’t have to feel embarrassed to say where I’m from when I’m on vacation.”   However, not everyone in Evans’s life is convinced by the validity of her plan.     “When I saw Gemma made a Facebook status asking if she knew any immigration attorneys I just assumed it would have to do with the ongoing human rights crisis at the southern border,” said a Facebook friend, Mel Linden. “But it was actually just a jokey statement about how she’s moving to Canada because of anti-mask protests in the south. And she’s been working from home in the Hamptons since March!”   Another acquaintance put it more bluntly.   “Why the fuck does Gemma get to flee America?” says Annabel Park. “If she’s so concerned about the state of this country, maybe she should dedicate that energy to some political action here.”   But Evans is not dissuaded by her critics. “Healthcare here I come!” she says. “I mean, I actually have pretty good healthcare, but I’m excited to not be from a place where so many people don’t.”","Sep 15, 2020"
Friend Who’s Uncomfortable Talking Politics Totally Cool Discussing How She Got Railed Last Night,2490,"In a developing story out of Chicago, Sarah Anderson told her friend Liza that she’s not comfortable talking politics right now before she launched into an extremely detailed play-by-play of how she absolutely got railed last night by some guy named Brady.   “I know Biden has some plan about healthcare or whatever but that stuff just makes me feel, like, so uneasy,” explained Anderson. “Can we keep the convo to something more light like the weather or how Brady totally plowed me in the kitchen at four in the afternoon on Saturday?”   “And then again that night against my Ikea nightstand. Totally broke it. But that’s probably the bad craftsmanship, I should’ve paid for someone to put it together instead of doing it myself!” Anderson added.   She went on for another 15 minutes, sparing no detail of their intricate two hours of foreplay involving various toys, food, and her pasta colander.   “Brad and I got hella kinky, we were watching TV and then we just went at it on the couch,” said Anderson. “I did mute the TV though because there was some stuff about protests downtown against the police or something and that was bumming me out but I don’t wanna get into that.”   Anderson trailed off, her eyes falling to the floor before she quickly switched the topic back to how Brad and her even tried the “grapefruiting” trick Tiffany Haddish did in the 2017 blockbuster hit Girls Trip.   Anderson, who forgot to vote in the previous three elections and wears a “The future is female” button on her jean jacket, says that she just prefers keeping things “chill” and wishes everyone would stick to more agreeable topics like the latest episode of The Bachelor or the 15-paragraph sexts she currently has going with Brad.   “It’s 2020, of course I’m a feminist,” said Anderson. “I love Lizzo, I don’t wear makeup, I went to the Women’s March. I also got the shit railed out of me last night and boy was that amazing. I’d love to tell you more about it over drinks!”   “But, you know, politics just makes things awkward and intense,” she added. “What am I supposed to do about it? Read articles? No thanks. I’d rather read the extremely detailed texts Brad sends me during work about how he wants to plow me like a farmer on a hot Wisconsin day.”     Sarah is now planning to use her lunch break at work to tell Liza about the girth of Brad’s gorilla cock, but she did just tweet “Pizza over patriarchy!” while sipping from a mug with “Girl Boss” written on it in a pink cursive font.","Aug 24, 2020"
Wow! These Politicians Are Dunking On Republicans Instead of Proposing Substantive Reform   ,2499,"Political analysts have recently identified an intriguing new strategy among Democratic politicians: using their massive platforms to dunk on their Republican opponents, rather than propose any kind of substantive policy reform.   Talk about using your power for good…dunks!   Established Dems like Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary Clinton have embraced such strategies as “clapping back,” subtweeting the President of the United States, claiming to not be surprised by horrifying decisions that will ruin people’s lives, ending vague, obvious statements with the word “period,” and writing “we’re better than this” without specifying how or why.   Mitch McConnell is absolutely shaking in his boots – we’re sure of it!   “One new tactic we’re really excited about is ironically criticizing the Republican establishment’s handling of the COVID-19 response,” explained a liberal campaign strategist who wished to remain anonymous. “No, we are not currently planning to elaborate how we would have handled it differently. Why do you ask?”   Experts believe that these increasingly frequent dunks are an attempt to capture the energy of popular and youth-friendly candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. However, college students we spoke to maintained that AOC’s statements resonated less because they were sick burns, and more because they contained clear and popular plans that had the potential to directly improve their lives.   “It seems like making fun of someone’s weight, even if it is Donald Trump’s, might not be the best way to retain the moral high ground,” said one 20-year-old, pre-med student, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent CNN interview. “But I guess I have to vote for Joe Biden no matter what. Yay.”   Keep that momentum going, folks!   Research shows that the established Democrats’ current approach polls well with constituents who will vote a straight Democratic ticket no matter what, people who post seven political cartoons on Facebook a day, and…no one else. 2020, here we come!   But those worried about the upcoming elections should rest easy. The Democrats aren’t all talk; they have plenty of legislature up their tricky little sleeves. While many constituents are currently hoping for an overhaul of the police system, healthcare reforms, and aggressive climate change policies, the Democrats in the House are rumored to be unveiling a “Haha the CLOWN in the White House sure has weird hair lol” bill within the next few weeks.","Jun 22, 2020"
"Still No Vaccine, But You Are Allowed to Engage in Riskier Behavior",1867,"Proving once and for all that life is all about tradeoffs, there’s still no vaccine for the novel coronavirus, but you are allowed to engage in riskier behavior.   “I definitely wish there was a vaccine,” says New York resident Riley Stewart. “But at least now I can see friends and go out for drinks and stuff. It’s a lot better than being stuck inside my apartment.”   “Why did we even do that?” Stewart adds.   Why did cities across the nation partake in a difficult but collectively minded initiative to curb the spread of coronavirus only to then reopen at the cost of countless human lives? We can’t say for sure, but it’s certainly nice to see the sidewalks crowded with people eating brunch out of plastic takeout containers like New Orleans but with $20 eggs and somehow worse public safety hazards.   “I’m glad things are going back to normal,” says Stewart. “I missed hanging with my buddies, which I was still doing before, but now I don’t have to feel all weird about it.”   But not everyone shares Stewart’s enthusiasm for the new coronavirus non-solution.   “I guess I thought that the point of the lockdown was to stop spreading the disease while the government figured out concrete ways we could deal with it going forward,” says Chicago resident Bree Lennox. “But now it just seems like we’re giving up on that, and all the while we continue to find out more terrifying information about Covid from healthcare workers and people who have had it.”   “I feel pretty confused and scared,” adds Lennox.     Well confused and scared may be the name of the game, but at least now we’re all free to do things that will make the situation worse.   “A couple months ago it felt like we were all making sacrifices to protect each other, especially our most vulnerable populations,” says Lennox. “And I just don’t know why that stopped.”   The answer is money!","Jun 18, 2020"
White Privileges You Could Go Enjoy Instead of Making Yourself the Center of the Racial Justice Movement,2083,"Social justice is trending, and you wanna be a part of it! Since you’ve done little research or reading on how to help, you’ll probably go with your first instinct – dramatic, attention-grabbing behavior that doesn’t help and actually steals focus from the important work others are doing. But before you go Instagraming yourself standing in front of the shattered glass window of an Asian-owned nail salon with a crow bar in hand, ask yourself if you shouldn’t just leave yourself out of this and go enjoy one of the many white privileges you don’t seem to recognize:   Drive Down a Street without Worrying if You’ll be Pulled Over for No Reason Before you run down to what was a peaceful protest and start throwing things at the cops, ask yourself if you might rather take a nice relaxing drive to literally anywhere, where you won’t be harassed by the police or fear for your safety. Do you understand what this is about? Not entirely? Then go for a drive and think about it.   Make Purchases Without Being Questioned Before you try to start a “kill cops” chant in the middle of an info session on how to record police officers in your neighborhood, think about how easily you could go shop for snacks and wine right now. Wanna get out of here and go do that? Because you could do so without getting followed around the store or disbelieved that your credit card is yours. Do you see how this is not about you?     Go Enjoy Anything in Your Statistically Better Life If the only way you know how to show up is by photographing yourself lighting a flag on fire, if you can’t donate actual money or protest or volunteer at a voter registration drive or do anything useful, maybe you should just go enjoy your white life, which probably includes a greater degree of access to proper healthcare, generational wealth, representation in media and government, and the many other freedoms and autonomies you take for granted?   If you can’t help dismantle a racist system without making it about you, ask yourself if you wouldn’t rather enjoy a mask-less margarita on the beach right now.","Jun 4, 2020"
5 Simple Ways To Make The Devastating Global Pandemic About You Missing Your Birthday,2532,"The coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe is nothing short of horrendous.

But nothing of the devastation the world is experiencing even comes close to the fact that your special day is coming up and you don’t even get to party for it! So here are some simple ways to make the global COVID-19 pandemic about missing your birthday.   Be as public as possible about it. When it comes to making sure people know that it’s not just time to celebrate healthcare workers, it’s also time to celebrate you, you need to make sure your voice is the loudest. Tell everyone you see. Grocery clerks, UPS guys, even strangers you pass from six feet away!   If you’re in a major metropolitan area, leave. Stuck in NYC or Chicago or LA? Get out of there! You already have enough to deal with when it comes to getting missed birthday attention, you don’t want a population of millions terrified of contracting a deadly virus to distract from that! Head to your parents house or something. Just make sure you’re quiet about it!   Don’t read the news. Make sure to avoid any and all news outlets. Sure, it’s probably good to have some semblance of what’s going on in the world coronavirus-wise, but then you’ll have to recognize all the people who are sick and dying instead of focusing on yourself and your special day. That’s not fair, birthday girl!   Post about it on all your socials. People have been posting lots of tributes and links to charities and direct action campaigns to provide support for those affected by COVID-19. Well, break up all that negativity! Post as much as you can about how it’s so sad that you won’t get to go to Benihana this year for your not-even-a-milestone birthday. The people need some hope!     Take pictures of the party you throw yourself. Okay so, just because your boyfriend went out of his way to buy you that cake you like and your sous chef roommate is making you your favorite dinner and your parents sent you a new iPhone and you’re having a legitimate albeit small party with the people who you live with doesn’t mean that you can’t post pictures of it with the tags #missedbday, #birthdayinquarantine, or even #thisfuckingsucks! Go all out with the pity party while people are suffering and dying, sis. That’s your right!   Try any of these simple techniques when you wanna make an international disease crisis more focused on you and the fact that you were born. Good luck!","May 20, 2020"
DUDE CORNER: I’m Standing In Solidarity With Nurses By Not Using Protection,2465,"What’s up, coronadudes and coronadudettes? It’s me again, the only writer on this site with balls (metaphorical balls haha!!! I’m smart). And boy, do I have a lot to say. It’s come to my attention that our nation’s healthcare workers are being neglected. During a global pandemic, medical workers are not being provided with the PPE (which sounds like a sex thing but really just stands for personal protective equipment) they they need to stay safe and healthy. And to me, that’s pretty wack. That’s why I’ve decided to take a stand: in solidarity with our brave nurses, I will not be using protection myself, either.   I mean, let’s get real, it’s not like I’m getting laid right now. I’ve been isolating at home with my two roommates Sean and Shawn and our iguana Delilah (#quaranteam). But if I was banging on a regular basis, which is what I do when things are normal, I would absolutely be going raw dog. Why should I, a regular ol’ guy, be able to protect myself from disease when our country’s heroes aren’t being given the tools to do so? I support our troops!     I guess I should get real about something else too: I wasn’t ever really wearing protection to begin with. Wearing a condom is like staying indoors for two months with a molting iguana and two roomies with the same name, one who doesn’t really shower that much: not that fun and a kinda smelly.   Why take the risk, you ask? Well first off, I’ve never met any girl who doesn’t have and IED or whatever they’re called. I haven’t asked specifically, but I feel okay in assuming. Secondly, I’m not afraid of getting a disease. I mean, at least not a sexually transmitted one. That would make for a funny story. I am super afraid of getting corona, which is why I’m so serious about sticking up for the medical staff who are working so hard to fight it.   I heard chlamydia isn’t even that bad, though.   When it comes down to it, I’ve always been the type of guy to stand up for what is right. I found a LiveStrong bracelet at a dorm party one time and wore it for the rest of the semester. I believe in LGBTQ rights, even though I thought Brokeback Mountain was kind of gross. I even used a Black Lives Matter hashtag once to impress a girl. That’s why I absolutely refuse to compromise my morals by using any kind of protection for myself until courageous warriors at the front line of the COVID-19 epidemic are provided with some.   And probably not afterwards either, if we’re being honest.","Apr 22, 2020"
I Support Essential Workers by Aggressively Liking Videos of Them Dancing,1444,"We all know, it’s hard out there for essential workers right now. They’re putting in long hours to meet the needs of the rest of us, while potentially exposing themselves to the virus on a daily basis. That’s why I do my best to support them by doggedly hitting ‘like’ on any and all videos of these people dancing.   Yes, even the kind of mediocre ones.   Whether it’s nurses dancing to Megan Thee Stallion on TikTok, EMTs dabbing, or grocery store employees doing the Macarena, I will like, love, and sometimes even comment with hearts and rainbows to let them know that their efforts matter.   Some would argue it’s not healthcare workers who should be cheering us up right now, and to that I’ll say, “Well, I am liking the videos, so…”   I don’t really know what else I could do to support our heroes on the front lines.     So yes, I’m proud of myself for aggressively hitting ‘like’ whenever I see essential workers dancing or making other viral content. Right now, I consider it my essential job.   Trust that I’m not liking the stories about how they’re putting themselves at risk or don’t have proper PPE, and are dying at higher rates than the rest of us.   I’m glad I can do what little I can, by staying home and watching TV, and occasionally liking these dancing videos on social media.   Even if the dancing is not that great and the dancers aren’t syncing up with each other, I’ll still like it. That’s how far I’m willing to go.","Apr 20, 2020"
"Every Night, This Town Thanks a Doctor by Fucking Her Brains Out",2148,"Every day, healthcare workers risk their lives on the frontlines of this pandemic in order to save others. It may never be possible to give them adequate thanks, but one Washington State town is trying its very hardest. Every night at 7p.m., this town comes together and thanks a doctor by fucking her brains out.   “It’s just a little thing we can all do to show support,” says townsperson Bri Raddler. “And it strengthens our sense of community.”   “It’s so easy to feel isolated when you’re stuck home all day,” Raddler adds. “But when I head outside at seven and see my neighbors taking a local doctor to Poundtown, it’s like, right, we’re all in this together.”   And the local residents aren’t the only ones whose morale has been boosted by this show of solidarity and support.   “It’s been one of the only things keeping me going,” says Emergency Room physician Dr. Ophelia Chen. “As a health care provider, this pandemic is the worst thing I can imagine working through, but knowing that if I’m off by seven, I get the chance to have passionate, carnal love made to me by every consenting adult in town is enough to make it through the day.”   “Of course, I’m typically extremely exhausted by the time I finish my shift, but the town has been great about letting me just lie there,” Dr. Chen adds. “I’m lucky to have such a supportive group of townspeople slamming my damn bones on the regular.”   Naturally, the town’s somewhat unorthodox practice has raised concerns with its potential to further the spread of the virus.   “It is the recommendation of the state to not have sex with people you don’t live with,” says Mayor Sam Livitz. “And to have raging group sex with any number of strangers would be even more discouraged.”     “However, much in the way some local leaders are concerned by the cost to the economy of shelter-in-place orders, I am concerned by the idea of the town not plowing the living heck out of a medical hero each night, and I know I have my constituents support on that position,” the Mayor adds.   “At this time, we are asking all residents to do their part by making their own masks and condoms.”   Stay safe!","Apr 8, 2020"
It’s Crucial That We as a Nation Not Let This Pandemic Stop Us From Giving Me Attention   ,2366,"Let’s face it: We are facing an unprecedented time in our society’s history, and we have to just…live through it. It’s incredibly difficult, even for the most confident and stable among us. But we must stay strong, for ourselves and for those around us. And the best way to do that is to maintain some sense of normalcy. That’s why it is crucial that we, as a nation, don’t let this pandemic stop us from giving me attention specifically.   It’s easy to let a situation like this get you down. With no beautiful days out in the park, no happy hours with friends ­–­ not even a group study session ­– the disconnect from human contact is enough to drive anyone crazy. That’s why it’s so important to find alternate ways of connecting with the outside world. Especially if one of your loved ones is me because I still desperately need the same attention I was getting pre-coronavirus, and now more than ever, I really need us all to come together and provide that to me.   I will not survive if people are not perceiving and validating me on a near-constant basis. I don’t think I’m asking for too much.   Of course, there are plenty of people on the frontlines of this pandemic who also need our support more than ever. Healthcare specialists, grocery store clerks, and sanitation workers are just a small sampling of the essential employees who are forced to do their jobs despite the deadly virus spreading with abandon. Don’t get me wrong, we need to rally around them. It’s just that we should all make sure to save a little bit of energy to also rally around me as soon as you’re done doing that. Even just, like, a quick fave on my Instagram post or a retweet is fine, I just need to be acknowledged by everyone all of the time, pandemic time included. It can even be slightly less than before, obviously, I’m not selfish.   But not that much less. I still need all the attention I can get. I just posted a selfie if anyone wants to check it out.   I think that living through this madness will teach us all a little bit about community. The way we have universally stepped up to help our neighbors is a testament to how great we can be when we come together for a unifying cause. And hopefully, we can all remember that one of the most crucial causes that we should be unifying for is giving me, specifically, attention. It’s the least we, as a nation, can do!","Apr 6, 2020"
How to Cum Hard Enough to Envision the End of Capitalism,2286,"Sometimes, when you’re looking for the Big O, thinking about the various crises conferred on the world by too-big-to-fail financial institutions can really take the wind out of your sails. Fortunately, we’ve got some tips for you to cum so hard, you’re able to conceive of a future without capitalism. Here’s how:   Use Your Breath Concentrate on mixing up your breathing. Alternate between long and short breaths. Need a trick to induce shortness of breath? Imagine the student loan debt you’re suffocating under every single day.   Introduce a Vibrator Speaking of, doesn’t a mechanical penis prove that any job can be automated? I mean, like, what’s to say we all couldn’t lose our jobs tomorrow? Where are the social safety nets that should undergird a society that leaves things in such a precarious state?   Act Out a Fantasy Let your imagination run wild! Pretend you’re Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the IMF, and your partner is Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve. Together, the two of you channel your influence to abolish currency – all while pounding the everloving fuck out of each other.     Talk Theory to Me Stock up on those Verso books! Sometimes, softly whispering Judith Butler into your partner’s ear is exactly what the doctor ordered. But don’t stop there: Describe the left’s new vision of public transport as a means to rebuild the social fabric. Steamy!   Switch Positions We all have our favorite ways of getting down, but why not try switching things up? Are you a Trotskyist? Try seeing things from the Maoist perspective. Are you a Leninist? Let down your guard, and embrace some free-wheeling experimentation with Anarchism.   Think About Sweden Yes, it seems like a no-brainer, but thinking about the Nordic model can really hurry things along. While he’s thinking about baseball, you can fantasize about universal healthcare and free tertiary education.   Following just a few of these tips can be the difference between a run-of-the-mill orgasm and an earthquake of pleasure that enables you to imagine a future where Jeff Bezos doesn’t make more in one week than your entire lineage makes over the course of all of recorded history. But if none of these tips work, you can always do kegels while calling your reps! Try it!","Mar 31, 2020"
I Went As A Nurse For Halloween in Third Grade – Here’s What You Need To Know About Coronavirus,2306,"In these frightening times, it’s so important to not fall prey or even participate in the spread of misinformation. However, now’s not the time to stick your head in the sand. The only way to combat misinformation is to be equipped with good information, and that’s what I’m here to provide. As someone who went as a nurse for Halloween in third grade, here’s what you need to know about coronavirus.   You can get it from surfaces – or can you? As an individual who not only dressed up as a nurse at age 8, but also sort of wanted to be one for a while in middle school, I can say with confidence that my friend told me Coronavirus can live on surfaces. The good news is, my friend (who’s actually more of a Facebook friend who I can’t remember how I know but maybe summer camp? Did I go to camp? I don’t know) said that the virus only stays on surfaces for the length of an HBO dramedy, but you can reduce this time by breathing on the surface and then rubbing it down like a pair of glasses. Make sure you wear gloves! Fingerless, if you want to look cool while fighting disease. Pretty sure I’m getting this right.   You can test for if you have it at home. Everyone freaking out about inaccessibility to testing kits is a manufactured panic the government has created to control the population or something like that. It has to do with the election, but look, I went as a nurse for Halloween, not a political scientist. Either way, there’s no cause for concern, because you can test whether or not you have the virus in the comfort of your own home. Just close your eyes, and say the alphabet backward. If you have the brainpower to accomplish this, then you are not infected. This works for people of all ages.     Remember to appreciate healthcare professionals. Among those most at risk are the healthcare professionals gambling everything to help keep everyone else healthy. Take a moment to appreciate them. For instance, I am sacrificing time I could be doing the cinnamon challenge (one known Coronavirus cure) because I care more about getting life-saving information to everyone else. I guess that’s just me.   So stay safe, stay inside a thick sleeping bag (COVID can only travel through 2 inches of fabric), and wash your hands with water icy cold enough to freeze bacteria. You’re welcome.","Mar 18, 2020"
"Now That I’m the Happiest and Most Stable I’ve Ever Been, It’s Time to See a Therapist",1534,"Well, the day has finally arrived! My life has finally reached a point of stability where I have the resources to see a therapist.   In the past, there were many hurdles to me finding a therapist – cost, long work hours, inadequate health insurance, and the mental health issues that made navigating the mental healthcare system nearly impossible. But now that I’ve resolved my anxiety, depression, and other mysterious undiagnosed issues on my own and overcome the systemic barriers that kept my life in a state of uncertainty, I can finally set aside the time, money, and mental resources to procure a therapist.   I knew this day would finally come!     Now, I look forward to sitting with a therapist and rehashing some of the insecurities, childhood traumas, and general chemical imbalances that wreaked havoc on my teen years, my twenties, and much of my 30s as I struggled to maintain healthy relationships and my career, but in a way less angsty, raw, and unprocessed way. Good or bad, I’ve already constructed my own narrative about it all, and I can’t wait to tell my therapist all about it.   And now that I’ve found ways to cope and process entirely on my own to the point where I’ve found happiness and stability, it really should be pretty easy to go to therapy.   I’m so glad I got here!   And I just want anyone reading to know that there is hope – someday you will if you’re lucky enough, you just might find yourself in the position of being a grounded, positive person, who is now able to pursue therapy. Good luck!","Mar 10, 2020"
The Best Online Therapy Apps Your Family Will Tell You Are for White Folks,2869,"With new online counseling and therapy apps being released every day, taking charge of your own mental health has never been easier – for your black parents to dismiss as a thing for white people. Your black mom and dad agree that being able to reflect on past trauma from the comfort of home is very nice, but only for your white friend, Heather. With thousands of trained professionals at your fingertips, it’s easy to get overwhelmed, especially when your parents chuckle about the frivolity of mental healthcare. So, here are five well-reviewed therapy apps your parents will tell you are for white folks:   Better Help This therapy app eliminates the negative stigma associated with physically entering a therapist’s office but it will not eliminate your black parent’s belief that paying a stranger to know your secrets is a white pastime. Better Help completely protects user anonymity thru nicknames, which is a crucial feature for somebody else’s child.   Breakthrough The therapists on the Breakthrough app are backed by hundreds of positive reviews, hours of academic training, and years of professional experience your black family will ignore because “No one in the entire history of this family has ever needed a shrink before. Not even the slaves,” says Black Dad.     7 Cups of Tea The 7 Cups of Tea app allows you to speak openly with peer volunteers about your problems completely free of charge, which isn’t even professional therapy, but is still somehow embarrassing for the entire black community. “You don’t need to download some app to talk to your friends about what really matters: The Bears, which boots are good for yard work, and the hit series, “Power” only on Starz,” confides Black Dad.   Regain Regain is for couples trying to build stronger happier relationships and for “filthy pervert freaks trying to hear your bedroom business!” claim Black Parents in unison, the closest they’ve been in years. “If you want to talk to someone about your problems, speak to the one true counselor, our Father who art in Heaven,” suggests Black Mom.   Talkspace With Talkspace, there’s no more waiting weeks between appointments! Your therapist is available to chat 5 days a week about all of the emotions you have to pretend don’t exist. “You see sweetie, sadness is something our people hold tightly inside and carry quietly everywhere we go allowing it to slowly whittle away at our spirit and joy,” explains Black Mom. And it’s also apparently something white people can text about at no additional cost.   If you’re white and interested in improving your mental health on the go or even from the comfort of your own bed, give any of these apps a try! If you’re black, or a second-generation immigrant, or any minority really, these are the very best online therapy apps for your finger to hover over a few times a week for the next three years!","Dec 8, 2019"
"I Support Medicare For All Except Brendan, May He Perish In Haste",3018,"It’s so important to be aware of the issues that are being fought for in the political sphere. To me, the most crucial right that we’re battling for is healthcare. And that’s why I’ll only vote for a candidate whose platform includes providing healthcare to everyone, regardless of income. Because I fully, 100% support Medicare for all, with the single exception of my ex-boyfriend Brendan, who I hope perishes in haste.   You see, the US is one of the only remaining wealthy, western countries that doesn’t offer universal healthcare as a rule. I think that’s it’s frankly embarrassing to be so far behind on an issue that other developed nations have been on board with for decades. The fact that so many of our citizens cannot see a doctor or afford their medication is a national disgrace. We need government-mandated Medicare for every single person who lives in this country. Unless that person happens to be one Brendan Lackey-Overheart, a piss-poor excuse for a man. He can drop dead from an STD run rampant for all I care.   It’s simply not acceptable for a country to not provide for its citizens, especially a country like ours that has all the resources it could ever need. Countless numbers of people have suffered and even died due to lack of routine doctor’s visits or the cost of insulin or a dearth of prenatal care. And while my piece of shit ex Brendan does have asthma which does require the use of an albuterol inhaler that his insurance doesn’t cover fully, that’s not necessarily who I’m referring to when I say that we need Medicare for everyone. I’m talking everyone but him, you know? Like your grandma and your neighbors and literally every person who lives and breathes in this country, except Brendan’s sorry bitch ass. Let him suffer and die; he deserves it.   I have friends that live abroad who are nervous to come to the US for lots of reasons, but the main one is that they’re concerned about needing medical care and being stuck with a huge bill. To be the one rich country that can’t guarantee that people can get hurt or sick without having to declare bankruptcy? That is humiliating and that is why I support Medicare for all, universally, just not for Brendan. His family can have it, sure, they were super nice to me. Even the girl he cheated on me with for a year and a half deserves to be unburdened by a surprise medical emergency. Not stupid ass dumb ass punk ass Brendan, though. I can’t think of anyone walking the planet who doesn’t deserve universal healthcare except for him. In fact, if God could expedite his death, that’d be great for me and for the world.     Look, my politics are open to interpretation. I’m always happy to change my mind about an issue if presented with new information. But one thing I feel totally, infallibly solid about is that I 100% support Medicare for all, exclusive of Brendan, who I personally feel should be burned slowly before he is drowned quickly. What a waste of life he is, and what a waste of universal healthcare he would be.","Nov 17, 2019"
Here’s The Feminist Reason I’m Not Giving My Boyfriend a Kidney    ,2239,"In our society, men are accustomed to getting what they want, and this sense of entitlement is only fueled when women give in to the demands of Giving Tree Patriarchy, exhausting all their resources in the process. That’s why, as much as I would theoretically like to, I am choosing not to give my diabetic boyfriend a kidney.     Now you may be tempted to condemn me and label me as “selfish”, but for marginalized groups, a degree of “selfishness” can be an act of resistance. The same people who would encourage me to give boyfriend going through renal failure a kidney are those who would force a woman to carry a life-threatening pregnancy to term. My thing is the same as that.   “Would you have me die just to protect the life of some man?” is what I said to at the hospital when we found out I was a perfect match, to which the doctor replied, “This operation has a 99.7% survival rate,” and my boyfriend replied, “Some man?”   Do you know how inequitable our healthcare system is in its treatment of women? Seriously, do you? Because I don’t really know the specifics but I’ve read some headlines that suggest serious systemic issues.   When I weigh whether or not to give my dying boyfriend one of my precious kidneys, I have to make room for my own self-care, which is actually a term that originates from Black Americans learning how to medically care for one another within their community because white healthcare providers would not treat them, but also applies to me individually.   To abate misunderstanding, my refusal to give my partner an operational kidney does not stem from a place of personal fear, nor is it because I just don’t really want to. Rather, it is a matter of principle.   After all, I only have one spare kidney to give. What if I give my boyfriend a kidney, and then a woman of color needs a kidney and I can’t give one to her? It’s unlikely since my best friend is my white sister and she’s in perfect health, but what if I become best friends with a cool woman of color and she needs one? She would be indebted to me forever!   So you see, not giving my boyfriend a kidney is a feminist issue, and it’s a hill upon which I must die, though of course not literally because I have two healthy kidneys.","Nov 11, 2019"
Incredible! Everything This Woman Has Accomplished Was to Spite That One Bitch From 9th Grade,2518,"In a true demonstration of the power of grudge-holding, 32-year-old Dr. Claudia Klein has channeled her desire to get back at a bitchy high school classmate into a successful medical career.   “In 9th grade, Teresa Watkins and I had bio together,” said Dr. Klein. “We were dissecting a frog and I told her I wanted to be a surgeon, and she was like, ‘You know med school is really hard, right? It’s not like Grey’s Anatomy.’”   “This was hideously offensive because Grey’s Anatomy, in fact, was the reason I was mildly interested in being a surgeon,” Dr. Klein continued. “But as soon as she said that, all my other dreams faded away and I knew for certain that I was going into medicine, and I would be an amazing surgeon, all to spite that bitch, Teresa.”   From that day on, Dr. Klein prioritized her studies and excelled at science and math. She went on to pursue a pre-med track at her top choice university, and later attended medical school where she graduated in the top 10% of her class.   “There are only a few types of people in med school,” Dr. Klein said. “You have scientifically minded people who are all about research and discovery. Then you have the type who really wants to help people, and make a difference in individuals’ lives. Then you have me, who just wants Teresa Watkins to know that she was seriously stupid for ever doubting me and I am very successful now so fucking take that.”   Dr. Klein is now one of the youngest general surgeons at Mount Sinai Beth Israel and boasts an astounding success rate, however when the scrubs come off, this doctor still feels she has work to do.   “On top of my actual surgical practice, I want to become an involved advocate for healthcare policy reform,” said Dr. Klein. “It’s such an important issue, and because of that it’s a little more likely that Teresa will hear about me and everything I’m up to if I become an outspoken figure on the topic. God, she will hate that.”   When reached for comment, Dr. Klein’s nemesis was happy to weigh in.   “I don’t remember ever saying something mean to Claudia but I feel so bad to hear that I did,” said Dr. Teresa Watkins. “I had a difficult childhood and my dad always put a lot of pressure on me so I was probably just projecting, not that that’s an excuse.”   “Anyway, I’m so glad she’s doing well,” continued Dr. Watkins, who is now a medical researcher. “Us women in STEM have to stick together!”   “No,” said Dr. Klein. “No, no, no, no, no. I win. I am the real doctor!”   We salute you, petty bitch!","Jul 2, 2019"
The 6 Hottest Up-and-Coming Cities For Millennials Who Cherish Bodily Autonomy,2066,"As the millennial generation ages, new cities are emerging as the most popular places to live, work, and cling desperately to the hope of maintaining agency over one’s own body. As many Millennials are more willing to pick up and move more than ever before, check out these six up-and-coming hot spots where people with uteruses are not legally seen as vessels…for now!   Colorado’s fast-growing capital offers stunning mountain views, more breweries than any other U.S. city, and the legal right to physical autonomy. While 87% of counties do not have an abortion provider, you’ll be just fine as long as you stay close to Denver. Not bad, for America!   You won’t bleed out from a DIY procedure in this seaside capital! This quaint college town is home to several performing arts venues, and the famous WaterFire art installation. Like its neighbor Massachusetts, Rhode Island will probably be one of the last holdouts in the great culture war where women are used as collateral.   Home to the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, the Canyon Road art galleries, and the largest indigenous art fair in the country, one of the best things about this artsy southwestern locale is that doctors can’t be imprisoned for providing healthcare to women. Yet! Better keep donating to the ACLU for now!     While less well-known than nearby hipster haven Portland, the smaller city of Bend offers ample opportunities for nature lovers to hike, kayak, and independently make personal, life-altering decisions about their present and future.   History, cherry blossoms, and politicians paying for their secret lovers’ abortions are timeless D.C. staples that constantly endure. Shack up in the nation’s capital and rest assured that access to reproductive healthcare is close, safe, and legal – plus you’ll get a front-row seat to the legal apocalypse heading its way any day now.   This tiny, charming coastal city has a population of just 3,000, and with three Canada-US border crossings, it is the place to escape the country before it goes full dystopia. Don’t forget to pack a go-bag!","May 16, 2019"
Why I’m Not Having Kids Unless Someone Leaves a Baby On My Doorstep,2127,"The idea of parenthood gives me a lot of anxiety. While I know a lot of people look forward to it and even think procreation is their life’s purpose, my response is: “Um, I’m okay, thanks.” Having kids just isn’t for me. That is, unless, someone anonymously leaves a bundled-up newborn in a cradle on my doorstep on a dark and stormy night.   Having kids isn’t financially possible for many adults in their childbearing years, especially millennials struggling through underpaying jobs, overwhelming student loan debt, and unaffordable health insurance. Raising a healthy child requires stable healthcare, having a home that can support a growing family, and being able to plan for a child’s future and success. But I suppose if, by chance, someone abandoned a little peanut on my front stoop in the dead of the night and I awoke to its pitiful cries, I’d step up and do the right thing, you know?     I’m also afraid of the harsh world I would bring a child into. It’s a scary time right now for various reasons. Compounded with possibly passing down mental health issues that run in my family, it could be disastrous for an innocent child entering this imperfect world. And the toll a pregnancy can take on a woman’s body? Can you imagine juggling all that along with your own financial burdens? I couldn’t, unless someone ding-dong ditched an infant on my front step. Then I’d have to and I absolutely would. I’m not saying do it, but I’m not not; you know what I mean?   There’s such a stigma against adults like me who elect not to make sacrifices necessary to have kids. Some of us don’t have that paternal instinct or entered careers and lifestyles that aren’t compatible with parenthood. It’s not fair for children to be raised by parents who can’t be there for them. So, of course, I’m not saying that parenting in general is wrong. I’m just saying that I’m exercising my choice not to have my kids unless destiny dumped an unclaimed one on my welcome mat. In that case, I’d accept that child and the accompanying parenthood I didn’t ask for with wide-open, non-soliciting arms.   Anyway, please give me a random baby.","Apr 29, 2019"
"Beto Made Me Wet, but Ocasio-Cortez is FLOODING My Pants",1930,"It’s no secret to anyone who reads real news that we had some exciting candidates running for office this fall. While I understand Beto was a popular liberal crush and I will admit I entertained the occasional daydream of him ramming me in a campaign office closet, the left-leaning candidate wielding the most fuck power is clearly Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. I mean, just look at her. Watch anything she does. I’m watching closely. And I like it.   Beto wore a dress once and that was pretty sexy. But Ocasio-Cortez is nonstop fierce fire and that is making me sweat. She led a protest on climate change. She’s refusing to suck Amazon’s dick, unlike Cuomo. She stands on tables, which is a surefire way to guarantee blood will rush to my genitals and make my panties damp.   I’m not saying I would kick Beto out of bed. He’s undeniably adorable! But Ocasio-Cortez looks amazingly sensual and cover-ready in her signature red lip but is also hot AF just chillin’ with no makeup on making mac and cheese in her kitchen on Instagram live. Basically however she looks I am drooling downstairs. I can’t help it, but she makes me wetter than an ocean, and I’ll stand by that.     Beto is a golden boy out of central casting in the 1940s. He’s Jimmy Stewart with a bigger dick. I don’t not want it, so don’t come at me! But Ocasio-Cortez is giving us former-bartender-can-still-barely-afford-an-apartment realness. She’s who I want fighting for me to have healthcare and housing and she’s who has ruined another pair of my underwear. Cause of me being wet as fuck, of course!   To all the people who feel differently, I agree that Beto is a smart guy you want to teach you a sexy lesson. But Ocasio-Cortez has the fierce nerd passion that makes your body absolutely leak. I genuinely hope Beto continues to find ways to lead and build coalitions. And I know Ocasio-Cortez will continue being a hot bitch who turns my vagina into a faucet.","Nov 15, 2018"
"Yasss! Black Women are KWEENS, Unless They’re Talking About Something I Can’t Relate To",1649,"As an intersectional feminist and a freelance blogger, I know it’s important to advocate for all of us, especially women of color. That’s why black women are KWEENS! Unless they’re talking about something that I can’t personally relate to – in which case, I really have no idea!   Black women have always held a key role in the fight for women’s rights: They’ve fought for the right to vote, the right to work, and our reproductive rights, right alongside white women. So it’s crucial to recognize the KWEENS that they are! But it’s also crucial that the black women around me make sure that they only discuss struggles that I myself can understand and relate to so I don’t feel exlcuded. Ahhh sorry!!!!   It’s not that I don’t care about the inadequate healthcare for black women, or the unfair assumptions made about their temperament or intelligence, it’s just that I feel left out of those conversations because I don’t experience any of that and don’t really have anything to add? If I can’t talk, how am I supposed to call them KWEENZZZ??     There is so much I want to celebrate about my GIRLS!! As long as we don’t talk about anything that I can’t identify with tho!!! For example, the wage gap between women and men? HELL YES QUAINS!! Or how about the additional wage gap between white women and black women? Now that’s where I gotta bow out! The black KWEENS I know and love understand that inclusion is important, especially when it comes to me!!   What I mean to say with all this is: Black women undeniably KWEENS, but are at their absolute KWEENiest when I know what they’re talking about and can actually relate to it!! YASSSS KWEENS!","Feb 2, 2018"
5 Protein Smoothies That Will Give You Enough Energy to Log on to Twitter,2585,"You’re a busy woman and it probably feels like you’ll never have as much time and energy as you need. Smoothies that are high in protein are a great way for women to pack a lot of high-energy foods into a meal that’s easy to prepare and strong enough to prepare you for going online. These five protein smoothies are the perfect way to consume the protein and energizing nutrients you need to log on to Twitter.   Coffee Protein Shake You’ll probably need both protein and caffeine to get through another day online. Why not combine them into a smoothie, which you can sip while reading another series of devastating personal stories about the fight for better healthcare coverage? The GOP is trying to ram another bill through the Senate? Take a sip! Mmm, delicious and nutritious!   Berry Chia Seed Smoothie Chia seeds might be small, but they pack enough protein that you’ll be able to participate in the exhausting ritual of refreshing Twitter for the 38th time today. Prepare a smoothie with chia seeds, juice or yogurt, and your favorite berries before you open the Twitter app, and you might just have enough energy left to do work instead of staring helplessly at a wall. It’s amazing what eating right can do!   Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie This smoothie is as delicious as it is protein-packed, providing you with both the energy and peace of mind you need to venture online. Peanut butter provides the protein you’ll need to read another Twitter thread about climate disasters, while the bananas will give your body enough nutrients to report six men, including the President, for targeted harassment. Superfoods, amirite?     Coconut Almond Smoothie This rich, creamy smoothie contains enough protein to sustain your social media addiction. The almonds will give you the mental energy to seriously ponder the questions: why am I on this app? Why do I bother? Am I learning or just confirming my own beliefs? Are we all going to die, or will just some of us die? Aren’t almonds amazing?   Healthy Greens Smoothie Throw some kale, spinach, and almond butter into a blender and pray that Donald Trump won’t tweet today. The nutrients in the greens will give you the sustenance you need to open Twitter, but kale can really only go so far. Better stuff cookies into your face to ease the pain!   Hopefully these protein-based smoothies will provide you with the stamina necessary to scroll through Twitter in the year 2017. Combine them with some turkey for lunch and a healthy salmon salad dinner, and you might be revitalized enough to allow Vox to explain something to you.","Sep 26, 2017"
Has Feminism Gone Too Far Now That It Is Specifically Critiquing Me?,2680,"I’m a devout feminist, possibly one of the most devout you’ll ever meet. From the minute I wake up until I fall asleep at night, the only thing I think about is women’s rights. However, I can’t help but wonder: Has feminism gone too far now that it is specifically critiquing me?   I’ve made many generous donations to Planned Parenthood throughout my life. That’s just part of what being a good feminist entails – supporting women’s healthcare. And if you don’t believe the money I’ve donated, read my receipts. Hold them in your hands. Memorize the amounts. I’m definitively an ally to all women everywhere, but even I have my limits.   What are my limits? Well, they begin with me and end with me when I’m facing criticism.   So, with this in mind, let’s discuss objectively why questioning my behavior means the failure of feminism.     First off, feminism has no hierarchy. If it did, my efforts would likely land me at around a Level 8. As a theoretical Level 8 feminist with years of feminist experience, I’m not only appalled, but also profoundly disturbed that my peers would seek to challenge me in absolutely any way. For example, labeling me a “faux feminist” simply because I use my platform to hawk luxury goods, thereby profiting off women’s ambitions while refusing to support actual policies that would help them achieve those ambitions? Wow.   Attacking other women, in this case exclusively me, is against everything feminism stands for.   Of course, I’m all for the optics of female empowerment. But when we begin to apply the ideals to personal conduct, i.e. mine, I feel we have a collective responsibility to take a step back for a moment and ask ourselves: Have we finally gone too far?   I speak out of concern not only for myself, but for the state of modern feminism now that it has inarguably shifted into something ugly and negative, namely in and around the space that is me. If I, a woman who calls herself a feminist, am forced to face minute criticism by my female peers, then what’s next? Me facing MORE criticism? For God’s sake! I sell a $900 T-shirt that says “FEMINIST” on it. Trust me when I tell you, you have the wrong girl.   Women can’t “fight the patriarchy” effectively if we can’t even concede to me that I’m right all the time. How can we expect to be taken seriously as a gender when we can’t blindly agree?   If I seem defensive, I’m not. You are.   I’m being unfairly punished by my fellow women for following my brave decision to not listen to any of them. That’s a consequence I will simply have to accept. However, believe me when I tell you that we need to do better as feminists. And we can start by no longer criticizing me.","Sep 7, 2017"
How To Bravely Express Your Opinion Now That Everyone Else Shares It,2639,"Six months ago you might have needed some kind of backbone to express your opinions. But the time has come to stand up, be counted, and make your voice heard on the most challenging issues that everybody you know already agrees on. Here is how to stand up and finally say, “This is what I believe, and what we all happen to believe because it’s a cool and normal belief now.” Here’s how, you, too, can join this noble (and luckily popular – phew!) fight.   Pick An Issue Before you can express an opinion, you have to have an opinion, so take a look at the world around you and try to find ways to fix it that have been around for decades but which we’re finally gonna do now, for some reason. Like universal healthcare! Maybe you didn’t pay much attention to this issue when Hillary Clinton was campaigning for it in the 1990s, but now everyone seems to think universal healthcare is a good thing, so alternate between calling your senators and tweeting about calling your senators so people know you’re really taking a stand. Voilà! You’re brave now!   Share An Article The easiest way to take a vocal stance on an issue is to find someone else’s more researched stance and then post their op-ed with the caption “this.” No need to weigh in and add any nuance to their take. On any issue, from the situation in Syria to the wage gap to whitewashing, “this” is all you have to say to stand for what’s right after enough other people have already said it. You finally speaking up now that it’s commonplace? Now THAT’S “this.”   Make It About Yourself The best part about having once-controversial but now-widely-accepted opinions is how you can show others that you’ve actually been cool all along! When someone shares a detailed, well-thought-out and reasonable argument about why calling out transphobic jokes isn’t the same thing as censorship, you should definitely comment that you actually never liked that comedian anyway. Or when one of your POC friends expresses dissatisfaction with a musician’s appropriation of black hip-hop culture in a music video, you absolutely need to chime in with how you don’t listen to that music anyway. Never admit that you may have learned something about your own privilege, ever. Always brag about your long-held superiority. That’s the choice that takes courage!     When you think back, you probably could have deduced which causes were worth standing up for a long time ago. However, it’s just so much easier now that everyone is on the same page and you know you’re not going to get too much flack for it. Do the work to fight for what’s right now that you know it won’t require as much work!","Aug 30, 2017"
Woman Who Regrets Voting for Trump Still Pretty Racist,2286,"Janet Ballard of Poughkeepsie, New York, now wishes she hadn’t voted for President Trump. However, she’s still super racist.   While Ballard had somewhat opened her mind to others’ viewpoints after the election — viewpoints like “maybe we shouldn’t dump coal into streams” or “I want my children to have health insurance” — at the end of the day, she still really just likes one race, and one race only.   “Do I wish Trump would stop tweeting out nonsense? Yes. Do I wish he would stop trying to take away my healthcare, sure,” Ballard said. “Do I still mutter ‘Go back to your country’ when my server at Chili’s gets my order wrong, even if they’re a Sicilian-American who was born in Iowa? You betcha. I just thought we’d have that big beautiful wall by now. To keep out the illegals. He’s really let me down.”   While Ballard has admitted that, since November 9, Trump seems like “not such a great guy after all” and is “probably worse than my ex-husband,” she still can’t quite put her finger on why she strongly dislikes the only woman of color at her workplace. When asked about her co-worker, Ballard said, “Just something about her I don’t like,” and then told an anecdote that stereotyped the woman based solely on skin color. “I also really thought Hillary would be in prison by now,” she added. “Obama too. Like that woman at work, there’s just something about him.”     Ballard’s daughter, Amy, initially welcomed her mom’s newfound anti-Trump views with open arms. “I thought, ‘Cool, she feels bad for voting for him. That’s great!’” Amy said. “But then at the grocery store, the cashier — a lovely man who happens to be from India — told us how much we owed, and my mom scoffed and said, ‘You’re just looking for a handout.’ Then she walked outside and said to an Indian man in a suit, ‘Why is our cashier following me to my car?’ So yeah. I guess she’s still crazy racist.”   While Amy is worried about her mom’s racism, she’s confident that it’s a step in the right direction. “It could be worse,” Amy said. “My mom could like Trump and hate people of color. No, wait, never mind. It’s still pretty bad.”   Ballard was last seen scraping a Trump/Pence bumper sticker off the back of her car while complaining about her neighbors who, she said, “don’t quite fit in here.”","May 11, 2017"
Cool Smart Liberal Guy Silent,2171,"As Donald Trump’s presidency threatens the foundations of democracy, self-proclaimed progressive Gavin Owens, a cool smart liberal guy, has remained startlingly silent on all social media, when talking to his racist grandparents, and unintentionally walking by protests.   Owens’ silence in the face of a borderline fascist regime contradicts years of liberal leanings. His favorite book, which he has carried in his back pocket on first dates for six years straight, is Henry David Thoreau’s Civil Disobedience. He’s been at the forefront of such noted liberal causes as marijuana legalization, describing himself as a feminist, and wearing mismatching socks because “fuck the system.” However, massive political organizing by his peers seems to have soured the liberal cause.   “I’m a progressive through and through,” Owens says. “I don’t need to speak up in order to prove that.”   Owens held to his position over the weekend, despite the fact that people were protesting at airports in response to an actual enacted threat to refugees, Muslims, and U.S. citizens.   In fact, Owens hasn’t hauled his Herschel backpack to any recent protests that have occurred in and around his Brooklyn neighborhood.   “I’ve seen the Snapchat videos, and all that chanting is groupthink,” he explains. “It’s just as bad as blindly following Trump.” However, his ex-girlfriends suspect that his disinterest is rooted in the fact that it is nearly impossible to protest ironically, and also that he has never read 1984, despite his insistence that others do.   “I always assumed he was a liberal because he liked hiking,” laments Mara White, whom Owens broke up with because she couldn’t attend one of his poetry readings. “But he hasn’t even posted to Facebook about the Affordable Care Act, which is where he gets his healthcare.”     “Social media doesn’t do anything,” Owens responds. “It’s an echo chamber.” This opinion hasn’t deterred him from promoting his SoundCloud four times in the past month.   At the end of the day, Owens will at least be able to feel proud that he stuck to his core belief: speaking earnestly about something when you’re not trying to get laid is lame.","Feb 1, 2017"
Incredible! This GOP Senator Refuses to Learn What an IUD Is,2400,"Most people desire to be prepared for work, but one Republican Senator is willing to enter the workplace completely unprepared to speak to the issue on which he is actively passing legislature. That’s right—Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri absolutely refuses to learn what an IUD is.   Honestly, even we’re impressed!   According to reports, Blunt is devoted to legislating women’s healthcare, but isn’t fully aware of what women’s healthcare actually is.   “He’s hell-bent on hobbling Planned Parenthood, yet he doesn’t even know that an IUD is a T-shaped birth control device inserted in the uterus,” says aide Cassandra Miller. “I can understand having to learn new things in old age, but Senator Blunt just says things like, ‘Get out of my office with that thing, I don’t want to see that.’”   Millions of Americans are awed by the willful ignorance of this man whose vote will determine if women live or die. Wow!   Supporters of Blunt don’t feel his lack of knowledge is a problem.   “He doesn’t need to know what things are to hate them,” 44-year-old Gary Britton says. “I’ve never even tasted sour cream, but any time a waitress puts them on my nachos, I yell at her. That’s my right.”   According to reports, many people have attempted to educate Senator Blunt but he has refused.   “Sometimes I just gently knock on his door and say, ‘Excuse me, Senator, would you like to learn about different birth control options?’” an anonymous staffer shares. “It’s almost gotten me fired like ten times. He really doesn’t care, unless it’s in a context where he can take it away from women.” Now that’s incredible!   Another staffer confirms Blunt’s utter obliviousness.   “He think IUD stands for ‘Inner Upper Diaphragm,” she shares. “But I think he’s just referring to the body part, not the contraceptive device.”   Dozens of other Republican senators support his stance.     “So what if we don’t know what an IUD is?” Senator Marco Rubio asks. “We aren’t even fully clear on what an abortion is and we just totally made up the term partial-birth abortion. Why can’t we do that with long-term, safe contraception?”   At press time, all the Republican male senators were seen texting under the table as Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke on the Senate floor.   Says one senator, “We’ll listen when the topic is something actually relevant to our lives.”   We’re so, so amazed by Senator Blunt’s resolve!  ","Jan 11, 2017"
How To Avoid Jessica At The Women’s March On Washington,2214,"The Women’s March On Washington is set to be the largest inaugural demonstration in history. On January 21, up to 200,000 people of diverse backgrounds will gather to demand protection of women’s rights, personal safety and access to healthcare as we shift into uncertain times. Here’s how to avoid that ubiquitous pain in the neck, Jessica, who’s also going to the march, because of fucking course she is:   Ignore Jessica’s texts. Jessica already saw your excited post, so it’s too late to act like you’re not going. But you can still ignore any “Hey, how are you getting to DC?” and “I’m in DC!!! Where are you???” texts from her. God, she’s so fucking intense. When she sees your Snapchats with Gloria Steinem speaking in the background, just play dumb and blame the bad reception if Jessica finds you and asks you why you don’t call her anymore.   Write your sign with your non-dominant hand. While exercising your right to demonstrate, proceed with caution in making your poster by using your non-dominant hand. She’ll never recognize your scrawl of “LOVE TRUMPS HATE.” And it’s not a lie—you don’t hate Jessica, you just can’t stand her, and no amount of love can change that.     Avoid initiating new chants. While it’s totally fine to join chants already in progress, if you really want to avoid Jessica, don’t give into temptation to start a new chant yourself. You’ll definitely catch her attention if you start asking what a feminist looks like. Let Jessica focus on what the other 199,000 feminists look like and stay off your jock. God.   Duck behind a Port-a-potty. With that many women in one place, you know the Port-a-potty line is going to be slow and long—that’s not misogynistic, it’s just true! It takes longer to sit down! So if Jessica approaches the area, duck and cover. The last thing you need in Trump’s America is to get sucked into another dumb fucking conversation with Jessica about her compost pile that caught fire.   The Women’s March On Washington is one of the most important demonstrations of our lifetime. Thousands of women and femme expressive people will gather in the name of sisterhood. But thankfully, that doesn’t mean you have to hang out with Jessica, not this time.","Jan 9, 2017"
Incredible! This Woman Doesn’t Need to Win an Argument to Feel Morally Superior About It,2114,"This week, 26-year-old Andrea Shieh proved that she could lose an argument and still feel completely morally superior to her opponent, all at the same time.   “My aunt and I got into this heated argument when she said she voted third party in the election, and I called her decision selfish and then we just kind of yelled back and forth from there,” says Shieh. “I didn’t win the argument. Nobody did. But that didn’t stop me from feeling morally superior to her for making the right choice.”   Shieh walked away with her head held high, proving that you don’t need to accomplish anything in a debate to walk away feeling like the better person.   “She does this a lot,” says Shieh’s sister, Pam. “She’ll see an opportunity to call someone out without even giving them any logical explanation of why. The amazing thing is she doesn’t even need to get through to the other person to feel satisfied with herself.”     “It’s not really about winning or losing,” says Shieh. “It’s more about loudly asserting my beliefs so everyone knows I have them because I am right. And because they’re the right ones, I feel pretty pleased about it regardless of who I’m failing to convince.”   What an inspiration! Shieh doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to being honest about her self-righteous motivations.   “One time, a lady in a giant SUV with a bunch of American flag stickers backed into me in the parking lot,” says Shieh. “So I started telling her off about carbon emissions until she drove away. I didn’t make a difference, but I still felt proud of myself.”   Shieh later admitted the parking lot incident was technically her fault since she parked directly behind the SUV. But in a remarkable feat of moral indignation, she still felt herself to be in the right overall.   “Sure, I pulled right up to her bumper. But even if I’m being the shitty one in the situation, at least I’m driving an electric car. That counts for something, right? I think it does, and that’s all that matters.”   At the conclusion of the interview Shieh was seen losing an argument with her sister about universal access to healthcare.","Jan 9, 2017"
6 Mall Santas Who Have Better Health Insurance Than You,2256,"Being a Mall Santa is hard work, but if Santa plans and saves well, he can afford decent health insurance with a pretty low deductible. In spite of their humble jobs, here are six mall Santas that have a lot better health insurance than you right now.   Roger Berger, Stoneridge Shopping Center By securing one of the most coveted store Santa positions around, Roger is able to afford a Cigna healthcare plan so solid you can only dream of its pleasures. This plan’s benefits are great for Roger who has type II diabetes, and would also be amazing for you, who has several mysterious conditions that are going to remain undiagnosed.   Joel McCormick, Mall of America The Mall of America Santa season starts early, which is great for Joel, who has a limited number of weeks to secure his seasonal pay. Luckily this renowned mall pays well and covers housing, allowing Joel to afford Kaiser Permanente health insurance that covers mental healthcare, something he’ll need in the off-season and worrying about next year. Can you imagine having mental health coverage?! Of course you can’t. Your plan has a $6000 deductible.   Gerald Hooks, King of Prussia Mall Gerald makes enough in two months of letting kids sit on his lap to cover a year of his Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, which offers him a low $10 copay on even Tier 4 drugs. Your plan might be helpful if you end up in the ER, but you’re not betting on it.   Dan Hagar, Five Points Mall Thanks to the Affordable Care Act Dan’s pre-existing conditions didn’t disqualify him from his Aetna plan. But you unfortunately will be disqualified by your lack of a spare $1099 a month. This man who spends his entire day in a mall has outdone you.     Jim Winooski, Tucson Mall Jim once farted loudly in front of a child on the job, but he still has a great United Healthcare plan. You work long into the evening but your employer contributes nothing to your monthly healthcare premiums because you’re technically part-time.   Huck Winslow, Mall of Georgia You have a mole that really needs to be looked at. Huck got two prostrate exams last year, just because. He is a good Santa so we guess he deserves it?   Good health insurance is hard to come by, especially for you. But these mall Santas have found a way.","Dec 8, 2016"
"Let’s Agree To Disagree, Then Ultimately Learn Nothing From Each Other",2908,"One thing’s for sure: Our nation is more polarized than ever before. Bridging the gap between left and right feels like an impossible task when both sides are so different from each other. After months of contentious debate, I’m done with all this arguing, so for the sake of keeping the peace, let’s agree to disagree, then ultimately learn nothing from each other.   This seems like the most civil way to produce the least amount of change possible.   As someone who considers herself a peacekeeper, I feel more comfortable living in a world where everyone gets along. So when we disagree, I simply want us to stop, breathe, and learn to love each other despite our differences of opinion, gaining absolutely nothing from the experience. Isn’t it inspiring to know that we can achieve? I think so! And if you disagree with me, that’s okay, because we can both quietly believe we’re right instead of engaging in a way that might change the way we think.   I’m not asking to avoid difficult conversations. We need to talk openly about controversial topics such as race, women’s access to healthcare and foreign affairs. But we shouldn’t let our vastly different opinions on these topics divide us, just because we think differently from each other. We should accept each other’s differences without trying to change them so we can all remain ignorant in our own special, flawed way forever. I like to call this “taking the high road.” I would encourage you to try it sometime! Although if you don’t, I will respect your decision by completely ignoring it.     Of course, we should all make an effort to listen to each other more without being afraid of hearing a different point of view. For example, though I think we should increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, I would be happy to hear someone out who thinks we should turn Wall Street into some kind of financial free-for-all. So let’s just say I respect what you have to say, but let’s agree to quit while we’re ahead, and never challenge our belief system in any way so we can maintain this forced acquaintance, shall we?   Am I just a hopeful sap for thinking this seems like the most civil way to never face our most deeply ingrained prejudices and ill-informed opinions?   I’m heartbroken by the anger on both sides of the political spectrum. One side yelling for this, the other side yelling for that. Everyone feeding into the worst parts of each other. It just feels so futile to know that despite what anyone says, I will continue to believe what I choose to believe no matter what, so fuck you.   After all, it shouldn’t be our political opinions, but our love that binds us. So let’s talk to each other, then stop talking when we realize the other person is wrong. Let’s listen to each other, then politely dismiss the effort. Let’s agree to disagree, so we can ultimately remain shielded from the pain of new knowledge forever and ever.","Sep 30, 2016"
Drinks To Let Him Buy You Because Birth Control Costs $50 A Pack,2939,"So, a guy wants to buy you a drink and you’re hesitant about letting him. Your hand automatically reaches for your purse to indicate that you’re willing to pay for yourself. Why are you doing that? You may have a great career and earn more than him, but your birth control still costs $50 a pack. Here are some drinks to go ahead and let him by because women’s healthcare isn’t getting any cheaper:   Gin and Tonic Initially invented as a cheap antimalarial treatment, gin and tonics now cost $17 for some reason. Let your boyfriend buy you one despite your reluctance to reinforce this gender norm. Don’t worry! Remind yourself you’re already paying $50 a pack for a basic medication that should be free. Birth control gives you the ability to plan your life without being hindered by untimely, unwanted pregnancies—a fear men never have to live with! In fact, their inability to get pregnant only gives them more advantages. So just let him buy you this, just this once.   Subak-Soju Subak-Soju is a watermelon juice cocktail that this Citibank analyst wants to buy you, so why not let him? After all, every night he probably showers in the cash he made that day and then flushes it down the toilet. Meanwhile, you’re dropping enough money on birth control to take yourself out for a nice dinner on your own. Did you know that if everyone had access to them, it could prevent up to 71% of the abortions performed in the U.S. annually, and 100% of the abortions performed on you, ever? Repeat this logic to yourself as you let him to buy you this one stupid drink!   The Pavlova You’ll feel as sunny as this apricot cocktail tastes when you say, “Okay fine, you can pay for my drink.” After all, your birth control still costs as much as a budget airline flight to Chicago, even though birth control being free could save the U.S. billions of dollars a year. Because when unwanted pregnancies decrease, so do the costs of public assistance, health care and income lost as a result of lower education among children born to teenage, or otherwise unprepared mothers. So cheers! Just let your date pay for this round because he’ll never have to worry about this stuff.   Bloody Mary The Bloody Mary is a unique blend of tomato juice and vodka that you can just let your boyfriend buy for you. If you feel weird about it, remind yourself that no one’s trying to regulate his body. However, people still protest that insurance covers the birth control you need for your polycystic ovarian syndrome, because they think that women exclusively use birth control for having premarital sex. But many birth control users cite different medical issues ranging from acne to ovarian cancer. At least let your boyfriend be the one leaking money tonight when he pays for this cocktail.   Women’s access to birth control has improved a lot over the years, and there’s still more to be done. In the meantime, at least you didn’t have to pay for this drink?","Aug 29, 2016"

Whether it’s an upset tummy or chronic stomach pain you never had checked out, citrine has your back, unless it’s a serious medical condition. Then you better hold onto that citrine real tight and figure your insurance shit out.     Amethyst If you’re losing sleep because you’re worried about going bankrupt without medical insurance, you need an amethyst. Amethyst will calm your worries and help fight insomnia, at least we hope. If not, buckle up for a panic attack. You’re gonna need the help of a professional.   Aquamarine If your allergies are acting up on your three-day trek through the jungle to see a shaman, get some aquamarine to help fight your reaction to the natural environment.. But this one happens to work best when paired with over-the-counter allergy medicine so you better buck up and buy some of that, too.   A year without health insurance is no big deal when you have the magical powers of crystals in your medicine cabinet. Whatever ailment befalls you, there’s a crystal out there to rub on it—but like, you should really try to get insurance again, cause rocks can only help you so much.","Aug 26, 2016"
5 Up-and-Coming Cities to Move To After You Sleep With Your Roommate,2683,"New York, L.A., Chicago, Portland, and Austin get a lot of love, but there are great cities all across the country that are becoming cultural and economic centers.

Have fun in this fourth-tier city!   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Pittsburgh is a great place to live! There are theaters, the famous Andy Warhol Museum, and lots and lots of bridges. And speaking of bridges, it stinks that you burned a bridge with your roommate by going down on him on your sweet back patio that you can no longer enjoy. Since you technically weren’t on the lease and he’s been there the longest, it’s time for you to find a new home in this once-bustling milltown!   Minneapolis, Minnesota Minneapolis is the birthplace of famous musician Prince, which is sort of cool. It’s also one of the most bike-friendly cities in America, which means getting around will be super easy; just like how easy it was to bang your roommate on your shared laminate countertop. He was just so THERE all the time, you know?   Burlington, Vermont Burlington is the new hipster hangout with a focus on sustainability, where restaurants largely cook with local ingredients and residents get their groceries from co-ops. Don’t give a shit about the environment? You should have thought about that before you screwed your roommate against the exposed brick wall in your living room. Say goodbye to your home and hello to organic produce!     Asheville, North Carolina You might have never heard of Asheville, but this southern gem has a great beer community as well as plenty of opportunities to escape into nature. True, you despise the outdoors, but you’ll have to get over that because you humped someone who doesn’t want to date you but does manage to see you before seven o’clock in the morning every day. Living in Asheville will still be better than awkwardly sharing a bathroom after this doozy!   Now that your roommate has seen you naked, it’s time to find a new place to live. These up-and-coming cities won’t meet your expectations at all, but they will help you forget that thing that happened that made everybody in the apartment feel super weird. Happy travels!","Aug 15, 2016"
How to Save Money Without Giving Up Boxed Water,2089,"Cutting back on luxuries to save money can be challenging, especially when your boxed water is at stake. While bottled water is a wasteful indulgence, boxed water makes your carbon footprint smaller and makes you feel rich, which is really important to you. Here’s how you can still afford boxed water by cutting back on these other things you enjoy:   Cut Out Going Out for Coffee Spending $3.50 on a latte every day can really add up! Why not save that money you could be spending on your daily java habit and spend it on boxed water instead? Just march right out of your house where the faucets and reusable plastic water bottles live, and right past your local coffee shop. Instead, try making your own coffee at home and putting it in your empty boxed water containers. Win-win!   Budget According to Your Priorities What expenditures are the most important in your life? Is your car insurance really that much more important than drinking reverse osmosis water from a milk carton? As the saying goes, “Boxed water is better and I’ll just drive more carefully from now on!”   Pay Yourself First Set aside the money you need for your savings, bills and your monthly boxed water allotment. The leftover money is what you have for the rest of your budget for more frivolous things, like food and gas and healthcare. This way you won’t have to think about anything, except how long you can make your boxed water allotment last ‘til next Thursday.     Use Cash Credit cards make it easy to spend money without thinking, so switch to cash instead. This way, when you’re at Whole Foods, it’ll feel more real that you just spent $39 on a case of water that comes in a box. Drink up!   Try to Get Things for Free With a little research, there are lots of things you can actually get for free! Just like water, you can actually find some expensive items are literally on tap. Like water! Sounds crazy, but it can totally help you afford more boxed water!   Remember, if you can’t afford your actual water bill, you can always use all that boxed water you bought. It has fewer chemicals, anyway!","Jun 1, 2016"
"If Trump Becomes President, I’m Moving In With My Boyfriend",2397,"If Donald Trump is elected president this November, I will no longer feel safe in my own home. I will have no choice but to pack up and move to a place where the future is brighter—where I will be able to not just survive, but also thrive.   I will be forced to move all the way across town to my boyfriend’s place.   President Trump will implement policies that are reactionary and driven by fear. The violence that would inevitably stem from these policies would be nothing short of horrific. But if my boyfriend and I can spend all day lying around in the bed we share, it will be like the rest of the world doesn’t even exist. Good luck, America! I’m taking care of myself.   A Trump presidency will mean harsh immigration reform that will cost the federal government up to $600 billion. In the ten months we’ve been dating, my boyfriend and I have never discussed money— we just hang out a couple times a week and talk about television and have sex. Sure, we’ll have to figure out rent and bills if we move in together, but if we lose our jobs as a result of economic collapse, splitting one Netflix account will be easier on both of us. Hello, paradise!     As Commander-in-Chief, Trump will cut access to women’s healthcare and limit the choices we are able to make for our own bodies. You might think this will be a huge problem for me because my boyfriend’s apartment is a windowless basement unit with no chairs or room for a crib, but you’re wrong! If I decide to get an IUD while access to contraception is heavily regulated, I can get my boyfriend to help me insert it. Cohabitation is the most convenient option for DIY healthcare. Life hack much?   As 45th president, Donald Trump vows to build a wall along the Mexican border. No thank you! I’d much rather live with my boyfriend, which will break down barriers within our nation—specifically, the emotional ones between the two of us since we’ve never really talked about our future together. But I know he supports me! When I told him my plans to move in if Trump wins, he laughed and said, “I’m With Her,” while taking a bong rip. You see? He’s with me. The world’s too small for walls.   A Trump presidency could conceivably result in horrific civil war. But please, don’t bother trying to convince his supporters to change their vote. After all, I have a plan in a Trump-controlled America—and it’s a romantic dream come true!","Apr 5, 2016"
I’m Not Political (Because I Assume I Will Retain All of My Privileges Forever),2594,"Listen guys, I get it. You hate the orange guy with the crazy hair. You love the old guy with the crazy hair. You think Hillary is a woman but she sends too many emails. Wow, you’re soooo political. Good for you.   I just don’t like to get into that sort of thing. I’d rather abstain from all the petty name-calling and meme-swapping because I believe that life is about more than just politics. (Also, because I’m pretty sure that whatever happens will not affect my day-to-day life in any way because I’m not a member of a historically oppressed group.)     I guess politics has never appealed to me because I just don’t enjoy arguing (things I do enjoy: massages, sriracha, extreme privilege as the result of a class system rigged in my favor, NOT ARGUING). I don’t need to spend hours debating what led to the Iraq War—it feels like it went by super fast anyways (since no one in my social circle had to join the military to pay for college). It’s not important to me that I understand the best solution to economic inequality—my great-grandfather invented steel. While some people need to always be right, I would rather always be kind. Maybe if everyone were always kind, we wouldn’t even need politics (I don’t know what poverty is because my father invested in soybean futures).   Honestly, if more people were like me (low-key rich, able-bodied), we wouldn’t have to have these fights about things that don’t affect me and never will.   Another thing I don’t like about politics is how it divides people. I believe that we are all the same (almost all my friends went to the same college). So I think we should be able to find common ground when it comes to the major issues affecting our lives, whatever those may be. My best friend is actually a socially conservative libertarian and I have never once let that come between us because I have never asked her what that means and she always has weed.     If you’ve been on social media lately, you know that it can seem like politics is impossible to avoid. But imagine for a second what would happen if we replaced all the angry rants about healthcare and immigration with pictures of kittens and puppies. I, for one, would definitely feel better. I already have healthcare and don’t know why anyone would want to change countries—it sounds like it would be really difficult!   In conclusion, I know it’s fun sometimes to get all riled up and scream at the TV. But I’m pretty sure that, come November, whether we elect the guy from The Apprentice or the guy from Curb Your Enthusiasm, everything is going to be okay (at least for me).","Feb 11, 2016"
9 Hunky TV Doctors Who Aren’t in Your PPO Network,3019,"Half the fun of watching soapy medical dramas on TV is ogling the stubbly, lab coat-wearing heartthrobs that save fictional lives every day. The other half is pointing at the TV and saying, ‘That would never happen!” especially when it comes to doctors treating patients without first laying out an odious payment plan. After all, even though most of us wish we could have any of these beefcake doctors check our quickening pulses, the odds of them being in your preferred provider organization are slim to none. Here are our fave studly docs whom you could never afford to be healed by.   1. Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney) – E.R. This heartthrob pediatrician is the only guy you’d take your kid to a first date with. Be prepared to foot his $2000 consultation fee, though, especially since we heard he’s leaving his practice to start a film career.   2. Dr. Derek Shepard (Patrick Dempsey) – Grey’s Anatomy Staring into McDreamy’s eyes before he puts you under for surgery sounds like a, well, dream, until you get the itemized invoice that betrays your bank account the way he betrayed Addison. Expect to be waiting for treatment for about as long as we’ve been waiting for this show to end.   Tell him what you don’t like about yourself, but only if it’s a non-cosmetic, involuntary medical procedure. Otherwise, you’ll have to find someone else to take you from an 8 to a 10.   4. Dr. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina) – The Mindy Project This no-nonsense OB-GYN doesn’t take pulling a person out of you lightly, nor does he take Anthem Blue Cross. Damn!   5. Dr. Jack Shepherd (Matthew Fox) – Lost The fact that he’s stuck on an island isn’t the only reason Jack can’t see you; his practice also doesn’t accept Cygna. Better pray that in the end, your flu was just one long dream.   6. Dr. John Dorian (Zach Braff) – Scrubs Keep daydreaming, because this adorable goofball is gonna boot your ass to the free clinic. You can’t do this aaaall on yoooooour own, but you might have to. Sorry!   7. Dr. Leonard “Bones” McCoy (DeForest Kelly) – Star Trek He’s a general practitioner, damn it, not a specialist. Find an ENT that takes HealthNet and get off of his ship. There’s no way you could afford space travel; you can barely afford your copays!   People assume that healthcare is a strict progression of injury to treatment, but actually, from a non-linear, out-of-network viewpoint, it’s more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly virtually unpayable bills. (If you love the show and are scraping to get by, you’ll love that reference!)   9. Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) – House, M.D. Just when you thought House would finally send a gerbil into your uterus to try and save your baby, you were kicked to the curb. Oh well—perhaps you’ll be able to find a blue-eyed medical mastermind at the CVS minute clinic!   Who knows? Maybe someone just as good as one of these dreamboat docs will happen to be within your network. Until then, it’s the old “pray you don’t die because you didn’t get that MRI” routine. Good luck!","Jan 18, 2016"
10 Girls Who Code But Are Also Licensed Scuba Instructors,3875,"Sexism is rampant in the tech industry, but these badass ladies won’t let gender stereotypes keep them from diving into traditionally male careers—or the ocean! These women inspire us to go after our dreams whether they involve blazing new trails in Silicon Valley or just chillin’ at the bottom of the sea. Here’s a list of some of our favorite women who code and are also licensed scuba instructors.   Eleanor Smith, 37, San Francisco, CA Eleanor is a senior UX designer at one of the hottest start-ups in San Francisco, where she spearheads a mentoring program for young women in tech. But on weekends she lets her fun side show, teaching the mentees how to scuba dive for free because she is a licensed deep-sea diving instructor.   Diana Ng, 22, Palo Alto, CA Diana recently graduated at the top of her class at Stanford with a degree in Computer Science and is considering positions at tech companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Google. But no matter where she ends up, Diana instructs scuba freelance in her downtime. “Yeah, I love scuba diving,” she tells us. Cool!   Samantha Tom, 23, Big Island, HI Tired of always having to choose between her two passions, coding and diving, Sam founded S(C++)UBA: the first underwater coding school. Talk about having it all!     Jacqueline Parsons, 27, Morehead City, NC Jacqueline was always told she was “too pretty” to be a web designer. But under the sea she’s accepted for who she is—because when everyone is wearing a wetsuit, it doesn’t matter how pretty you are. As she puts it, “We’re all the same when we’re surrounded by bubbles.” Wow!   Bernadette Song, 32, San Francisco, CA “I have to work twice as hard as my male colleagues to be taken seriously,” Bernadette says of her role as a backend engineer. “It’s definitely a sexist workplace environment. But you know what isn’t sexist? The ocean. And so I dive.”   Cameron Astarita, 53, Los Angeles, CA Each time she emerges from a dive, software programmer Cameron cries tears of joy into her mask because the dramatic change in pressure “feels like breaking through the glass ceiling.” She is a CEO somewhere. Way to code, scuba girl!   Christine Dunn, 28, Galveston, TX Christine has actually found the tech community to be much more progressive than the scuba community, which she describes as a boy’s club: “Yeah, my company is super willing to give me all the support I need to pursue a career in software development without compromising my personal goals like starting a family. But those Neanderthals over at the scuba school who think a woman’s place is on land? They can eat my wake.” Go get ’em , Christine!     Francesca “Frankie” Papa, 42, Hollywood, FL Frankie is known as a live wire, but unlike actual live wires, she’s great at being in the water! As she hurriedly told us via Skype, “I fucking love diving. I love it so much. I wish I could fuck the ocean. If I could fuck the deep sea I would just wrap my vagina around the whole ocean and fuck it, let it fill me up with salt.” Wow! She also designs government healthcare websites.   Meghan Duyssen, 38, San Jose, CA Meg is actually no longer a licensed scuba instructor following a gruesome but accidental drowning incident during one of her classes, but she still knows Java really well. “I love building websites for my friends,” says Duyssen. ‘That’s all I’m allowed to do these days.”   Brit Charleston, 4, U.S. Virgin Islands Brit is a freelance web designer and a flounder. She has an Open Water/Adventure Diver certification and is a fish.   If they taught coding classes we would sign up right now, but unfortunately these kickass ladies only teaching diving. If you would like to learn how to scuba dive, feel free to reach out to them, but please do not contact them for instructions in coding. They know how to code, but they do not like to teach it. They like to teach scuba. Women!","Dec 2, 2015"
"I’m Ready to Take Down The Patriarchy, As Soon As I Figure Out Who Stole My Fucking Hair Tie",3073,"Women—it’s time to come together to make a change. We are here, alive in the year 2015, and we still live in a society controlled by the straight white male. Not only is the patriarchy thriving—it’s tightening its grip over us. I cannot stand for this any longer. We must fight. The downfall of the oppressive state is necessary for the liberation of all women. I have committed my life to taking down this obscene patriarchy, as soon as I find my fucking hair tie because I swear to God I just had it and my hair is making me nuts right now.   The most visible instance of female subjugation comes from the media’s portrayal of an unrealistic standard of beauty for women. Why should they get to decide what’s beautiful? We should all be able to feel comfortable in our own skin—body positivity is the first step to destroying the patriarchy. The minute I find my hair tie, I’m going to pull together a quick ponytail and get to work.   Not that there’s anything wrong with having a wild and unrestrained mane, but it’s just easier to obliterate male hegemony when my hair is contained in one area and out of my face. This is why the “Find My Fucking Hair Tie ASAP Before More Hair Gets In My Mouth” initiative is so imperative.   And let’s not even get started on the wage gap. What gives men the right to make more money than women? The 33 fewer cents I’m getting paid is hitting my hair tie budget hard, so I should really focus on getting this one back. Seriously, where did it even go? I know I gave one to Lisa a couple of nights ago when she was puking her guts into my toilet, but I definitely recall having an extra. I always have an extra, except for right now. What the eff?     The opposition against Planned Parenthood is disgusting. We need to support the right for women to have access to healthcare, especially in low-income communities. We are in control of our own bodies—we reserve the right to take birth control or get an abortion, and no one can take that away. As a woman, I have the right to an abortion, along with a complimentary hair tie in the case that I lose my original hair tie. Does Planned Parenthood have hair ties? No? That’s a real fucking oversight on everyone’s part. The war between the patriarchy and I will remain at a stalemate until this pressing issue is resolved. My neck is legit injured from tossing my hair out of my face right now. I deserve better!   In this fight, we cannot forget women of color, who are hurt even more by the patriarchal standards of society. In addition to being denied the basic rights given to men, we women of color have to push against racial and socioeconomic inequality while also having different hair than white people, which can affect what sort of hair ties we want, which makes it even freaking worse when we lose them, especially when they were right here a minute ago. Holy shitting hell where is that thing?   I am going to shave my head at this point because I really cannot live sans-hair tie for much longer. Also, straight white men can suck it. Also, has anybody seen my Chapstick?","Dec 1, 2015"
Fun Weekend Getaways to Fill the 48-Hour Abortion Waiting Period,3516,"Many people view the mandatory, pre-abortion 48-hour waiting period as a pointless inconvenience at best and a thinly disguised attempt by your state government to legislate religious practices that restrict women’s bodily autonomy at worst. Either way, that’s super negative of them! Instead, look at this 48-hour period as a chance to get away from it all for some much-needed me-time! Here are some great weekend getaways that will take your mind off of being in reproductive purgatory so you can focus on having some pre-abortion fun in the sun!   1. Go on a relaxing meditation retreat. Before you terminate your pregnancy, go terminate your negative spiritual energy at a relaxing meditation retreat! The government may have ever-increasing control over your womb, but only you control your consciousness. After a weekend of cross-legged bliss, you’ll realize that you are your own greatest obstacle to inner peace. Well, besides your state legislature, and your lousy health insurance, and the mob of pro-life demonstrators gearing up to scream, “Baby Killer!” at you on Monday. But mostly, just you. Om, baby, om!   2. Buy a two-day pass to Disney World. This beloved, lethally overcrowded amusement park is the perfect place to contemplate the staggering population growth expected to overtake our planet in the coming generations while watching beautiful, virginal princesses sing about longing. As you get lost in the throngs of unhappy parents and their crying children, you may start to wonder why your state legislature has such an invasively vested interest in seeing you add to the crowd. That’s probably just your hysterical womb talking, though. Go and give that man in a Mickey Mouse costume a hug like a normal American.   3. Take a quaint excursion to Colonial Williamsburg. Wile away those agonizing 48 hours in the quaint world of Colonial Williamsburg. You’ll find yourself instantly transported to a time when men were men, and women hand-churned butter throughout each of their nine pregnancies. Suddenly, all the encroaching state restrictions on your womb won’t feel quite so repressive. Ah, womanhood: a historical journey from very sucky to less sucky, with a few state-imposed detours along the way!     4. Hit up a nude beach resort. Your body may be a battleground in our country’s cultural wars, but that shouldn’t stop you from indulging in the sheer, naturalistic freedom of a nude beach resort! Soak up some rays and watch your tan lines fade away—just in time to for that legally mandated vaginal ultrasound! You Sun Goddess, you! Need a steamy beach read? Why not try your state’s sprawling informed consent packet?   5. Go hunting and wonder why the Jesus freaks don’t have a problem with people killing inedible animals purely for sadistic pride. Spend the weekend in a wilderness hunting retreat, killing some innocent, preferably inedible creatures for the sheer brutal thrill of it. As you surround yourself with mindless slaughter, you may begin to wonder why America treats a three-week-old fetus as more alive than, say, the majestic mother doe you’ve just felled. Bond with one of your fellow hunters by jokingly pointing out that if guys could get pregnant, abortion would be even easier to access than any of his five personal guns—without a background check!   Remember, your abortion waiting period is what you make of it. So don’t let the fact that a bunch of elderly men get to make all the rules about your reproductive healthcare get in the way of a good time!","Jul 3, 2015"
"Actually, I’m an Intersectional Men’s Rights Activist",2676,"Identity politics are complicated. It can be easy for us to blithely ignore issues of race, class, ability, gender identity, and immigration status. I’m not afraid to say that I think beyond the basic tenets of Men’s Rights Activism that ignore the many complicated facets of privilege. That’s why I’m an intersectional MRA.   For me, the MRA movement lives or dies on whether or not it includes misogynists of all stripes. I’m vocal about the perils of men of every race, class, and gender (as long as that gender is “dude”). If we are going to succeed in toppling our boob-laden oppressors, it’s going to take all of our fedoras united as one. It’s not about straight white MRAs being nice to MRAOCs. We must work to undo the lies we’ve been told about nonconforming woman-haters in order to beat every level of this game.   No experience of oppression can be fully understood until we consider the consequences of race, class, and just one gender (a “cool-ass dude”). There’s room in this movement for all of us. It doesn’t matter if you’re straight, queer, or anything in between; you have just as much right to fight against those conniving women who are constantly trying to accuse you of rape just because you like them.     We all know that men have shorter lifespans than women because their wombs give preferential treatment to girl babies. However, unlike other MRAs, I acknowledge that different men have different lifespans based on a number of factors, such as access to healthcare, past jail time, and dick size. We cannot allow de facto exclusion to keep us from telling women what they should do.   No; I don’t believe you should ascribe to the gender binary. As long as you’re a man.   No matter what your skin color or ethnic heritage, you have just as much right to talk about how attractive women oppress you.   It doesn’t matter if you are differently abled; you have the right to tell women to shut up on Twitter. Because you are a man, and that’s your right.   Now let’s talk about privilege. Female privilege is real and it affects men of all races, classes, and gender (“cool-ass dude who loves Buffalo Wild Wings”). Women get to sit on the bus when they’re pregnant. They get to keep and raise their kids all by themselves with no spousal support. They get to choose between career and family life. They get to pursue men their whole lives. Haven’t they had it too good for too long?   Let me put it this way: There’s no Susan G. Komen Race for Men’s Ass Cancer. If we want our sons to be raised in a world free of men’s ass cancer, it’s going to take all colors, shapes, and sizes of dude-bro.   Also, patriarchy is just like periods: a total myth.","Mar 2, 2015"
"Practical Stocking Stuffers That Say, ‘This Relationship Has Peaked’",2659,"Does your relationship still have that “spark,” or are you just two dimly lit energy-saving spiral bulbs moving through space? The only way to know for sure is through the critical analysis of your stocking stuffers. Here are some super-practical little gifts that say, “I’m just in this until the holidays are over.”   Socks  Everyone knows that for any Christmas as an adult, socks are always the best gifts. From your mom or your little brother, socks say, “I know you need these.” From a significant other, though? They say, “I don’t even know who you are anymore.” There are ways this can be avoided – If the socks are of the lacy thigh-high, your relationship still has a chance. If you’re giving or receiving a pack of white ankle-length footwear staples, though—the sexy ship has sailed. Give up before you reach the slipper phase and can’t remember what sex feels like.    Floss What used to be a cute reminder that you’re looking out for dental hygiene is now a “I’m tired of kissing a bacteria-infested cavern of nicotine residue and popcorn kernels.” If your man’s mouth looks like the bloody battle of Antietam after the dentist, this stocking stuffer is a surefire way to send the message that your relationship is more of a codependent healthcare routine at this point.   A Discounted Paperback How To Win Friends and Influence People or How to Bow Out of This Relationship Before We Morph Into Blood Relatives? An almost best-selling memoir you picked up at Wal-Mart lets your loved one know their life needs major improvement and you’d rather they fix it through some generic advice and not your waning support.   Dandruff Shampoo Sure, you can try to pass it off as that you just want him to be able to wear black shirts again but everyone will know that those snowflakes you drew on his face on the card aren’t as subtle as you intended.     Clinical-Strength Deodorant  ‘Tis the season for all things spiced—including some sexy prescription-strength deodorant. Replenishing your partner’s supply is one thing, but acknowledging his undiagnosed perspiration disorder? Shit’s peaked. If you find a 48-hour lasting clinical strength overnight deodorant in your stocking, you’re lucky if your relationship lasts as long as that suspiciously powerful stick of antiperspirant.   Breathe-right Strips Breathe-right Strips are the passive aggressor’s method of shouting: “I’m this close to sleeping in separate rooms.” Quit while you still have your hearing.   If you find yourself getting these gifts, you might want to ask yourself, “Do I actually have a future with this man?” Get sweet stuff or this relationship can get stuffed, right ladies?","Dec 4, 2014"
Defend Your Reproductive Rights Without Seeming Too Pushy,2905,"It’s time to face the ugly truth: You have a uterus. And due to the results of the recent midterm election, the fetus that could occupy that uterus may currently have more rights than you do. But never fear! There is a way for you to defend your reproductive rights without coming off as just another pushy chick overwhelmed by hormones. Here’s how:   Suggest, but don’t demand. Feel free to ask for what you want, but don’t claim that you “deserve” anything. At the end of the day, your elected officials know best. If they don’t, then why did you elect them? Oh, you didn’t vote? Welp.   Don’t use gross words like “vagina” or “fetus.” Scientific terms have no place in politics or anywhere. Words like “vagina” or “uterus” or “my body” can be a real turn-off for policy makers. Try substituting with “the down-below fun hole,” “potential baby nest,” and “the vessel I inhabit, which I’d like to make decisions for, you know, if it’s not too much to ask.” When discussing the rights of a “fetus,” avoid both the pro-choice term “collection of cells” and the pro-right term “unborn baby,” and instead try the more politically correct “baby cells.”     Know how to “play the game.” Sometimes your lawmakers like to play hard to get! They’re not going to give up all your rights at once just because you buy them dinner; you have to seduce them over time, with wine, chocolates, and campaign donations. But it doesn’t all have to seem like business; you can make it fun, too! Try spicing it up with the “you show me yours, I’ll show you mine game,” where “yours” is affordable birth control, and “mine” is “my ‘well it’s about damn time’ face.”   Don’t ask for too much at once. The easiest way to come off as pushy is to demand all of your rights at the same time. Try starting slow, with access to affordable birth control before also asking for medical care and the right to decide what to do with the contents of your own uterus. And remember: you win some, you lose some! For every five rights you gain, expect three rights you already had to be taken away. It’s all part of the fun!   When you say “no,” don’t really mean it. When you say, “No, I don’t want you to make my healthcare decisions for me,” expect your lawmakers to hear, “Come on in, boys, the legs are open!” After all, sometimes “no” does mean “yes,” if you know how to spot it. And some congressmen sure do know how to spot it! Politicians know that compromise is important, so if you say “no,” and they hear “yes,” settling on a solid, “maybe you should just trust us to make decisions for you” is a way for both sides to win!   Follow these tips, and you’re sure to maybe possibly get some of your reproductive rights back for a little bit. The mostly important thing is that you seem cool, calm, and collected no matter what. Because remember: the only time your vagina should seem pushy is when it is literally pushing out a baby.","Nov 20, 2014"
The Six Best Colleges for Not Getting Raped,3953,"A recent U.S. News & World Report survey of female high school seniors shows a spike in demand for safer college campuses with a low risk of sexual assault. “The results are clear,” says guidance counselor Mallory Elmore. “The trend we’re seeing for 2015 is a high demand for not being raped.”   Over 90% of survey participants indicated that their first-choice college must have strong extracurricular options, a good teacher-to-student ratio, and not-rape. In fact, when polled about whether they prefer “rape” or “not rape,” most prospective college students strongly favored “not rape.” So, we’ve compiled our own list of schools for rising seniors of the six best colleges for not getting raped:   6. Geusen College – Hologram Campus If you’re looking for a small women’s liberal arts college, you won’t find this one, because it is hidden by a series of state-of-the-art holograms, specifically designed to confuse and disorient the male brain. Located in an undisclosed location in the Northern Hemisphere, this isolated 40-acre campus is rumored to be extremely beautiful. We say, “rumored” because their website redirects to a splash page with a photo of a dove clutching a gun. Classes start every eight weeks.   5. Miss Price School for Girls Although it is technically a finishing school for little girls, the Miss Price School for Girls is a great choice for any grad who would prefer not to be raped at school. They offer degree programs in Silverware Placement, Playing Nice, and Curtsying. Campus security (a butler named Teddysworth) reports the school has had only one sexual assault on campus, and that “Bumbly Bear has not been asked back after he reportedly touched Dolly’s no-no.” Rolling admissions are available through August 1st.   4. Shrimms College of Queens, NY Run by three middle-aged women who “don’t take no sh*t from nobody,” Shrimms has a no-rape feel while the big, rape-y city is just minutes away. Choose from over seven majors, including Yelling, Purse Item Weaponry, and Overzealous Police Officer Management. If you’ve ever taken a women’s self defense class at a dojo in Queens, you may be able to transfer credits. Four years here will have you well prepared for the statistically rare occurrence of stranger rape. Apply online.     3. Shira Uni-her-sity Though not a traditional university, Shira Uni-her-sity’s four-week chakra workshop can be transferred to almost any college that acknowledges Mother Gaia. The atypical campus is a lovely living room of two culturally Jewish sextagenarian lesbians named Hannah. You can major in Sometimes Vegan or Half-Assed Crafting, with minors in All-Caps Emails and Litter Scooping. Requires SAT, ACT, or a beautiful Warrior 2.   2. Duggar University While not an accredited university, the frustratingly nice stars of TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting” are experienced homeschoolers who have probably never raped anyone. You’ll save money on books, since there’s only one Good Book on your materials list. Ride the complimentary school bus to campus, where you can enroll in courses like Barrel Curls 101, Intro to Raising Younger Siblings, and Courting. Duggar University boasts a competitive 19:1 teacher to student ratio. With the friendly communal spirit (and ubiquitous TV cameras), there’s nearly no chance of getting assaulted. Open admissions until show is cancelled.   1. DeVry University What better way to prevent rape than to never leave your house? Online universities like DeVry offer students the luxury of choosing class times that work around your “clutching-hammer-while-peeking-through-blinds” schedule. The full report of all violent crimes at DeVry boasts an impressive “N/A” for sexual assault. You can get your associate degree in accounting, bachelor’s in healthcare management, or even your master’s in education, all while isolating yourself from a world that tacitly cheers on the wholesale objectification of half its inhabitants. Apply online.","Jul 7, 2014"
Apple Releases the iPhone 36b for Breast Cancer Awareness Month,1908,"Just in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Apple announced its plans to release the iPhone 36b this week. “The 36b embodies the same elegance as the 5c, but with added functionality to keep you extremely aware of breast cancer,” Tim Cook said. With a playful nod to September’s 5c announcement, he chuckled, “It’s beautifully, unapologetically pink.”
 
While the 5c is already available in pink, the 36b’s sleek exterior will come in Breast Cancer Pink, complimented by matching wallpaper, allowing for users to experience a “seamless awareness of breast cancer, even when the phone is off.” Apple is also manufacturing covers in Breast Cancer Magenta to mimic the shadowed sides of the cause’s emblematic ribbon.
 
With a built-in “Pinkscale” filter, the 36b automatically converts your photos from full color into different shades of pink. It also boasts Lapel Identification, which automatically identifies subjects’ chest areas and places a breast cancer ribbon on each. Small touches like this give this phone an unparalleled awareness of breast cancer.
 
In addition to the free built-in apps like Passbook and Stocks, the 36c will feature two new exclusive apps:
 
iMamm
Utilizing the latest in digital healthcare, iMamm allows users to give each other mammograms by squishing their breasts between two iPhones. “Users finally have the ability to perform mammograms on the go. How cool is that?” said Cook. The reliability of this feature has yet to be proven and is currently being marketed “for entertainment purposes only.”
 
Breasts!
This app allows women to share pictures of their breasts, pre and post-op, through a secure network of verifiably female cancer survivors.
 
In typical Apple fashion, the announcement left the audience with a lingering question: are any proceeds actually going to a charity? As it turns out, rates vary by carrier as they are based on individual phone plans.","Oct 3, 2013"
