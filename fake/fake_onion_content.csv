Apologetic Nurse Informs Man Having Heart Attack There’s About An Hour Wait Until Next Covid Patient Dies,8/26/21,1078,"GAINESVILLE, FL—Promising to let him know as soon as something becomes available, nurse Janae Howager informed a man having a heart attack Thursday that there was about an hour wait until the next Covid-19 patient died. “Sorry, we just had a couple large groups of infected people come in, so it could be anywhere from an hour to a couple days depending on how long they can hold on,” said Howager, revealing that something would definitely open up due to the virus’s high fatality rate, adding that he was more than welcome to sit in the lobby and have some complementary aspirin to keep his blood from clotting until it does. “If you can’t wait, there are a few other hospitals in the area that you can try, but most places have overbooked their ICUs. Now, there are just a couple of people who were in a car accident and a gunshot victim ahead of you, but a few of our Covid patients’ oxygen levels are pretty low, so there could be a quick turnaround.” At press time, Howager was wheeling the man’s gurney into the emergency room early after someone died ahead of schedule.

"‘Rise Up, Patriots!’ Rand Paul Calls To Intubated Patients Lying Unconscious In Hospital ICU",8/10/21,1183,"WASHINGTON—Rallying patients lying unconscious in the intensive care unit of George Washington University Hospital, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) called on those intubated due to Covid-19 to rise up from their hospital beds and choose freedom, sources confirmed Tuesday. “To all you brave patriots who have been imprisoned in this ICU, I say join me and your fellow countrymen in rebelling against this despotic medical system!” shouted Paul, a non-board-certified ophthalmologist who represents a state in which more than 1,000 people are hospitalized with Covid, before going on to urge every patient with acute respiratory failure to join arm-in-arm and cast off the tyrannical yoke of fear and propaganda. “Don’t you see? Those ventilators aren’t there to save you, they’re meant to enslave you. They may look like innocent, artificial breathing devices intended to provide you with you a steady supply of oxygen, but they are the shackles of your oppressor. Rip out your breathing tube and join the resistance!” At press time, dozens of Covid patients had reportedly died after Paul attempted to reenact the Boston Tea Party by dumping their discolored, hypoxic bodies into the Potomac."

"‘I’ll Wait Until It Passes The CDC, DCC, CCD, FAD, AFD, FDA, BIA, AIB, BFI, FIB, FBI,’ Announces Vaccine Skeptic",8/09/21,1509,"CANTON, MS—Calling the likely FDA approval of the Covid-19 vaccine an important first step, local vaccine skeptic Martin Graham announced Monday that he still would not be receiving a jab “until it passes the CDC, DCC, CCD, FAD, AFD, FDA, BIA, AIB, BFI, FIB, FBI” and all other combinations of three letters to better ensure that what’s in it is truly safe. “The CDC wants you to believe that they have all the answers, but I’m curious as to what the DCC, AUD, and IUD have to say as well,” said Graham, 53, adding that if the FCS, XQJ, or SUV were also set to rule on the safety and effectiveness of the inoculations this week, “then that would be a whole different story.” “I’m tired of everyone taking the WHO and FDA at their word, when we aren’t seeing the research carried out by, say, the MLS—let alone agencies we know and trust like the MLB, NBA, NHL, or NFL. For instance, what does the head of the CSI think of it? Is it even on their radar yet? I tell you what—give me a call when the CIA, CSI, MLM, CCC, DDD, DDS, BIB, NIB, LIN, WQH, XYZ, PPE, SAM, HAT, LLC, LOL, FIG, SNI, SNL, MOM, CVC, FMS, XMI, LAN, NLA, SAU, FSU, OMG, GMO, ENL, WUI, ZZZ, CFO, KLO, PQR, GNC, DND, JHJ, STD, BUB, WEL, VIV, NIN, VHS, RFT, DOC, PDF, HUM, SKO, HIU, UUT, FML, DRB, CCT, MEK, BIL, UTW, and the GMT all grant their blessing, and I’ll run out and get the shot as fast as you can say TTV.” At press time, Graham dutifully crossed out the FDA from his master list of 17,576 organizations he was waiting to hear from.

"Man Hides Under Bed, Covers Mouth As Enormous Delta Variant Virus Tears Through House",8/05/21,970,"JACKSONVILLE, FL—Awaking with a jolt to the sound of the enraged virus rampaging around his kitchen, local man Chris Turner reportedly hid under his bed and covered his mouth in terror Thursday as an enormous Delta coronavirus variant tore through his house. “Please, God, I’ll do anything, just make this mutation go away,” whispered a panicked Turner, who held his breath beneath his bed frame and watched helplessly as the gargantuan virus ripped through his belongings, tearing shelves out of his closet and throwing his dresser against the wall before pausing over his mattress and using its five-inch-long spike proteins to sniff for blood. “Don’t panic, don’t panic. Maybe if I just stay very quiet, it will think I’m dead. Plus, I’m young and healthy. It might not even want anything to do with me. Oh God.” At press time, Turner had pulled out his phone to contact the Centers for Disease Control, only to gasp in terror when the device began loudly vibrating.

Bored Vaccination Worker Spends Afternoon With No Patients Stabbing Syringe Between Fingers,7/29/21,1196,"HUNTSVILLE, AL—In an effort to make it through a long day with nothing to do, bored vaccination worker Ray Gately told reporters Thursday he had spent an afternoon with no patients stabbing a syringe back and forth between his splayed-out fingers. “With no vaccine appointments all day, I’ve actually gotten pretty good at putting my outstretched hand on this table and seeing how fast I can slam down a hypodermic needle without piercing my flesh,” said the local 33-year-old, listening to a podcast as he tried, once again, to break his personal record for “the ol’ five-finger fillet” with a syringe full of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine. “Almost no one comes in here, so we’re constantly looking for new ways to kill time. When we got tired of using the surplus doses to give each other booster shots, we started playing darts with the syringes. But after a couple months, you get to where you can hit the bull’s-eye every time, and it gets pretty dull. You know what? I’m gonna try this left-handed.” At press time, a yawning Gately was seen putting the finishing touches on a detailed scale model of the Taj Mahal constructed entirely of unopened, expired vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine."
CDC Director Alarmed After Googling ‘Covid Cases’ For First Time in Weeks,7/28/21,867,"ATLANTA—Admitting that she was caught off guard by the resurgent threat, CDC director Rochelle Wolensky expressed alarm Wednesday after Googling “Covid cases” for the first time in weeks. “Holy shit, I haven’t been checking in on the coronavirus because I thought we’d turned a corner, but damn, this looks really bad,” said Wolensky, holding up her phone for the press to show the rapidly escalating graphs of caseloads and deaths displayed on the search engine before asking if anyone else had seen this. “And the more I’m looking at this, does the Johnson & Johnson one have a different effect on the delta variant than the mRNA ones? Jesus, I see why I’ve been avoiding it now. This is just super depressing.” Wolensky added that she would probably ignore hospitalization data for the next month and hope things leveled off before her upcoming vacation to Hawaii."
How Organizers Plan To Keep The Tokyo Olympics Safe,7/21/21,3819,"All athletes will be required to thoroughly wash their hands once before attending the games. Just the gold ones. If they really cared about their health, the silver and bronze winners should have tried harder. Gymnasts will be asked to present vaccination documentation before their feet will be permitted to make contact with the mat. The 15-foot-deep pool will be used to store the thousands of saliva samples gathered every day for Covid testing, though the pool will still be used in competition. Nobody come, let’s just call it a 200-way tie. Slipping one of these padded, nylon muscle suits onto every Olympian before their events will prevent skin-to-skin contact while still allowing viewers to get an idea of the impressive athletic physiques that lie below. Tokyo police have strategically placed marksmen around the city with orders of “shoot to kill” when they spot anyone exhibiting Covid symptoms. This measure alone could reduce the Covid risk by 50%. A 6-foot gap will prevent these athletes from grappling, forcing them to swing their arms wildly in an effort to pin their opponents with air currents. To dissuade athletes from interacting with one another, each will be given nearly four gigabytes of MP4 videos of gangbangs, orgies, and fuckfests in either live action or hentai form. Medalists representing countries with an immunization rate below 50% will be forced to stand in shameful silence and think about how their homeland has failed. While ultimately useless in convincing attendees to stay “one dolphin apart,” “four dancing penguins apart,” or “3.5 armadillos apart,” these complete wastes of single-use plastic will humorlessly take up every square inch of wallspace in the Tokyo metropolitan area. While the balls may end up shriveled and no longer buoyant, they’ll be completely free of germs. Following the success of eradicating germs in the water polo, swimming, and diving arenas, officials have opted to fill complimentary Gatorade coolers with the powerful disinfectant and place them around the Olympic grounds for wide-scale dousing. Good job, guys! In order to keep everyone safe, events will be operating at 30% capacity to allow for social distancing. Athletes must reserve their spot the morning of the competition with a credit card on file. Although it’s one of the games’ most beloved events, the organizers decided it was just too dangerous this year. Athletes will eat in carefully controlled cafeterias and will no longer be able to line up for all-you-can-eat roast beef and fried shrimp alongside the outermost lane. The Tokyo Olympics Committee has hired a stern German nurse who will be in charge of going around making sure everyone adheres to the health protocols. Athletic events including gymnastics, swimming, diving, and marathon running will feature several doctors competing as athletes in order to keep tabs on potentially contagious individuals. All javelins will be replaced with 8-foot nose swabs and aimed at volunteers who have potentially been exposed to the novel coronavirus. We’re talking wiping down surfaces, small air filtration devices, spraying things with disinfectant—you know, all the stuff that doesn’t really move the needle, safety-wise. By banning all athletes from attending and simply hosting an empty stadium without anything happening in it for several years, Tokyo organizers have ensured virtually no chance of coronavirus transmission.

Knee To Hurt For Rest Of Life After 30-Year-Old Woman Sits Awkwardly For 2 Minutes,6/08/21,933,"SAVANNAH, GA—Completely oblivious of the implications of her body’s positioning, Rebecca Branagan, 30, reportedly began a lifetime of chronic knee pain by sitting awkwardly for two minutes Tuesday. According to sources, Branagan’s slight five millimeter shift of bodyweight while her knee was folded oddly underneath her for a little over a minute caused irreparable damage to the ligaments that would plague her for the next four or five decades. Several reports confirmed that the suffering triggered by the brief unnatural positioning that would force her to try multiple pain medications to alleviate the agonizing spasms she would get from the moment she woke up until she went to sleep at night would never go away and more likely only worsen until the day she died. At press time, Branagan had stood up from the weird position and started stretching and shaking out her legs to get the strange feeling in her knee to go away.

Coronavirus Variant Excited To Compete With World’s Top Mutations In Tokyo This Summer,5/27/21,1030,"LONDON—Having prepared for months to make its mark at this year’s Olympics, coronavirus variant B.1.525—a U.K. native best known for its skillful weakening of antibody responses—confirmed Thursday that it was excited to compete in Tokyo against top mutations from across the globe. “I can’t wait to travel to Japan this July and show the whole world what I’m capable of,” said the highly transmissible permutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, recounting how it had honed its spike proteins and vaccine resistance in anticipation of the international gathering of deadly pathogens. “I know South Africa, Brazil, and India will be bringing the heat, but I’m planning to have a big breakout moment myself. And if I’m not a household name by the closing ceremonies, well, there’s always the 2021 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally later in the summer.” Olympic bookmakers, observing that the United States is overdue to produce a highly lethal mutation, are reported to have the young California variants B.1.427 and B.1.429 favored in the spread.

New Program Encourages Americans To Get Vaccine To Prevent It From Going To Foreigners,5/12/21,1129,"WASHINGTON—In an attempt to address persistent hesitancy about being inoculated, the White House announced a new campaign Wednesday encouraging Americans to get a vaccine to prevent it from going to foreigners. “What we’re hoping Americans understand is that every shot they receive for the coronavirus not only protects them, but also ensures that an impoverished man or woman in another country will be that much further away from getting their own protection,” said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, describing the nationwide campaign of TV spots, magazine ads, and billboards depicting a broadly smiling American receiving their shot contrasted against a openly weeping person from India or Kenya. “We’ve found that many Americans might not get a vaccine for their family or community, but they absolutely will if it means, say, a Paraguayan man has to watch his Covid-ravaged grandfather expire from an acute respiratory illness. Frankly, we just wish we’d stumbled on this strategy earlier.” At press time, the White House proudly announced that vaccine hesitancy had dropped 87% moments after launching the campaign.

Mother Assures Daughter It Perfectly Natural To Spray Geyser Of Period Blood All Over Classroom,5/07/21,1129,"COLUMBUS, OH—Stressing that the powerful jet of red fluid emitting from her genitals was nothing to be embarrassed about, local mother Stephanie Reese assured her daughter Friday that it was perfectly natural to spray a geyser of period blood all over the classroom. “Honey, I know it can feel so humiliating the first time your period shoots out of you, knocking you backwards 30 feet and spraying everyone in the classroom with gallons upon gallons of blood, but it happens to everyone, I promise,” said Reese, adding that if anyone had a problem with it, they should just “grow up.” “I remember when I was your age and I was in gym class, and suddenly, 300 psi worth of menstrual blood came spewing out of me like a fire hose, sending me and everyone around me slipping and sliding every which way. Honestly, I feel like if we could openly talk about how sometimes heavy periods can blast a hole through a 9-inch-thick concrete wall, the whole thing would be less taboo.” At press time, Reese handed her daughter her first tampon, but told her to be careful not to let the pressure build up too much or else she would explode."

Or that time in my 20s when I thought my friends were just having a picnic but it turned out to be hiking. It’s almost like there’s a little bit of a burn going on in there, and I have to say, I really don’t care for it. Sometimes my limbs fall asleep when I stay on the couch too long, but this is worse. I guess I really overdid it today.” At press time, Broderman announced that he would be taking it easy for the next three weeks to make sure he was rested and ready to receive the vaccine’s second dose."

CDC Announces It Kind Of Embarrassing To Get Coronavirus This Late In Pandemic,3/31/21,1168,"ATLANTA—Stressing that no normal person would even do such a thing at this stage in the ongoing crisis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that, frankly, it was kind of embarrassing to get coronavirus this late in the pandemic. “Honestly, we’re far past the point where it wouldn’t be awkward and just sort of baffling for someone to contract Covid-19,” said CDC director Rochelle Walansky, adding that it might have made sense to get the coronavirus several months ago when more people were in hospitals or recovering at home, but that it really raised questions about where you were as a human being to be this far behind the curve. “Look, if you had come to me last year in the summer or even fall and said ‘I can’t smell anything—what should I do?’ I would have understood. But now? It just makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with you. I’m not trying to mean here. But at this point, even among medical professionals, it’s humiliating for them to treat you. Don’t make them do that.” Walansky added that it was especially mortifying for an American to get coronavirus because the CDC had specifically asked them not to do that.

CDC Concludes U.S. Not Prepared For Potential Pandemic Following Year-Long Simulation Drill,3/30/21,1208,"WASHINGTON—Concluding that almost every aspect of the country’s response had been a “complete and utter failure,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday that the U.S. was not prepared for a potential pandemic following a year-long simulation drill. “Over the past 12 months, we’ve seen everything from the healthcare system, to the education system, to the food supply chain become strained, and in some cases, collapse beneath the weight of what was just a simple test,” said head of the CDC Dr. Rochelle Walensky, adding that the exhaustive Covid-19 simulation, which was launched in the United States in March 2020, had earned the country a resoundingly low F rating in pandemic readiness. “Unfortunately, if a real viral disease began infecting the U.S. population, we’d have seen absolutely devastating results ending in millions more deaths, as well as complete economic devastation. Based on these less-than-satisfactory numbers, we cannot definitively say the U.S. could ever test, vaccinate, or recover its population from any type of pandemic.” At press time, the National Weather Service also concluded that the U.S. had failed its decades-long global warming simulation."
CDC Places Star Stickers On Bulletin Board Next To Names Of Americans Who Followed Rules Whole Pandemic,3/24/21,1394,"ATLANTA—In an effort to better enforce Covid-19 guidelines, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reportedly placing star stickers on a bulletin board Wednesday next to the names of Americans who had followed the rules through the whole pandemic thus far. “We wanted to recognize all the good and responsible Americans who have been doing their part this year by wearing a mask and practicing proper social distancing—great job, everybody, and well done!” said CDC director Rochelle Walensky, who unpeeled a fresh gold foil star from the sheet of stickers in her hand to reward 43-year-old Sacramento resident Sam Wright for his recent decision to take his restaurant order to go. “You’ll notice there are some silver stars on the board as well, indicating when someone went to the grocery store or got too close to a stranger, but as long as you didn’t do that more than two days in a row, you’ll still earn a gold star. If you haven’t flown on an airplane or dined indoors since February 2020, excellent work. Your family and friends will be so proud to see all your stars! Plus, Americans who have accumulated five gold stars by the end of the pandemic will receive a very special treat.” At press time, Walensky added that the CDC had placed metallic cross stickers next to the names of Americans who had followed all of the rules but died of coronavirus anyway.

I remember talking to some other senators, and we were all frantically trying to research the tech companies that were best positioned to increase their value off of all the lifestyle changes we found out were coming.” Burr added he was just thankful that the nation’s medical experts impressed on him just how serious the pandemic would be back in February 2020."

CDC Guidelines Allow Fully Vaccinated People To Gather Indoors With Curtains Drawn To Reduce Spread Of Jealousy,3/10/21,1064,"ATLANTA—Reminding Americans that the pandemic was still far from over, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines Wednesday allowing fully vaccinated people to gather indoors with the curtains drawn to reduce the spread of jealousy. “If we don’t stop the spread of envy, it could soon turn into full-blown rage, so please be sure those drapes completely cover the windows,” said CDC director Rochelle Walensky, who called upon the 10% of Americans who had already received their first and second vaccination doses to do their part and keep their cocktail parties, family gatherings, and other social events discreet. “To nip FOMO in the bud, we must act fast, and we must act together. As an added precaution, we also recommend turning off the lights. Draping blankets over yourselves works, too, if you’re really in a pinch.” At press time, Walensky added that in the case a fully vaccinated person ran into a non-vaccinated person, they were strongly advised to lie through their teeth and tell them it was still the same old, same old.

CDC Launches Ad Campaign Featuring Racist Mascot In Effort To Get More Conservatives Vaccinated,3/09/21,1168,"ATLANTA—Targeting the series of PSAs towards communities that were skeptical of inoculation, the Centers For Disease Control launched a new ad campaign Tuesday featuring a racially offensive animated mascot in an effort to get more conservatives vaccinated. “We’re hopeful that associating the vaccine with this outmoded and reprehensible caricature will help give right-wing Americans some comfort and familiarity and increase their likelihood of signing up,” said Director Rochelle Walensky, confirming that the mascot, whose design was based largely on World War II propaganda imagery, would speak in an offensively broad accent to continuously spout racial catchphrases completely unacceptable to modern sensibilities. “Our goal is to provoke a massive public pressure campaign which forces us to remove this hateful mascot, leading conservatives to locate as many vaccines as possible lest the country lose an important part of its heritage to cancel culture and the woke mob.” Walensky added that the CDC also hoped to discourage travel amongst conservatives by claiming without evidence that Delta Airlines gives discounted rates to Planned Parenthood members.

Researchers Warn Of New Giant Covid-19 Variant Large Enough To Swallow Grown Man Whole,3/04/21,1396,"ATLANTA—Urging Americans to reconsider their current precautions in light of the grim discovery, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers warned Thursday of a new giant Covid-19 variant large enough to swallow a grown man whole. “This is a mammoth monster of a virus, big enough and strong enough to consume a full-sized adult male in one swift gulp,” said CDC director Rochelle Walensky, adding that the first confirmed victim of the A.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant was a man in El Paso, Texas of whom nothing was left but his shoes. “What we’ve got on our hands is a virus that stalks the shadows and can lift a grown adult in its two protein envelope jaws. It strikes at night, when the moon is just a sliver in the sky, and is transmitted through the air so fast that you’ll never even know what hit you. In an instant, its membrane will have wrapped around your throat, and everything will go black. We advise all Americans to maintain a wide berth from poorly lit areas, to not turn corners quickly, and if you hear a rustling sound behind you, our expert advice is to start saying your prayers.” The report recommended that anyone who believed they had come into contact with someone infected by this new Covid-19 variant should immediately drive as far as they could into a remote area and under no circumstances bring the massive, man-eating variant beast anywhere near a hospital.

CDC Warns About More Deadly Covid Variants After Virus Mutates Into Serial Killer Richard Ramirez,1/26/21,1189,"ATLANTA—Urging the nation’s populace to remain vigilant against the lethal pathogen, the Centers for Disease Control held a press conference Tuesday to warn of an even more deadly Covid variant after the virus mutated into notorious serial killer Richard Ramirez. “In an effort to avoid this virus, we are asking all Americans to remain at home with the door locked, and we recommend cities continue to implement curfews, as our data indicate this new variant often strikes at night,” said CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, stressing that Americans should avoid social gatherings as the cruel, remorseless virus was capable of moving undetected through large groups of people. “We believe that the virus is currently speeding up the California coast, with the possibility of traveling much further. Be on the lookout for common symptoms such as bloody tire irons and Satanic pentagrams. If you believe you may have seen this Covid variant in your community, please immediately contact the authorities.” At press time, Walensky urged Americans to steel themselves for additional Covid variants after getting early reports of a Zodiac Killer mutation which was almost impossible to trace.

CDC Announces Country On Track To Chuck 1 Million Expired Vaccines Per Day,1/25/21,1129,"ATLANTA—Stressing the challenge of overcoming numerous obstacles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that the United States was finally on track to chuck out 1 million expired vaccines per day. “After spending months struggling with the vaccine rollout, we at the CDC are proud to announce that, come February, the U.S. will finally be meeting our goal of shit-canning one million doses a day,” said Rochelle Walensky, director of the Center, explaining how, thanks to the help of the federal government, drug manufacturers have greatly ramped up production and distribution of the inoculation so it can now be tossed out with maximum speed and efficiency. “When we announced our goal, it may have seemed overly ambitious, but thanks to poor coordination and funding cuts among state and local entities, we were able to make what seemed like a moonshot into reality. This moment is a major milestone in the fight against Covid that will be remembered for generations to come.” Walensky added that if they keep their current pace, the U.S.’s entire vaccine stockpile could be in the garbage by summer."

Public Health Experts Claim It’s Safe To Reopen Weird Little Private Schools Where They Have Class In Barn,9/09/20,1301,"ATLANTA—Claiming that the health risks from the novel coronavirus were relatively minor, public health experts announced Wednesday that, given proper precautions, it was safe for students to return to those weird little private schools where they have class in a barn. “Our research has indicated that the school year should be able to resume without incident in tiny educational facilities where there are only like 15 students to begin with and most of them are related anyway,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, telling reporters that a largely outdoor curriculum consisting of digging in a community garden and dancing around a Maypole presented a low likelihood of transmission. “Of course, administrators will still need to make sure everyone is maintaining proper social distancing while milking the school goat, and students should be required to always wear the macramé masks they made in what passes for their version of a science class. If we’re able to stick to these guidelines, enrollees should be able to dance and cavort around in the woods like a normal school year.” Redfield cautioned that weird little private schools should still avoid higher risk activities such as gathering together in a guitar circle to sing a medley of Simon & Garfunkel songs until at least next semester.

Man Unaware Majority Of His Life’s Failures Directly Caused By Getting Only 80% Daily Recommended Thiamine,7/21/20,1165,"LANSING, MI—Confirming the man’s utter obliviousness to the root of all his problems, 44-year-old Eric Shoup reportedly remains unaware that the majority of his life’s failures are the direct result of him getting only 80% of his daily recommended thiamine. “If Eric could manage only a couple more servings of brown rice or legumes a day, he’d achieve all of his goals within a year,” said a source close to the man, attributing Shoup’s lack of energy, middling career, and desolate love life to his failure to incorporate even a bit more of B-complex vitamin into his diet. “Eric doesn’t even need to get 100% of the daily recommended dosage. Just 75% would allow him to hold more meaningful conversations with friends and coworkers, while 90% would give him the confidence he needs to pivot into a whole new successful and personally fulfilling career with ease. Unfortunately, he’s never going to figure this out due to his crippling lack of dietary thiamine.” Shoup later came astonishingly close to ingesting his daily recommended level of thiamine by loading up his fork with a large bite of liver, but upon deciding he was full, set the laden utensil down.

Weight Watchers Debuts New Ad Asking If You Remember Time Grandma Said ‘Someone Got Heavy’ In Front Of Everybody,6/16/20,990,"NEW YORK—Harkening back to all those times she used to strongly imply you were fat, Weight Watchers debuted a new television advertisement Tuesday that asks if you recall Grandma saying “My, someone got heavy!” in front of the whole family. “Remember when you arrived home for Thanksgiving and, as soon as she saw you, your grandmother remarked, ‘I can tell at least one of us is ready for dinner,’ while everyone else remained silent and pretended not to hear?” said a voice-over during the commercial, which featured an elderly woman who comments upon the “awfully healthy appetite” of a younger relative enjoying a second helping of mashed potatoes. “Of course you do. It was right before she asked if your weight made it difficult for you to find people to date. Does that jog your memory?” The 30-second spot concluded with an image of the beautiful wedding dress your grandma reportedly wanted to pass down to you but doesn’t think would fit anymore even if you could find a husband.

God Pins Up Hunky Shot Of Mesopotamian Hunting Deity As Inspiration To Start Working Out,4/27/20,1319,"THE HEAVENS—Noting the ancient divine being’s “absolutely killer” abs and pectorals served as the ideal body transformation for Him, The Lord God Almighty pinned up a hunky picture of Mesopotamian hunting deity Ninurta as an inspiration to start working out, heavenly sources confirmed Friday. “Every bicycle crunch I do, I’ll come up and see this shot of Ninurta looking completely ripped, and it just keeps my motor going, y’know?” said He Who Commanded Light To Shine Out Of Darkness, stressing that visualizing Himself with even a fraction of the Mesopotamian’s omnipotence gave Him the self-confidence and dedication needed to really dig in, cut His carb intake, and focus on sculpting His core. “It’s not like I’m ever going to be built enough to be lugging stones around to create the Tigris and Euphrates. But honestly, I’ve never fantasized about being that beefy. Just kind of trim. And whenever I’m wiped from doing farmer’s walk-squat combos around St. Peter’s Gate, I just think about how much those reps probably helped Ninurta chase down the Anzû bird after it stole the Tablet of Destinies. Man, that guy was such a total beast.” At press time, God admitted He was planning the training regime expressly to address the embarrassing weight gain He had experienced from the stress of having His first Son."
10 ‘Healthy’ Foods That Are Actually Bad For You,4/27/20,2125,"You may think that two or three clock radios can easily make up a nutritious meal, but if you keep scarfing down plates of these things you’ll be packing on the pounds in no time. We hate to be the ones who say it, but if you’re going to continue living a healthy life, you need to cut those brooms out of your diet right away! Sure, swallowing a few marker caps every morning is a perfectly healthy breakfast, right? WRONG! Even a small handful of marker caps contains three times your daily caloric intake. Before you eat Berlin for lunch today, remember that at 344 square miles, the German capital could be adding hundreds, if not thousands, of extra calories to your diet. A box of dynamite may have some nutritional value, but overall, it’s probably better to go with an apple, pear, or tire if you want a healthy snack. Words like “vaulted” and “steel-reinforced concrete” have long been mantras of health experts, but if you really want to lower your cholesterol, you’ll want to try your best to skimp on the bank safes in the future. You should only eat six Alan Aldas per day. Health experts have long claimed that a metaphysical-concept-of-fate sandwich is a perfectly healthy lunch item. Well, it turns out the central force maintaining natural order in the universe contains way more sugar than anyone imagined. We’ve all heard that consuming a ream of copier paper is great for your figure, but the science doesn’t lie: Just a single standard 500-count package is the equivalent of eating a whole stick of butter.

British Man Astounded To Hear How Much It Would Cost To Get Mustard Jar Removed From Rectum Under U.S. Healthcare System,3/26/20,1131,"LONDON—Expressing surprise upon learning the high price of the commonplace procedure, local British man Roger Hiddleston was reportedly astounded Friday to hear how much it would cost to extract a mustard jar from his rectum under the United States healthcare system. “When a mate of mine mentioned that it could cost hundreds if not thousands of pounds for something as routine as getting a container of Colman’s mustard out of my sphincter, I was flabbergasted,” said Hiddleston, telling reporters that the statistic was a stark example of the prohibitively high cost of medical care in the U.S. “It’s incredible to think that I could spend a week’s pay for something that would take the doctor less than five minutes to fix. And you know this means there must be countless Americans walking around with mustard jars in their anuses, wincing in pain with every step, and they are completely unable to afford help. It’s a bloody disgrace.” Hiddleston added that with the way things were going with the NHS, he could imagine a future where even in the U.K. he could face a hefty medical bill for stuffing objects into his orifices."
Health Experts Worry Coronavirus Will Overwhelm America’s GoFundMe System,3/13/20,1081,"BALTIMORE—Warning that the nation was unprepared to deal with the fallout of the global pandemic, researchers from Johns Hopkins University told reporters Friday they worried that Covid-19 would overwhelm America’s GoFundMe system. “GoFundMe is the bedrock of the American healthcare system, and as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rapidly spread, we fear the servers just won’t be able to take it,” said research director Dr. Monica White, who stressed that if the pandemic were to grow any worse, there simply would not be enough $5 and $10 donations from sympathetic strangers to go around. “America’s GoFundMe system is already overburdened. There are only so many links from sick friends of friends we can share on social media before the whole thing collapses. We recommend that if anyone is suffering from minor financial strife such a medical debt from the cost of insulin or cancer treatment, you defer to those diagnosed with Covid-19.” At press time, GoFundMe employees announced they were working around the clock to ensure the health and safety of the nation."
Best Methods For Staying Safe From Coronavirus,3/11/20,1719,"Frequently wash your hands with antibacterial soap or sanitizer to ensure the next epidemic-level pathogen has built up an immunity. Make sure any bat or pangolin meat you cook reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit in order to kill all bacteria. Keep calm by remembering that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is working around the clock to find the most profitable vaccine. Become an epidemiologist by earning your doctorate of public health (DrPH). Johns Hopkins has the best program for sure, but also maybe consider applying to Drexel as a safety school? It’s not that we don’t think you’ll get into Hopkins, it’s just, you know, always smart to have options. Philly’s actually supposed to be a pretty cool city. If you believe you’ve contracted the disease, ask your employer about dying-from-home options. Limit the amount of people your germs could potentially spread to by sneezing directly into the mouth of the person nearest to you. Be sure to isolate any sick family members in a separate room to ensure a clean headshot. We hear good things about turmeric, so maybe give that a shot. Remove any infected blood that may be running through your circulatory system. Be vigilant if traveling on a commercial airline. If you believe a passenger may be infected, be prepared to rush the cockpit and crash the plane to save America.

Panicked WHO Officials Not Sure How To Respond After Coronavirus Brings 12 People Back To Life,3/03/20,1303,"GENEVA—Acknowledging they were taken aback by the latest development in the global epidemic, panicked World Health Organization officials were reportedly unsure how to respond Tuesday after the coronavirus brought 12 people back to life. “Uh, okay, so COVID-19 remains a very grave health concern, but we have to admit that the disease returning a dozen people from the dead is a definite upside,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, urging citizens to practice good hygiene in an effort to stop the transmission of the pathogen unless they have recently deceased loved ones, in which case it might make sense to encourage the spread. “If you have recently traveled to an infected area, we urge you to stay quarantined within morgues and graveyards in the hopes that your disease will bring some people back. As a reminder, the elderly and infirm are particularly at risk of coronavirus, so please exercise caution, unless you’re already suffering from a terminal disease in which case, I guess, do your best to contract the virus, maybe? I don’t know, this one’s a real head scratcher.” Adhanom added that a potential response had been further complicated by reports that the 12 afflicted individuals had gained super strength and were capable of running hundreds of miles without getting tired. "

Less chance of attracting elephants. Nothing else in school system to fix. Additional reason to randomly search bags. Janitors don’t have to clean up as many deceased children. Unfair to genetically superior children. Banning peanuts will only make elementary school peanut black market grow even stronger. Death of classmate typically gets you at least a half day. Most teachers only make enough money to afford peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. Actually much safer to allow trained teachers to concealed-carry peanuts."
Resigned Nutritionists Now Recommend Eating 3 Servings A Day Of Mice Or Bark Or Whatever,2/12/20,1183,"ITHACA, NY—Letting out deep sighs of apparent defeat, an exasperated and embittered panel of the nation’s leading nutritionists voiced resignation Thursday when it recommended adults just go ahead and consume three servings per day of mice or bark or whatever. “As far as we’re concerned, you people can swallow ping-pong balls whole—we don’t give a shit,” said Professor Marie Barrow of Cornell University’s Division of Nutritional Science, who shrugged as she suggested Americans maintain balanced portions sizes of insects, batteries, house cats, small kitchen appliances, or anything else they want to try cramming indiscriminately down their throats. “We’ve spent our careers providing you with carefully researched advice, but obviously no one is listening. So go outside and eat handfuls of grass and dirt, if you’d like. Or just keep your mouth open and see what lands in it. When you’re eating that much, you’re bound to run into some vitamins by chance, eventually.” The nutritionists then reiterated that Americans should try to limit themselves to three meals day, unless of course they’re rather have four, or five, or 15, because obviously no one fucking cares anymore."
Health Officials Warn It Is Impossible To Tell If American Cruise Ship Passengers Suffering From Coronavirus Or Just Like That,2/10/20,1368,"WASHINGTON—In a concerning development regarding the potentially deadly epidemic, health officials warned Monday that it was impossible to tell if American cruise ship passengers had contracted coronavirus or if they were just like that. “After extensive observation, we are still unable to determine if the passengers aboard our nation’s cruise ships have coronavirus or if the potential symptoms are simply a result of their lifestyle choices,” said Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar, telling reporters that runny noses and headaches experienced by passengers may be due to decades of poor eating habits and lack of exposure to the outdoors. “We’ve received dozens of reports of Americans struggling to breathe and generally feeling unwell, and while this definitely could be a result of the coronavirus, it could just as likely be due to the prevalence of drink specials and all-you-can-eat seafood buffets aboard ship. At one point, we were fairly certain that we had found an outbreak, but it turned out the passengers’ profuse sweating and pallid skin were a result of them having to walk up a flight of stairs when the ship’s elevator was out of order.” Azar added that the HHS had determined that the bloated skin, dehydration, and prolonged vomiting experienced by American cruise ship passengers had nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus."
Study Finds Leading Cause Of Childhood Obesity Witches Fattening Up Children To Be Eaten,2/10/20,1199,"ATLANTA—Urging parents to learn about the dangers lurking in the enchanted forest, a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found Monday that the leading cause of childhood obesity was malevolent witches fattening up children with an intention to eat them. “Our findings show that more and more young Americans have been wandering into the woods, only to be accosted by an old, magical crone who wants nothing more than to plump them up like a piggie and get them ready for stew,” said CDC chief of staff Kyle McGowen, noting a strong statistical correlation between rising BMI percentages and children eating all the Turkish delight, bread pudding, and homemade taffy that their little hearts desire. “Unfortunately, the correlation between excess weight gain and being placed in a steaming cauldron by a witch while she hand-feeds you cherry pie and cackles is extremely high. And what’s worse, by the time these children find themselves on a dinner platter with an apple shoved in their mouths, it’s already too late.” While McGowen emphasized that there was no quick fix to this epidemic, he advised children to leave a trail of breadcrumbs wherever they go, just in case."
10 Easy Exercises You Can Do At The Office,1/28/20,1975,"Finding time in your schedule to work out can be difficult, which is why performing a few easy exercises at the office can be the perfect way for a busy person to stay in shape. For example, sneak in a low-impact training session during a weekly budget meeting by doing a few sets of lunges. Work those fast-twitch muscles by repeatedly flipping the light switch in the conference room. Desktop computers can double as fitness balls. Simply unplug your machine, seat yourself on the monitor, and gently bounce up and down to strengthen your core. For a good cardio workout with added resistance, run five laps around the office with the photocopier strapped to your back. Build muscle mass by doing several sets of desk calendar curls. Seated in your chair, firmly grip a desk calendar and raise it toward your shoulder in a controlled motion. If you find it too challenging, keep ripping out months until the weight is more comfortable. Your boss looks like he weighs, what, 190? 195? Pick him up. Chair tosses are a great way to bulk up. Stand in front of your desk. Grip your chair and throw it straight up in front of you. The legs should clear your head each time. Do three sets of 50. To get a good full-body workout, pull the fire alarm, stand in the exit, and push back against your coworkers as they try to escape down the stairs. Swimming can burn lots of calories with little impact on your joints. Fill your office with at least four feet of water and practice a variety of strokes. Work your shoulders and triceps by packing your belongings in this box and leaving by 5 p.m. Your new relationship may seem perfect, but the reality is, the human brain is remarkably good at excusing egregious… This should never happen, period. If someone feels nothing after losing a family member or friend, they are a psychopath, and you can say whatever you… Why should your relationship lack romance just because you can’t touch, feel, or experience your partner in the same…"
Xi Jinping Vows To Combat Coronavirus By Making It Illegal To Mention Within A Week,1/27/20,953,"BEIJING—In an effort to assuage concerns about how his government has handled the deadly disease outbreak, Chinese president Xi Jinping held a press conference Monday to announce plans to combat the coronavirus by making it illegal to mention within the next week. “We are directing massive resources towards eradicating the slightest hint of any person speaking about the virus, and I promise you that any conversation or literature pertaining to the virus will be completely eliminated during the next seven days,” said Xi, warning that if immediate action was not taken, it could be too late to stop the spread of information. “We have already seen far too many senseless deaths as a result of this outbreak, so I vow here and now that those official death toll numbers will remain unchanged.” Xi closed his remarks by urging anyone who believed they were suffering from the outbreak or knew someone who was to come forward so they could be executed."
CDC Urges Americans To Just Say No If Friend Offers Them Coronavirus,1/27/20,1111,"ATLANTA—In an effort to stop the spread of the potentially lethal pathogen, the Centers for Disease Control held a press conference Monday to urge Americans to just say “No” if a friend offers them the coronavirus. “While it may seem cool to be seen around the park or the mall with a runny nose and hacking cough, there are very real negative side effects to experimenting with this virus,” said Satish Pillai, a medical officer in the Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, asking the assembled reporters to remember that the most deadly disease vector of all is peer pressure. “I know what you’re thinking: ‘I’ll just get a couple of respiratory infections at a party. I can stop anytime I want.’ But it’s not that simple, and soon the virus has you in its seductive grip. So, if you see someone collapsing from a fever, just tell them, ‘No thanks, I don’t need an infectious agent to have fun.’” Pillai added that if you feel you absolutely must try the coronavirus, be sure to contract it from someone you know and trust as it may turn out to be something more lethal, such as Avian Flu or SARS."
Canadian Man Wishes There Was Some Way To Pay His Doctor For All The Hard Work He Did,1/21/20,1069,"TORONTO—Explaining that he hated to think of all the physician’s efforts going unrewarded, Canadian citizen Ryan Munley stated Tuesday that he wished there was some way he could pay his medical doctor for all his hard work. “Dr. Leva really went above and beyond for me, and I wish there were some method of exchange, preferably one that would put me in debt far beyond my usual retirement age, I could engage in to display my appreciation,” said Munley, who confessed to feeling as if he were stealing from his internist outright, especially since the clinician required multiple rounds of appointments and testing in order to achieve a diagnosis and devise a treatment plan. “My doctor, like so many, is a dedicated professional who works extremely hard, yet I am unable to give him a single dollar, let alone nearly bankrupt my family in order to pay for his services. It hardly seems civilized.” Several personal checks that Munley tried to send his to doctor’s practice have reportedly been returned along with legal notices reprimanding him for attempted payment."
Jimmy Carter Devotes Rest Of Life To Raising Awareness Of Fact That Men Get UTIs Too,12/05/19,1309,"PLAINS, GA—As he continues to rest and recover following a brush with the ailment earlier this week, former President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday he would spend the remainder of his life educating people about the fact that men, too, routinely suffer from urinary tract infections. “This isn’t just an issue that affects women: Every urethra is delicate and susceptible, with roughly one in 10 men contracting a UTI at some point during their life,” said the 39th president of the United States, confirming he would immediately sever ties with Habitat for Humanity and terminate the Carter Center’s long-running program to eradicate Guinea worm disease in order to focus solely on the promotion of healthy male urinary tracts. “This painful affliction is often misdiagnosed, so if you feel a sharp burning sensation when urinating or notice an unfamiliar discharge in your urine, make sure you get tested. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, and there’s no reason to live in discomfort when treatment is readily available. They give you some pills and it clears right up.” At press time, Carter was reportedly going from stall door to stall door in a public men’s room, where he urged occupants to reduce their risk of a UTI by drinking plenty of fluids and keeping the tip of their penis clean and dry."
Only Person Who Ever Truly Saw World For What It Is Starts Antidepressant Medication,11/21/19,1059,"DAYTON, OH—Voluntarily surrendering the remarkable talent that gave her profound insight into the true nature of existence, the only person with the ability to see the world for what it actually is has started taking antidepressants, sources confirmed Thursday.

According to sources, Pearson had carried the burden of her vast wisdom from her teenage years up until this week, when the daily 50 milligram dose of her medication began to correct for her brain’s serotonin deficiency. At press time, accounts confirmed Pearson had already capitulated to the cosmic farce of humanity by enjoying a night out with friends instead of brooding over the cold and vast nothingness of the universe."
Flu Outbreak Reduces Class Sizes To Level Appropriate For Learning,11/15/19,1153,"ST. LOUIS—With student-to-teacher ratios beginning to approach a more manageable level, sources confirmed Friday that a highly infectious strain of the flu sweeping through Washington Middle School this month has reduced class sizes to the point that learning is now feasible. “With this terrible illness forcing so many of our kids to stay home, I can actually give the students who remain some of the individualized attention they deserve,” said American history teacher Gina Wright, who along with her colleagues reported finally being able to meet some of the basic educational needs of her pupils now that a devastating virus has infected more than 300 of the school’s children. “Our classes are still overcrowded, but if a few more kids go down, it may, for the first time, be possible to implement a truly adequate curriculum. I’m sure we could have caught the outbreak earlier if we were able to afford school nurses. To be honest, though, this is a pretty nice trade-off.” Wright went on to predict that a new round of cuts to the school lunch program would likely weaken student health and keep class sizes small as more children are sickened."

New Fitness Tracker Monitors Amount Of Exercise Users Watch On TV,9/25/19,1369,"SAN FRANCISCO—Hailing the product as a huge step forward in health monitor technology, representatives from Fitbit held a product-reveal event today at which shareholders were shown a new fitness tracker capable of monitoring the amount of exercise the wearer watches on television. “Using the latest in optical nerve monitoring, the Fitbit Tele-View Alta allows users to set and achieve goals for watching televised activity of all types,” said Fitbit CEO James Park, emphasizing how the Tele-View Alta allows users to track activity from commercials, sports games, and training montages, making special mention of a feature enabling the device to remind the user to turn on the television if a significant interval had passed since the wearer saw a character stand or stretch. “I think our user community will be pleasantly surprised at how much exercise they watch, whether they’re catching a passing glance of a character walking on TV in a store window display or watching a home improvement host climb stairs while they’re at the dentist. As long as they avoid watching sedentary characters or seeing themselves in the mirror, they’ll hit their exercise-watching goal well before their viewing binge is over.” Early beta testers of the new Tele-View Alta have already figured out how to cheat the system by leaving the tracker in front of the TV while they sleep."
CDC Investigating As Third Teen Ends Up Dead After Wandering Into Mysterious Cloud Of Vape Mist,9/06/19,1385,"ATLANTA—In an effort to glean more information on the continuing epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly launched an investigation Friday as a third teen showed up dead after wandering into the mysterious cloud of vape mist that’s been spreading across the country. “It’s too early to definitively link these deaths to the impenetrable shroud of e-cigarette vapor engulfing the nation, but the fact that multiple teens have been swallowed by the mist only to be discovered days later with their skin flayed and eyes oozing blood is a concerning sign,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, urging Americans who were considering entering the opaque, tutti-frutti-scented fog to do so with extreme caution until more evidence could be collected. “We have yet to determine whether it’s some quality of the mist itself that’s causing these deaths, or if there’s an unspeakable horror lurking within. I should also stress that numerous teenagers who have entered the mist have displayed no physical symptoms, though their time in the vape cloud does usually leave them mumbling incoherently or attempting to grab a police officer’s pistol and shoot themselves in the head to silence the demons.” At press time, Redfield noted that the investigation remained inconclusive after sending wave upon wave of researchers into the mist only for them to disappear forever. "
Field Of Demography Collapses After 92-Year-Old Woman Buys Monster Energy Drink And Sweet Fusion Vape Juice,8/21/19,1397,"BOSTON—Revealing that they would immediately halt all research and shutter all relevant university programs, representatives from the field of demographic research and analysis announced at a press conference Wednesday that the discipline had completely collapsed when Alice Cromwell, 92, purchased a Monster energy drink and a sweet fusion vape juice over the weekend. “The undeniable fact that an elderly woman premeditatedly and purposefully selected a can of Monster brand Baller’s Blend Punch energy drink and a cartridge of e-liquid has fundamentally disproven the major tenets of this field of study,” said Boston University’s Dr. Laurence Park moments before voluntarily resigning, noting that the nonagenarian’s decision to use Apple Pay for her purchases and then make her way home on a longboard had significantly hastened the collapse of the discipline. “When the data was first reported, we believed this incident was merely a mistake in data collection, but we ultimately realized that this grandmother of four bought these items completely of her own volition after weighing several purchasing options, and basic extrapolation leads us to conclude that everything we have studied for decades has been a lie.” Park added that any hope for the continued existence for the field had evaporated when Cromwell’s purchase of Metamucil turned out to be a gift for her 12-year-old grandson."

Study Finds Majority Of American Health Insurance Plans Don’t Cover Sending Sickly Child To Convalesce In Countryside,7/12/19,1618,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Calling much-needed attention to the issue, a study released this week by Harvard University researchers found that almost no American health insurance plans provide coverage for sending a sickly child off to convalesce in the countryside. “Though it is generally agreed that many childhood ailments are remedied by sending wan and pallid children to stay with distant relatives in rural hamlets by the sea or remote mountain villages, such treatment is not included in over half of HMO and PPO plans,” said lead researcher Dr. Melissa Rhodes, stressing that of those insurance options that do provide coverage for transporting wicker-wheelchair-bound children to take the air in climates beneficial in relieving languor of the circulation, brain fever, consumption, and other diminishing ailments, most require a hefty co-pay or the meeting of a high deductible. “Unlike most European countries, where universal care includes retreats to seaside cottages where weak or enervated children are bundled in robes and white nightgowns, parents in the United States are forced to pay for these expenses out-of-pocket or rely on the charity of a wealthy local dowager. Tragically, figures seem to indicate that those whose insurance plans cover wellness sojourns to the fresh country air necessary for alacritous healing of weak lungs to fine fettle often use the services, only to have their claims denied by the insurance company.” Harvard’s study comes on the heels of similar research which found most insurance providers only offer members mental health treatment at the hands of an in-network lobotomist."

Just take a deep breath, and before you know it, you’re going to be passed out in a limp heap,” said Dr. Geiss, informing the nervous patient in calm tones that she would hardly feel a thing, aside from one massive and overwhelming pain spike as the small contraceptive device was inserted into her uterus. “Listen, don’t worry. This is totally routine. You’ll feel a tiny twinge of pain, and the next thing you know, we’ll be peeling your limp body off the linoleum and you’ll come to in a couple hours. I want you to relax and count to ten with your eyes closed, and reopen them when you finally regain consciousness.” Dr. Geiss warned Juarez of the potential side effects of receiving the IUD, including occasional nausea, abdominal and pelvic cramping, and possible severe headaches as a result of hitting her head while collapsing to the ground from the sheer shock."
"New Report Finds Energy Drink Consumption Can Lead To Heart Bursting Out Of Chest, Riding Away On Tiny Skateboard",6/03/19,1360,"SALT LAKE CITY—Researchers from the cardiology division of the University of Utah School of Medicine released a new report Monday revealing that consumption of energy drinks can lead to your heart bursting out of your chest and riding away on a tiny skateboard. “Our study found that individuals who ingest just one or two caffeinated energy drinks a day are at a far greater risk of their heart erupting from their torso and cruising off into the distance, popping heelflips while exclaiming, ‘Later suckers!’” said lead researcher Marcus Kabeer, explaining how the ingredients in the beverages produced electrical disturbances in the vital muscular organ and increased the possibility that the skateboarding heart will attempt a dangerous 720 gazelle flip and suffer severe physical damage if it fails to land the gnarly trick. “Although we’ve yet to pinpoint the exact chemical reaction that causes the heart to wear a miniature backwards trucker hat, we believe that the combination of caffeine, vitamin B, and taurine is linked to the cardiovascular organ grinding down a stairwell railing and flipping off a pursuing security guard with its ventricles.” At press time, the researchers confirmed that they had documented a number of troubling instances in which several skateboarding hearts gathered in a convenience store parking lot to smoke cigarettes."

CDC Warns Once-Eradicated Jitterbug Spreading Across Country At Rate Not Seen Since 1940s,4/25/19,1092,"ATLANTA—Saying that they’d seen a significant spike in reported cases, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a statement Thursday warning that the once-eradicated jitterbug has started to spread across the country at a rate not seen since the 1940s. “We thought we had completely wiped out the jitterbug, but unfortunately, it’s come surging back and young people are at the greatest risk,” said CDC spokesperson Rebeccah Lior, explaining that the affliction typically starts at one’s hands and spreads to the feet, manifesting in symptoms such as uncontrollable finger snapping, hip-swinging, and tapping of the toes. “We haven’t seen outbreaks this significant since around World War II. Until we figure out how to best stymie the spread of the jitterbug, it’s important to take precautions, such as not letting your children go to public dance halls or gin joints where it can be contracted.” Lior went on to add that the return of the jitterbug could lead to the resurgence of other once nearly wiped-out scourges such as the Watusi and the mashed potato. "

Even moderate exercise and a slightly more varied diet could have a major impact on my health, and if I don’t make these changes now, I could face some serious issues down the road. So when I see you for your next checkup, I’d like to see myself a little slimmer.” According to reports, Gerheart went on to show Torres a list of healthy snack options he could eat in order to break his junk food habit. "

Responsible Gym Member Makes Sure To Wipe Down Personal Trainer After Workout,3/14/19,987,"ANNANDALE, VA—Saying it was just “common courtesy” to sanitize them for whoever exercised next, local man Nick Dukas told reporters Thursday that he always makes sure to wipe down his personal trainer after working out. “I sweat all over, so it would be pretty rude of me not to at least clean the fitness instructor up before hitting the locker room,” said Dukas as he wiped the surface of the muscular, over-six-foot-tall exercise consultant with a disposable disinfecting cloth, explaining how gross it was to start a workout session when your fitness guru was all smelly and covered in germs. “Not only is it important to prevent the spread of bacteria and infections, but also, disinfecting his hands and feet only takes two seconds. I remember using a guy named Daniel once after somebody forgot to clean him, and I got the nastiest rash.” At press time, Dukas added that after wiping down his personal trainer, he always makes sure to put him back in the correct spot on the rack."
Scientists Genetically Engineer Lab Rat Predisposed To Think Anything Wrong With It Might Be Cancer,3/07/19,1300,"ROCHESTER, MN—In a development that could provide valuable insight into the study of hypochondria, scientists at the Mayo Clinic introduced a strain of genetically engineered lab rats Thursday predisposed to think anything wrong with them might be cancer. “Thanks to new cutting-edge technology, we have produced a laboratory rat highly prone to believing any sniffle or cough is the first symptom of some terrible, life-threatening disease,” said lead researcher Marie Dyer, confirming that the rodents lay awake at night worrying that the bruise on their tail is undiagnosed leukemia and routinely tell their loved ones that the lump on their paw is probably a malignant tumor. “These animals are convinced they’re sick, spending the majority of their waking hours in a state of anxiety imagining every worst-case scenario regarding their health. They have been bred to panic about early-onset dementia any time they can’t remember a name and are likely to fall to the cage floor squeaking about ‘the big one’ whenever their heart skips a beat. We hope to glean a lot of valuable information from these fretful rodents who constantly assume they’re at death’s door.” Dyer added that the scientists were interested in how the laboratory rats would react once they actually were injected with cancer."
Scientists Pinpoint Part Of Brain All Your Hair Grows Out Of,3/07/19,1493,"PROVIDENCE, RI—In a groundbreaking discovery they say will provide new insights into the complex functioning of the neural system, scientists at Brown University announced Thursday that, through the use of magnetic resonance imaging, they have successfully identified the part of the brain all your hair grows out of. “For centuries, medical science has struggled to understand hair—why humans produce it, what conditions result in certain colorations or cowlicks, and why some people experience thinning over time. Now, after extensive research, we’ve found the precise location of the brain where all human follicles grow from,” said lead neuroscientist Dr. Avi Samuel, confirming the long-debated hypothesis that patients who experience baldness may have underdeveloped prefrontal lobes or have suffered irreversible brain damage. “Initially, we had to admit that we had no idea where human hair came from. Of course, we firmly rejected the old superstition that hair grew forth from the soul, but we honestly couldn’t come up with a better explanation. But after months of scans, we can now confirm that at the onset of puberty, this fertile region of the human cerebrum kicks into overdrive, sprouting as much body hair as possible, and maintains this follicular capacity throughout the human lifespan.” The research study further suggests that memories may be stored in each individual strand of hair, providing yet another reason why it may be dangerous to attempt to cut your own hair."
Study Finds Sedentary Lifestyle Puts Millions Of Americans At Risk Of Becoming Beautiful Just The Way They Are,2/06/19,1594,"WALTHAM, MA—Providing new insights into the aesthetic implications of general inactivity among adults, a study published Monday at Brandeis University revealed that increasingly sedentary lifestyles, when combined with a decline in recreational exercise and a national diet trending ever higher in fats and starches, put millions of Americans at risk of becoming “beautiful just the way they are.” “Analysis of subjects across several demographics leads us to conclude that prolonged physical inactivity exacerbated by a high-calorie diet has already led to a significant segment of the U.S. population being, you know, ‘absolutely perfect in their own special way,’” said lead researcher Shyeta Wilson, noting that extended periods of sitting, lounging, or reclining with favorite snacks are leading indicators of contracting heart disease, diabetes, and being “a totally worthwhile person who doesn’t have to change a single thing.” “Cultural shifts away from labor-intensive lifestyles, coupled with advancements in technology, have contributed to a less physical way of life, so we will continue to see more people on the fast-track to ‘accepting themselves as the special, unique hotties they are.’ For most adults, if they haven’t adopted a routine with minimal movement already, it may be too late to reverse the effects of becoming ‘a person who, deep down, is actually gorgeous and truly deserving of love.’” Wilson stressed the importance of instilling these habits at a young age so kids can become aware that they are “utterly flawless,” making their teen years “an absolute dream.”"

Doctors Assure Recovering Patient He Has Many More Years Of Looking At Phone Ahead Of Him,1/23/19,1041,"KANSAS CITY, MO—After a biopsy determined a tumor removed from his kidney was benign, local 28-year-old Andrew Keller was reportedly reassured by doctors Wednesday that he still had quite a few years of staring at his smartphone ahead of him. “Good news: The tests came back completely negative, which means you’ll be mindlessly scrolling through the apps on your phone for decades to come,” said Saint Luke’s Hospital nephrologist Elizabeth Steltzer, adding that she had feared the mass in Keller’s kidney might have been renal cell carcinoma, a disease that could rob him of years spent hunching over electronic devices and gazing vacantly into their screens. “My prognosis is that you’ll be scanning your feeds and tapping on touch-screen devices for a long, long time.

Study: 30% Of People Who Quit Smoking Relapse After Shakily Raising Cigarette Up To Lips When Agreeing To Turn State’s Evidence,1/23/19,1697,"BETHESDA, MD—In a groundbreaking new study on the effects of stressful everyday events on the addiction patterns of average Americans, the National Institutes of Health found this week that upwards of 30 percent of those who quit smoking will relapse by raising a cigarette to their lips with trembling fingers as they agree to turn state’s evidence in a major federal case. “While more than half of all current tobacco users across the country attempt to kick their nicotine addiction, nearly a third wind up accepting a cigarette from a hard pack of Marlboros held out by an undercover cop, lighting it up with the officer’s Zippo after finding ther tremor-ridden hands incapable of lighting a match, and then spilling everything about their involvement in a major criminal conspiracy,” said lead researcher Dr. Evan Stuss, explaining that the strongest indicator of an incipient relapse are repeated denials that this could possibly be happening before inevitably letting a detective’s cupped hands block the wind on the rain-swept promontory while the cigarette in question is lit. “Most addicts are successful in staving off cravings for a few hours, but once an implacable investigative team offers them immunity from prosecution and points out that they can’t be protected from the wrath of the shady investment bank, international criminal consortium, or Esposito if they don’t testify, fully a third of Americans tend to light up.” The study also revealed that 50 percent of former smokers either remain indecisive at this time and are being allowed to stew in their own juices for now while another 15 percent have firmly stated that they may be a lot of things, but they ain’t no narcs."
Voyeur Researchers Recommend At Least 7 Hours Of Watching Someone Sleep Per Night,12/20/18,1237,"ANN ARBOR, MI—Emphasizing that their subjects felt healthier, more energetic, and oh, so satisfied the next morning, voyeur researchers at the University of Michigan recommended Thursday that the average adult spend at least seven hours each night watching another person sleep. “Based on our findings, anyone over the age of 18 should make an effort to spend a minimum of two REM cycles silently standing over a stranger who is beautiful and helpless, yet just out of reach,” said lead researcher Jasmine Alvarez, adding that the fewer interruptions that occurred while breaking into their house, perching over their bed, and watching them sleep, the better. “While it might not be possible every night, you should definitely get close to their face, no more than six to eight inches away, as often as possible. This way, you’ll be able to feel their rejuvenating breath as you gaze at their stomachs slowly rising and falling. In addition, we found that such behavior is especially beneficial if the person is perfect—so, so perfect. Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.” Alvarez also suggested that individuals adhere to a consistent morning routine by placing a gentle, almost imperceptible kiss on the sleeping person’s forehead just before dawn. "
Frat Nutritionists Dare Americans To Swallow More Live Goldfish,12/12/18,1126,"NORMAN, OK—Claiming that the average person needs to just man the fuck up and do it already, frat nutritionists attending the University of Oklahoma dared Americans on Wednesday to swallow more live goldfish. “We’ve discovered that consuming two to three live goldfish per weekend significantly reduces the risk of being a complete gash,” said Sigma Chi rush chair and dietary researcher Cody Wilson, adding that this was something everyone else had to do if they wanted in, so you should just quit acting like such a bitch and open your goddamn whiny mouth. “Live fish is rich in essential shut up and fucking do it, and an excellent source of walk your pussy ass over to Delta if you’re not going to swallow it, you pansy.

It’s a great little pick-me-up. Sure, there’s still caffeine in the cola, but it’s just enough to help keep the cravings away. I only wish I had made the switch sooner.” Packer claims the small change in her routine has decreased the amount of time she used to spend tossing and turning before falling asleep at night, and that her drive to work was both much faster and less stressful."
Report: Those Sensors That Flush Public Toilets Were Also Cameras This Whole Time,12/10/18,1029,"NEW YORK—A report published Monday by researchers at the Journal Of Public Health Management And Practice revealed those sensors that flush public toilets were also cameras this whole time. “After decades of relying on the devices for automated flushing, it appears those red blinking sensors in toilet stalls have also been filming each and every one of their users as they relieved themselves,” read the report in part, which added that the sensors use their camera functionality to record around-the-clock footage of bowel movements and urinations before transmitting the video to the 2.5 million people employed to monitor these feeds. “These are state-of-the-art cameras, as well. So although they’re only recording you from behind, their little electric eyes can see everything. They can even zoom in for incredibly detailed close-ups.” The report also described how the high-definition microphones hidden in the manual override buttons also pick up a constant audio feed that is immediately transmitted along when pressed."

Let us assure you that there have been considerable advancements in gynecology, so we can safely extract any item even if it’s crammed in there sideways. Tampons, sex toys, USB flash drives, frozen hot dogs, puzzle pieces, we’ve seen it all.” At press time, the nation’s gynecologists had released a follow-up statement admitting that they lacked the tools and methods to successfully remove a used condom.

A nice thin rail, dance to four or five songs, chill a bit, get some tapas, another rail, no harm done, right? Right. Cool. Cool Cool. And please don’t drink too much, either, that’s pissing into the wind. If you’re gonna be mixing it with scotch, you might as well just sneeze a hundred bucks into a Kleenex.” Adams further stated that the music has to be right, that there is no shame in going home early if everyone is making you twitchy, and that you and he should really open up a restaurant together."
"Study Finds Mediterranean Diet Adds Years To Your Life, But Only By Taking Them Away From Others",11/09/18,1228,"SOUTH KINGSTOWN, RI—Researchers at the University of Rhode Island published a study Friday revealing that the Mediterranean diet can, in fact, add years to one’s life, but only by taking them away from others. “Our study confirms that a diet rich in foods such as olive oil, fish, and green vegetables can extend one’s lifespan by several years, as long as a life-expectancy equilibrium is maintained through reducing another person’s life by an equal amount of time,” said head researcher Mara Haugen, hypothesizing that the phenomenon could possibly be attributed to the complex but lesser-known vampiric properties of omega-3 fatty acids. “We’ve found that people who adhere to the Mediterranean diet tend to feel more energized during the day and sleep more peacefully at night, feeding as they do off the waning life force of another human being, who withers and becomes sickly in turn. This is a huge breakthrough in the field of nutrition, and we highly recommend people adopt the lifestyle before they fall victim to it.” Haugen went on to speculate that, if a person was fully committed to the Mediterranean diet, it may be possible for them to draw enough life force from the Earth’s population to achieve immortality."
Report: Rash Not Going Away On Its Own,10/30/18,845,"SAN FRANCISCO—Noting no improvements since suddenly appearing on his left arm several weeks ago, a detailed report released Tuesday by local man Derrick Hart revealed that his rash was not going away. “I don’t know what it’s from, but now it’s starting to hurt,” said Hart, explaining that he first noticed the skin irritation over three weeks ago and after conducting several methods of treatment, including soap and water, anti-itch cream, and, finally, leaving it alone for a few days, he concluded that these experiments had little to no effect. “It has definitely changed; there’s a weird, yellowish crust growing on it now. I’m pretty sure this is a sign it’s getting worse though because now it’s on my other arm, too.” Hart concluded that further research would need to be done as he entered his symptoms into an internet search browser."
New Study Shows Majority Of Late Afternoon Sleepiness At Work Caused By Undetected Carbon Monoxide Leak,10/29/18,1265,"WASHINGTON—Investigating a sudden uptick in nationwide on-the-job somnolence, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration released a study Monday showing that the majority of late afternoon sleepiness in the American workplace is in fact caused by an undetected carbon monoxide leak. “Our investigations found that a lack of focus, weariness, or general disinclination to perform at a job after normal lunch hours is most likely a sign that an employee is breathing in colorless, odorless, noxious fumes,” said lead researcher Mario Garrison, noting that over half the people who are feeling any kind of exhaustion or sluggishness at their place of employment between the hours of noon and 3 p.m. are being slowly poisoned at their desks or workstations. “Employees who become sleepy and close their eyes during the afternoon are in danger of never opening them again. The buildup of gas can be slow, as carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air, so it may go unnoticed the entire morning. But make no mistake: From your first workplace yawn, you could be dead within an hour.” Garrison suggested that anyone who was feeling even the slightest bit tired in the afternoon hours at their place of employment should take the rest of the day off."
CDC Introduces ‘Raw Dog’ The STI Pup To Educate Children About The Dangers Of Unprotected Sex,10/26/18,3936,"ATLANTA—In an effort to introduce the subject in a fun and kid-friendly way, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday the launch of its new “Raw Dog the STI Pup” campaign, which warns young children about the dangers of unprotected sex. The campaign’s stated aim is to raise student awareness of sexually transmitted infections by distributing to the nation’s health educators thousands of colorful posters, stickers, and storybooks featuring Raw Dog, a mangy, lesion-ridden puppy who fails to use protection. The CDC said it believes kids between the ages of 8 and 12 will respond to the mischievous but lovable canine, who embarks upon misadventures with a colorful cast of animal friends named Hepatitis Bee, Clam Idia, and Sperm Whale.
 “With the nation’s STI rate at a record high, we realized we needed a fun-loving character like Raw Dog who could really show kids the importance of throwing on a glove before you fuck,” said CDC representative Martin Searle, who described how Raw Dog developing jaundiced yellow eyes and fungal blisters after failing to “wrap his wick” offered an entertaining and thought-provoking tale that children could easily grasp. “It’s amazing how quickly youngsters pick up on Raw Dog’s lessons when they see him complaining about frequent penile discharge or dragging his ass along the ground because gonorrhea makes him itchy.”
 “Plus, he’s so darn cute!” added Searle, cradling one of the many shedding, patchy-furred Raw Dog plush toys being sent to classrooms nationwide.
 Through storytelling, puppetry, and sing-alongs featuring Raw Dog’s pesky foes, Stinky and Pinky, CDC officials said they hope to drive home the benefits of proper prophylactic use to elementary school students. The agency also detailed plans to send costumed characters such as Gretchen the Genital Warthog to schools for in-class demonstrations of how “getting ridden hard without a rubber” can lead to a lifetime of genital herpes outbreaks.
 According to the CDC, the campaign will also provide educators with 45-minute animated videos depicting Raw Dog’s troubles, including Don’t Forget To Wear A Hat, Raw Dog!, a story in which the narrator scolds the incorrigible for puppy for not wearing a condom while “busting a nut,” and You Don’t Look So Good, Raw Dog!, in which syphilis from bareback sex in an alley behind a dumpster causes him to develop painful, oozing pustules and start urinating blood.
 “We’re really exploring some pretty exciting ways to show young kids the importance of strapping that shit before intercourse,” said Searle, pointing to Raw Dog’s Hole-Pounding Adventure, a CDC-designed tablet game in which players must swipe furiously to stop the puppy from dropping his bone into holes where it doesn’t belong. “We’re also working on some interactive skits where kids get to role-play calling up Raw Dog’s former partners after he tests positive for HIV.”
 “After all, it’s just like Raw Dog always tells kids: ‘Don’t be like me, or your genitals will get ruff!’” Searle continued.
 The campaign has been criticized by many Catholic and evangelical groups, who have demanded the CDC bring back its Reagan-era CelibaSea Lion character, who urged young girls to take chastity pledges and “never get wet” until marriage. Doubts have also been expressed by parents who normally support safe-sex education.
 “I’m glad they’re teaching this stuff, but some of the materials give me pause,” said Greg Jensen, 43, a parent of a fourth-grader at Lincoln Elementary in Sioux Falls, SD where a pilot version of the campaign was conducted last year. “It’s just a little awkward when my kid comes home with a big stack of pamphlets showing the Hepatitis Bee saying ‘Zzz, watch out where you sit!’ or Raw Dog biting at his crotch while a bunch of little crabs pinch his hindquarters.”
 He added, “Plus, at this age, I mostly just want my son to be learning about mouth and hand stuff.”

Report: Logan’s Mom Put Him On A Diet,10/26/18,1031,"TERRE HAUTE, IN—Noting the dramatic change in snacks and beverages made available at the Pisinski household, sleepover sources confirmed Friday that Logan’s mom had put him on a diet. “He’s not allowed to have any soda or candy, plus his mom put all the bags of chips way up high in the pantry so he can’t reach them,” said Jesse Weir, adding that while he and the other guests ate pepperoni pizza, Logan was served a green salad with a fat-free dressing and was offered the choice between a rice cake topped with cottage cheese or an apple for dessert. “He’s got a whole section in the refrigerator labeled ‘Logan’s Snacks’ and there’s nothing good in there, just carrots and celery sticks. When Mrs. Pisinski caught Logan eating some M&Ms that Kevin brought, she made him spit them out in the trash, so it’s a pretty big deal.” Weir added that he probably wouldn’t be going back over to Logan’s house for a while after Mrs. Pisinski told them they couldn’t play video games and should instead all go outside to get some exercise."
Study Finds Effectiveness Of Medical Treatment Skyrockets When Doctor Acts Like Condescending Dick,10/25/18,1242,"BALTIMORE—A study published Thursday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the effectiveness of medical treatment skyrockets when the doctor acts like a condescending dick. “Our research proves that a patient’s long-term prognosis is directly and positively tied to having an MD who is an unrepentant, patronizing asshole,” said lead researcher Dr. Bethany Frey, adding that sick patients whose physician waves away their concerns with a brusk, “You’re not the medical professional, I am,” saw a 30 percent increase in survival rates and fewer instances of self-reported pain. “Whether you’re dealing with the common cold or Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, you want a doctor who will rush through your appointment, cut you off before you finish describing your symptoms, and then scribble something on your chart as they walk out of the room. Physicians who showed an empathetic bedside manner had poorer outcomes overall compared to those who are complete pricks. In some cases, being a fucking huge cock is literally the difference between life and death.” The study also confirmed that patients are less likely to abuse pain medications when an eye-rolling nurse curtly tells them to suck it up because it doesn’t hurt that bad."
Embarrassed CDC Announces It Accidentally Switched Flu Shots With HIV,10/18/18,1531,"ATLANTA—Informing the more than 150 million Americans affected by the error that the mistake was “totally our bad,” embarrassed officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that they had accidentally switched all 2018 flu shots with samples of HIV. “Oh, god, we really and truly screwed the pooch on this one. We wish to say we’re deeply sorry, especially to the 59.1 percent of children in the U.S. who received what they had every right to expect were influenza vaccines this fall. Not that it’s anywhere near adequate consolation, but we’re offering a full refund as a partial apology for infecting you with HIV,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, who explained that the two kinds of vials are stocked “really close to each other, and look practically identical.” “We promise to be way more careful in the future. On the plus side, your HIV is only in the acute infection stage, so many of you have a decent amount of time before you develop full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Yes, obviously, the ideal scenario is to have no life-threatening spectrum of infections destroying your white blood cells, especially—and this is extra embarrassing—during flu season, like it is right now. Man, we were so adamant about you getting these shots in the first place, too.” Redfield encouraged Americans to schedule another flu shot just as soon as the CDC followed up on reports that in the rush to correct the error, some replacement batches had been mistakenly swapped out for anthrax."
U.S. Public Health Service Estimates They’ll Have Tuskegee Experiment Wrapped Up By 2020,10/10/18,1531,"WASHINGTON—Assuring critics that the study would provide valuable information on the spread of sexually transmitted infections in rural populations, the U.S. Public Health Service announced Wednesday that they estimate to have the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male wrapped up by the year 2020. “After decades of very important research, we’re very close to a meaningful conclusion,” said USPHS representative Meredith Powell, expressing the agency’s immense gratitude for the patience of the American public, especially the hundreds of black people diagnosed with syphilis but not informed of or treated for the disease at the experiment’s start in 1932, and the hundreds more who have been diagnosed with the disease within the past year. “Thanks to the uninformed sacrifice of our subjects, we’re closer than ever before to a true understanding of how syphilis progresses through certain communities, and we are optimistic for a conclusion within the next couple years. We believe penicillin might work as a potential cure, but we’re not yet willing to rule out other remedies, such as homeopathic treatment, or even, say, just letting nature take its course. This is a longitudinal study, and we’re coming very close to narrowing our search down to six or seven potential avenues of treatment, at which point we can finally begin the study’s final stage.” Powell added that once the experiment was completed, the agency would be embarking on a 50-year follow-up study to attempt to reproduce their findings."
Excited Patient Points Out Organ He Wants From Kidney Tank In Hospital Lobby,10/09/18,872,"SEATTLE—Exuberantly tapping the glass of the murky case as he tried to attract the attention of hospital staff, transplant patient Robert McCarthy appeared to be barely able to contain his excitement Tuesday while gesturing to the organ he wanted in the surgical wing lobby’s fresh kidney tank. “I want that one, the big one in the corner,” said McCarthy, 46, motioning toward a lively and perfectly bean-shaped renal organ, which medical personnel estimated to be a sprightly 15 years old. “Wow, would you look at the nephrons on that guy? Just one of him ought to be plenty for me—no wonder they say you don’t really need two. Honestly, any of them would probably be great, except maybe that greyish one bobbing at the top.” McCarthy was then helped into a gaily kidney-patterned surgical bib while a doctor used a sterile net and tongs to scoop out his preferred organ."
"Cure For Cancer Only 10 Years Away, Announce Scientists Who Work Better Under A Deadline",10/02/18,1066,"CAMBRIDGE—Admitting that setting clear goalposts would help them with their tendency to procrastinate, scientists at Harvard University who work better under a deadline announced Tuesday that a cure for cancer was only 10 years away. “Okay, we’re coming out and saying, right now, that cancer will be completely eradicated by 2028,” said lead researcher Hana Ward, telling reporters that now that they’d committed to a timeline, it would really push them to stop messing around and get to work. “We’ve all put it in our calendars, so we should be good to go. As soon as we’re done with this press conference, it’s going to be all curing cancer all the time. We urge Americans to remind us of our commitment and really hold our feet to the fire about this to ensure we’re not slacking off. To be on the safe side, we’d recommend that you check back in with us in five years or so to make sure we’re still on track.” Ward added that her team actually had a couple quick things to take care of, but they’d be really putting their noses to the grindstone come next week."
Scientists Close To Developing Life-Saving Vaccine That They Can Rub In Faces Of Their Doubters,9/18/18,1179,"INDIANAPOLIS, IN—Saying the groundbreaking discovery could potentially silence even their fiercest critics, scientists at Indiana University’s School of Medicine announced Tuesday that they had almost developed a life-saving vaccine that they could rub in the faces of all their doubters. “This injection, once it is approved, will have long-lasting ramifications for all of our haters within the medical community who apparently thought they were better than us,” said lead researcher Professor Danielle Padilla, adding that it should only be a few more months until their scumbag PhD rivals, as well as “those cocky bastards at Yale” get their sorry asses handed to them. “In fact, preliminary tests have already shown that they’d better buckle up, because there’s about to be a new big dog in the viral research community. As doctors, scientists, and sometimes patients ourselves, we can’t wait until this product finally reaches the market so we can wipe the floor with those jealous losers for once and for all.” At press time, researchers had quickly retracted all published mentions of the vaccine after FDA testing revealed it had a slew of life-threatening side effects."
Dermatologist Recommends Not Caring So Much What Other People Think,9/12/18,1230,"TUCSON, AZ—While discussing the long-sought secrets of luminous, blemish-free skin, dermatologist Dr. Risa Helene strongly recommended Wednesday that patients commit to a routine of not caring so much what other people think. “The best treatment out there—far healthier than vitamin-rich creams or clinically tested serums—is simply a sustained attitude of self-worth,” said Helene, adding that moisturizing was completely unnecessary if you just put yourself out there and let people see the real you. “Take it from me, most skincare issues, from enlarged pores and blackheads to rosacea and eczema, are caused by worrying too much about the opinions of those who shouldn’t even matter. A positive outlook and some confidence is really all you need for glowing skin. I used to recommend that patients remove any perfumes or scented lotions from their routine to eliminate rashes and dermal irritations, but you know what’s really irritating? Judgy people. As a doctor, all I can really tell you is that you’re beautiful when you just believe in yourself and don’t let negative talk bring you down.” Helene added that sunscreen was superfluous if you take time to look in the mirror twice daily and tell yourself you’re beautiful."
American Psychiatric Association Adds ‘Obsessive Categorization Of Mental Conditions’ To ‘DSM-5’,8/23/18,1532,"WASHINGTON—As part of their ongoing mission to keep their classifications updated with the most recent available findings, the American Psychiatric Association announced Thursday the supplemental addition of “Obsessive Categorization of Mental Conditions” to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders. “We’ve seen a significant increase in the number of people reporting an urgent, uncontrollable desire to research, report on, and catalog the symptoms of various mental disorders,” said head researcher Paula Ramos, stressing several times that the most apparent signs of OCMC include the compulsive noting of minute details regarding thousands and thousands of perceived signs of illness followed by extreme organizational tendencies and repeated attempts to achieve publication in prominent medical journals. “Our findings indicate that this condition exists in a spectrum, with some sufferers focusing on general diseases while others are more prone to clustering within a specific subset of the mental health field. We’re confident that continued study will assist doctors in more easily identifying and treating this debilitating disorder, and what we’ve painstakingly catalogued as its 117 common variants and 286 sub-variants, so that its sufferers can go on to live productive, untroubled lives.” Ramos also suggested that OCMC itself could be merely part of a much larger, though mostly benign, mental disorder involving obsessive attempts at educating oneself in order to help others."
New Liver Can Really Handle Its Scotch,8/23/18,864,"MISHAWAKA, IN—After thoroughly testing its alcohol metabolization and blood-cleansing properties with a 1.75-liter bottle of Cutty Sark, sales manager Randall Young confirmed Thursday that his new liver could really handle its scotch. “I had no idea how bad my old liver was until I tried this one,” Young said of the pristine new multifunction gland he spent nearly two years waiting to take out for a spin. “Seriously, I’ve been pounding this shit all night and I feel completely fine—better than I have in years. Used to be I’d have like 10, maybe 12 shots and I’d be puking up what little bile my old liver could secrete, but this one is a fucking tank. Makes my kidneys look like garbage. I’m ready for another 10, and I’m not even turning yellow.” Young claimed his only regret was that such a “kickass” organ had to spend 28 years cooped up in a triathlete."

It’s one thing to say you support LGBT people. It’s another to actually do something, especially if you can accomplish so much by safely not doing anything.” Woodruff also stated that until gay men could give blood, he would not be volunteering at any food banks."

Beloved Father And Infrequent Pornography User Loses 3-Year Battle With Cancer,7/30/18,1235,"ROCHESTER, NY—After losing a three-year battle with prostate cancer during which he only sporadically masturbated to prurient images, beloved father and infrequent pornography user Larry Gates passed away Monday, surrounded by his loving family in the home where he kept one or two old Playboys which, when in better health, he would take out from the bottom of a desk drawer and beat off to every so often.

Because by the time you’re led over the hills arm-in-arm in a dance of death, it’s already too late.” Campos also warned that although a small percentage of people end up checkmating death, the Grim Reaper would be back for them."

Study: Headaches Are The Body’s Way Of Communicating It Wants Pills,5/10/18,1130,"ROCHESTER, MN—Stressing the importance of afflicted individuals heeding their symptoms, Mayo Clinic researchers released a study Thursday that found that headaches are the human body’s way of communicating that it wants pills. “Our findings prove conclusively that the body uses headaches as a way of signaling that it is experiencing a significant pill deficit,” said lead researcher Julia Perla, explaining that headache severity has a direct relationship to the quantity of pills the body desires. “Moreover, the phenomenon of recurring migraines is a telltale indicator that one’s brain chemistry is suffering an imbalance of pill chemicals. Should this occur, it’s imperative that you shovel as many handfuls of pills, or in extreme cases even capsules and tablets, into your mouth as possible. While pain pills are best, our data indicates that the specific types of pills is secondary to the fact that they are pills.” Researchers added that individuals who even so much as suspect they are starting to feel a headache coming on should begin taking pills every three to five minutes until symptoms are no longer detectable."
Flu Vaccine Recalled Due To Defective Government Tracking Microchips,5/08/18,971,"WASHINGTON—After it was discovered that hundreds of thousands of the state-sanctioned radar systems had short circuited, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recall of the flu vaccine Friday due to defective government tracking microchips. “In response to reports that devices planted in the serum were not properly monitoring Americans movements at all times, we have decided to pull all flu vaccines from pharmacies and clinics,” said CDC director Robert R. Redfield, explaining that anyone who received a vaccine within the last 5 years had likely been given a malfunctioning location-detecting chip and would be offered a replacement free of charge. “We apologize for the mistake and are doing everything within our power to make sure that Americans are safe, healthy, and meticulously followed and observed as they go about their daily lives.” Redfield added that Americans could rest assured that the autism microchip was still working perfectly."

Man, I’ve been craving beef for so long now that I’ll basically take whatever I find lying around.” The bacterium went on to justify the indulgence by saying that the added energy would come in handy during its upcoming trips to Iowa and Nebraska."
Nutritionists Reveal Humans With Proper Diet Should Not Be Defecating,4/30/18,1141,"PALO ALTO, CA—Warning that it is one of the most visible symptoms of serious malnutrition, dietary scientists at Stanford University revealed Monday that humans who consume a proper diet should not be defecating. “In humans who correctly manage their dietary intake, 100 percent of food consumed is absorbed by the body, with any defecation whatsoever being a sign that the diet must be reassessed,” said research leader Angela Nagle, explaining that bodily waste is evidence of an inefficient and improperly functioning digestive system expelling harmful substances and also noting that healthy human beings should not be urinating. “A well-fed body should not be producing any feces or urine whatsoever. As nutrition professionals, most of us have not defecated for 30-40 years, as our bodies convert everything into energy as intended by nature. In fact, if you have defecated at any time in the last week at any time in the last week, you should schedule an appointment with a doctor immediately.” Nagle added that anyone who becomes aware of a defecating infant should immediately report the baby’s parents to child protective services."
Nation’s Baby Boomers Hold Press Conference To Announce They All Have Diseases Now,4/26/18,976,"BOCA RATON, FL—Struggling to deliver the remarks in between violent coughing fits, the nation’s baby boomers held a press conference Thursday to announce that they all have diseases now. “We felt it was important to go on record and affirm that each and every one of us is stricken with an illness now,” said 72-year-old Milton Kofax, hunching over his podium as he explained that while some boomers were sicker than others, the millions of Americans of his generation were all, to a person, in poor health. “While certain symptoms may come and go, the fact that we are afflicted with a variety of ailments will be the one and only constant in our lives from this point forward. Even those of us who seem fit and hardy on the surface are actually suffering from dementia or are simply unaware for the moment of the tumors growing inside them.” Kofax added that he could not say when all baby boomers would be dead, though he acknowledged he was asked that question frequently."
Dermatologists Recommend Regularly Checking Body For Screaming Demonic Face Bulging Out Of Skin,4/13/18,1399,"NEW YORK—Saying it can be as easy as doing a quick once-over in the shower, the American Dermatological Association released a statement Friday recommending thorough, regular checks of the entire body for screaming demonic faces bulging out of your skin. “It’s important to catch these things early, so we suggest incorporating self-examinations into your daily routine and keeping an eye out for any sores, rashes, or lumps that could possibly develop into demons pressing their warped and twisted faces against your skin from the inside, preparing to let out a pained, hellish scream,” the statement read in part before going on to advise using a mirror or seeking a friend’s help in order to inspect hard-to-reach areas, perhaps even utilizing a stethoscope to hear cacophonic howls developing in suspect areas. “Often, it’s nothing—just something relatively benign, say, a run-of-the-mill damned spirit trapped between the layers of your skin and moaning in pain. However, if it’s a tormented soul whose hell-flensed visage gnaws its way out of a suppurating boil on your lower back and shrieks in agony while biting its own lips to ribbons, that’s something you should get looked at.” The statement also noted that anyone who detects a withered, hollow-eyed little girl protruding from their midsection and singing nursery rhymes in an echoing whisper should immediately seek professional help."
Nutritionists Recommend Increasing Intake Of Whatever Will Earn You Free T-Shirt From Restaurant,4/12/18,1336,"STORRS, CT—Researchers at the University of Connecticut’s Nutritional Sciences Department released a statement Thursday recommending Americans increase their intake of whatever food will earn them a free T-shirt. “Whether the meal required for nutritional and sartorial lifestyle supplementation be a five-pound hamburger, a five-gallon bucket of hot wings, or 500 shrimp, we strongly advise that Americans consume an amount of novelty foodstuffs adequate to earn a free T-shirt upon finishing their oversized portion,” said professor Lucille Jenkins, who noted the manifold proven benefits corresponding to the increased consumption of 54-inch pizzas, 72-ounce steaks, or 21-scoop ice cream sundaes, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of T-shirts proclaiming and commemorating one’s gustatorial accomplishments. “We find that it would be in all Americans’ best interests to not only consume foods with monikers such as ‘The King Kong Cheesesteak’ or ‘The Big Bad Bacon Bomb,’ but to do so within restaurant-prescribed time limits, as not doing so will result in subjects not only having to pay for their meal, but doing so without receiving a commemorative garment.” The nutritionists went on to recommend that Americans only vomit after having finished their meal so as not to be disqualified from taking home their prize."
Study Finds Eating Doctor After Birth Can Provide Essential Nutrients To New Mothers,4/06/18,1130,"HOUSTON—Emphasizing the practice’s many health benefits, a new study released Friday by the Baylor College of Medicine found that new mothers who ate their doctor after birth were able to reabsorb many essential nutrients and minerals lost during the delivery process. “Among women who had just gone through labor, those who chose to immediately ingest their ob-gyn saw their body’s iron, calcium, and protein levels recover at rates much faster than those who did not,” said lead researcher Linda Kalb, who noted that those who also consumed a small fraction of their medical team, even an attending nurse, experienced fewer instances of postpartum depression on average and enjoyed marked improvements in mother–infant bonding. “While it’s certainly not for everyone, and actively frowned upon in certain communities, many women say that they find it both primal and empowering to eat their delivering physician. As it’s grown in popularity, we’ve even seen mothers start the process as early as in the hospital room.” Kalb added that research on the topic remains fairly new, and most doctors remain highly opposed to the idea."
Exercising Woman Really Starting To Feel The Burn Of Lifelong Injury Developing,4/06/18,1113,"RALEIGH, NC—Expressing excitement at the long-term benefits of her new workout routine, exercising woman Brianna Newton reported Friday that she was really beginning to feel the burn of a lifelong injury developing. “Oh, yeah—I’m definitely starting to feel some results [from my repeated misuse of the treadmill and poor running technique],” said Newton, pausing to increase the treadmill’s incline by several more inches before proceeding with the daily jogging routine that will leave her with chronic Achilles tendonitis before age 40. “I’ve really been pushing myself [past the point of irreversible tendon damage] lately, but I know the results will be worth really focusing to go as hard as I can. Sometimes it hurts, but I’m not going to give up [until I inevitably tear my ACL and require major surgery to graft new tissue at the site where my shredded ligament tore away from the bone, leaving me on crutches for several months and limiting my mobility for the rest of my life].” At press time, Newton had taken a quick break to stretch out her arms and shoulders before resuming an intense leg workout."
Gynecologists Recommend Taking Time Off Between IUDs To Allow Body To Expel Backlogged Periods,4/05/18,1065,"ROCHESTER, MN—In an effort to promote optimal women’s health, gynecologists at the Mayo Clinic recommended Thursday taking time off between IUDs to allow the body to expel backlogged periods. “We advise that before inserting a new Mirena or Liletta, a woman should give her body a break to flush out the months upon months of blood and mucosal tissue that have been steadily building up inside her,” said Dr. Nancy Windus, noting that after the removal of the old intrauterine device, a woman’s body naturally begins to slough off the roughly five dozen uterine linings festering within her. “Allowing all that stagnant blood to release is essential to gynecological health and gives the uterus a chance to recover from the approximately 60 menstruations it’s been waiting to discharge. Furthermore, it’s always better to begin a new birth control regimen with a fresh, unclogged endometrium.” Gynecologists also confirmed that while IUDs are highly effective, in rare circumstances, it is possible for all five years worth of accumulated eggs to become fertilized."
Report: Snoring May Increase Risk Of Having Throat Slit During Night By Loved One,3/21/18,1363,"BOSTON—Emphasizing the detrimental health effects of nocturnal respiratory sound generation on sufferers, a report released Wednesday by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital found that snoring may increase one’s risk of having their throats cut ear to ear during the night by loved ones. “Our results appear to indicate that those who snore, whether that be mild wheezing or loud, arrhythmic snorting, incur heightened risks of getting their jugular slashed in the middle of the night by family members,” said lead author Dr. Alan Ballard, who stressed that, if left untreated, snorers were more likely to have their neck sliced open by someone they loved trying to get a quiet night’s rest. “Although it might seem as if the most dangerous side effects of snoring are chronic fatigue, heart disease, and diabetes, new evidence suggests that the dangers of having one’s carotid artery severed in a fit of rage grew significantly in the long run. In some of the more severe cases of chronic sleep apnea we saw, subjects even exhibited signs of their windpipe being repeatedly stabbed by exhausted children who were trying to sleep across the hall.” Ballard added that the health hazards of snoring compounded with age, citing a related study in which several long-time snorers had those close to them suddenly snap and cleanly behead them with a meat axe."
CDC Rolls Out Fleet Of Narcan Biplanes To Fumigate Opioid-Ravaged Small Towns,3/12/18,1213,"ATLANTA—As part of its ongoing campaign to combat the epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled out a new fleet of Narcan-equipped biplanes Monday to fumigate opioid-ravaged small towns nationwide. “It’s become obvious that half measures will not remedy this crisis, so the next step is for CDC aircraft to spray communities decimated by addiction with atomized opioid blockers,” said acting CDC director Anne Schuchat, adding that every one of the Boeing-Stearman Model 75 biplanes purchased by the agency has been retrofitted with 800-gallon aerosol canisters capable of dispersing enough Narcan to restart the hearts of every man, woman, and child in the United States roughly 28 times. “We’ll be dropping Narcan over residential neighborhoods, parks, alleyways, schools—any conceivable place where opioid abuse or overdose may occur. Our goal is to run these biplanes continuously, replenishing fuel and Narcan midair when possible. Hopefully, this will enable us to administer aerial applications of the opiate antidote every few minutes.” At press time, CDC officials were troubled by incoming reports that millions of citizens across the nation had already become addicted to the gas."
Health Insurance CEO Reveals Key To Company’s Success Is Not Paying For Customers’ Medical Care,3/05/18,1302,"HARTFORD, CT—During a panel presentation about his company’s recent 76 percent quarterly profit spike, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini disclosed Monday that the key to increasing earnings in an era of ballooning costs continues to hinge on not paying for customers’ medical care. “The secret to running a thriving multi-billion-dollar company like Aetna is in the cultivation of a loyal consumer base whose medical needs you rarely, if ever, pay for,” said Bertolini, who went on to advise young entrepreneurs to first build financial reserves through a business model in which subscribers spend an exorbitant amount each month for prescriptions, doctor visits, and surgical procedures, and then preserve their capital by exercising all due diligence and consistency by never paying for expensive, profit-deflating exigencies such as prescriptions, doctor visits, and surgical procedures. “If you want broad profit margins in today’s constricted marketplace, all you need to do is find a market which you can offer absolutely nothing while taking all of your customers’ money. That describes today’s modern health insurance market to an uncanny degree—In 2017, our largest customer-facing expense was advertising.” At press time, Aetna’s stock value rose by 6 percent as the company announced a premium hike.

23AndMe Forensic Kit Informs Customer What Crimes He’s Committed,3/02/18,1083,"FRESNO, CA—Marveling at how a tiny bit of DNA could provide so much information about a person, local man Travis Fleming told sources Friday that he had recently learned what crimes he committed thanks to the 23AndMe forensic kit. “I spit into the vial they provided, shipped it off to the 23AndMe forensic lab, and then six weeks later I received the results outlining my exact culpability in all sorts of illegal acts,” said Fleming, scrolling through the online genetic report linking him to burglaries, kidnappings, and homicides. “It’s so cool to see my entire criminal history laid out so clearly. The test was able to pinpoint the exact locations of where I committed arson, plus it told me the likelihood that I’ll strike again in the future. I found out I’m at a higher risk of carrying out an assault with intent to cause bodily harm than the general population, so I’ll have to watch out for that as I get older.” Fleming, who already knew a lot of the information contained in the report, was astonished to learn that he was 1 percent responsible for the Mỹ Lai Massacre."
Hardened White Blood Cell No Longer Hesitates To Kill Viruses,2/28/18,1030,"TEMPE, AZ—While acknowledging that patrolling the human body was at times both stressful and dangerous, a lone white blood cell long hardened by its repeated violent contact with influenza, papilloma, and the common cold acknowledged Wednesday that it no longer hesitates to kill viruses. “When I come across a strain of rhinovirus, for instance, or maybe rotavirus, I attack first and ask questions later,” said the 3-day-old leukocyte, adding that it had seen “a lot of shit go down” during its time in the lymphatic system and no longer questioned or even thought about the split-second decision to absorb enemy pathogens. “The idea of murdering some germ used to tear me up inside, but when I lost a couple hundred thousand friends to diarrhea I realized it’s either us or them. You show one of those fuckers any mercy and they get into decent cells and start replicating their genome. Well, not on my watch.” As of press time, the white blood cell was making its way to the larynx to investigate reports of a scratchy throat."
Report: Americans Waste Enough Food Each Year To Give Over 1 Billion Third World Residents Diabetes,2/26/18,1215,"ROME—According to a report released Monday by the United Nations, U.S. consumers waste roughly 50 million tons of sugar-saturated food each year, a quantity sufficient to give over one billion residents of the developing world Type 2 diabetes. “Citizens in more affluent nations such as the United States do not fully appreciate what the uneaten tons of cookies, candy, ice cream, and pastries they discard could mean to the pancreatic function of the world’s impoverished peoples,” said Food and Agriculture Organization Director General José Graziano da Silva, who noted that the amount of duck sauce packets thrown away annually in the New York metropolitan area could provide more than 600,000 sub-Saharan Africans with severe cases of gout. “And when you factor in the volume of sugary sodas and fruit drinks they throw from their car windows, you begin to see how many of the world’s poor could be stricken with hyperglycemia if only Americans managed their food supply better.” Da Silva added that while American junk food distributors had made great strides in recent years, the dependence of emerging nations on fruits, vegetables, and grains meant they were only beginning to close the global obesity gap."

Survey: Genital Stimulation Maintains Popularity,2/21/18,1234,"BETHESDA, MD— Admitting they were unable to recall a survey even remotely so one-sided, researchers from the National Institutes of Health released comprehensive data Wednesday affirming that the practice of genital stimulation continues to enjoy almost universal popularity. “We can say, with absolute confidence, that the population is nearly unanimous in its delight concerning the vigorous rubbing, massaging, and manipulation of its collective genitals,” said Dr. Rajiv Bhattar, noting that support for result-driven contact with penises and vaginas has remained strong across all ages, genders, and religious backgrounds for at least the past 130 years. “Naturally, styles and techniques have changed somewhat; for instance, baby boomers expressed a fondness for energetic patting or tapping of the genitals, whereas younger generations seemed to prefer sustained physical or even electrical stimulation of their private parts. Bottom line, though, everyone really loves it.” While the authors of the study admitted they had yet to identify all the complex and involved reasons why humans exhibit such robust desire for genital stimulation, the team expressed strong interest in working on the question for as long as necessary."

Otherwise, the blahs can worsen into a general sense of cruddiness or suddenly getting all sad, which, of course, is far more difficult to address.” At press time, the CDC had ordered a quarantine of 43 million Americans who reported one of those things where you just want to go home, get in bed, and not really do anything.

I mean, maybe I can strike a balance by answering truthfully any direct questions she asks but not volunteering any information on my own.” At press time, Bowers was mentally calculating the precise amount of information she would have to divulge in order to obtain powerful prescription antibiotics."
"Researchers Say That First Warning Sign Of Alcoholism Generally Driving Over Curb, Plowing Through Fire Hydrant, And Crashing Into Aquarium",1/22/18,1338,"ATHENS, OH—According to a three-year study published Friday by researchers at the University of Ohio, the first warning sign of alcoholism is usually driving over a curb, plowing through a fire hydrant, and crashing into an oversized aquarium. “That data strongly suggest that the earliest indication you may have a dependence on alcohol is when your car lurches onto the sidewalk, goes flying through the plate glass window of a pet store, and comes to a rest sticking halfway out of a shattered fish tank,” said lead researcher Brian Towsen, adding that most participants in the study first acknowledged they might have a drinking problem while watching gallons of water and aquarium rocks pour in through their car’s broken windshield. “In the majority of cases, subjects still remained unaware of their alcohol abuse even as they burst through the wooden exit arm of a parking garage at full speed and flipped their car on a concrete barricade—but by the time they were peeling sea urchins off of their shirts while floating in a 1,000-gallon saltwater habitat with angel fish circling their feet, almost 90 percent had made a decision to seek help.” The study also found that the first sign of a cocaine addiction was usually breaking both legs while attempting to leap from a third-story balcony into a jacuzzi during a hotel party."

This includes panoramas and vistas, as well as any and all shapes, patterns, and colors.” At press time, a frustrated Wahlberg had been forced to reschedule her surgery after gorging on an entire sunset."
Follow-Up Tests Confirm President Trump’s 19 Other Personalities Also Perfectly Healthy,1/17/18,1180,"WASHINGTON—After yesterday’s announcement that the president received a perfect score on his cognitive assessment, White House physician Ronny L.

Even 3-year-old Jacky demonstrated the clarity and intellectual fitness required to handle the presidency.” At press time, however, Jackson reported the emergence of a volatile Fred Trump personality, which was in a constant state of agitation and which left the president exhausted long after it returned control of his mind."
Study Finds Goosebumps Caused By Psychotic Weirdo Masturbating To Old Photo Of You,1/08/18,1360,"CHICAGO—A groundbreaking new study published Monday in The Journal Of The American Medical Association has found that goosebumps appear on the skin when a mentally unhinged weirdo is, at that very same moment, masturbating to an old photograph of you. “After poring over the evidence, we’ve discovered that the mechanism behind the involuntary response commonly referred to as goosebumps is indeed a carbuncle-covered freak jerking off to a photo of you from the seventh grade,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Daniel Leahy, whose research suggests that the more numerous the goosebumps, the more vigorously the decrepit lunatic is pleasuring himself to snapshots of you moving into your first apartment. “Even something as minor as a gnarled old man leering at a series of photo booth pictures from one of your recent nights out is enough to produce a measurable effect on the skin. So any time you feel the hairs rising on the back of your neck, it is more than likely the case that somewhere out there a hunched-over cackling recluse is clutching one of your prom pictures and bringing himself to shuddering orgasm.” Leahy added that there is no need to worry, as goosebumps usually go away after the shriveled, grotesque man has finished, wiped the ejaculate off your graduation portrait, and placed it back in a shoe box he keeps at the foot of his bed."
Earth’s Successful Completion Of Orbit Around Sun Inspires Woman To Reflect On Eating Habits,1/01/18,1133,"GREENVILLE, NC—Noting that the celestial body’s return to this position in space demanded more personal accountability, sources confirmed Monday that the Earth’s successful completion of an orbit around the sun inspired local woman Vivian Turner to reflect on her eating habits. “Now that the planet I live on has traveled 584 million miles in an elliptical around its star, I’ve decided I need to be healthier and eat less pasta,” said Turner, revealing that the angular momentum from the Earth’s formation pushing it through 365 full rotations on its axis had previously inspired her to save money by bringing lunch from home. “Knowing that we are once again 91,401,983 miles from the sun, I’m going to start making salads too. I also have to make sure I stop late-night snacking for the entire time the Sun’s gravity is holding us in orbit until we return to this distance, I can’t just give up before the Earth’s tilt begins the gradual warming of it’s top half.” At press time, the Earth had not even completed a full rotation since Turner had made her vow to avoid sweets before she was eating a second piece of chocolate cake."
Nation’s Sleep Experts Recommend Cutting Down On Strobe Light Before Bedtime,12/05/17,1032,"WASHINGTON—Saying even 10 minutes of evening exposure can lead to a night of low-quality sleep, the National Sleep Foundation recommended on Tuesday cutting down on strobe lights before bedtime. “Strobe light actually has a pronounced stimulating effect on the brain, so when winding down for the night, it’s best to look directly into it as little possible,” said spokesperson Lisa Mullany, adding that, even when dampened by neon gel filters or the fog from a dry-ice machine, the ultra-bright beams discharging every few milliseconds send a signal to the body’s internal clock that can often disrupt its sleep-wake cycle. “Even something as seemingly harmless as omni-directional moving-head fixtures that alternate between fun geometrical patterns can interfere with your natural melatonin production, in effect wreaking havoc with both the length and quality of sleep.” Mullany also recommended limiting any accompanying EDM and dubstep, whose rapid, thumping beats are also known to upset the body’s natural circadian rhythms."

Nutritionists Recommend 3-4 Daily Servings Of Anything That's About To Go Bad,11/15/17,1097,"ROCHESTER, MN—In an effort to help Americans get the most out of every meal, nutritionists at the Mayo Clinic on Wednesday recommended three to four daily servings of anything that’s about to go bad. “Having found many American diets severely lacking in food on the borderline of being expired, we’re now suggesting three to four servings each day of items such as leftovers that have maybe one more night left in them,” said researcher Gail McLeod, adding that appropriately altering one’s diet could be as simple as eating cereal with milk that smells sort of funky but was still probably okay and topping it with slices of iffy, but still technically edible, overripe banana. “You don’t have to turn your eating patterns upside down. Just make a habit of dipping chips in browned guacamole that’s likely decent once you scrape off the top, or mix in some wilted, limp lettuce along with other greens in your salad.” McLeod went on to say, however, that moderation was still essential and that fresh bread should be consumed in addition to bread with the blue-green mold sliced off of the crust."
White House Announces Obamacare Exchange Now Only Accessible From Single Kiosk In Remote Iowa Cornfield,11/03/17,1438,"WASHINGTON—Stating that the new system is pursuant with the regulations laid out by the Affordable Care Act, the White House announced Friday that the government’s health insurance exchanges would now only be accessible from a single kiosk in a remote Iowa cornfield. “All Americans wishing to sign up for health insurance through the marketplace will now be able to do so by accessing a terminal conveniently located in the middle of a 60-acre cornfield just two hours North of Des Moines,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that the lone kiosk, which stands among the tall corn stalks about 2,000 yards off an unmarked road, would be open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the shortened enrollment period for anyone seeking to procure health coverage for 2018. “One kiosk centrally located in the United States will streamline the process of accessing the marketplace while also cutting costs. In just 135 paces northeast from the old tree stump in the middle of the field, you’ll be able to peruse the insurance options available for you and your family, except between noon and 3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the system undergoes scheduled maintenance. We recommend signing up early for those who live out of state as flights to Des Moines are limited.” At press time, sources confirmed that the new health exchange kiosk was currently out of order after being run over by a combine harvester."

Jesus, we’ve got to get you off of this nightshade-free diet right away. Quick, you need to start eating bread and potatoes.

 To become more mindful of how much you’re eating, try breathing between bites
 Instead of taking the car for short trips, consider walking, or at least rolling
 Try to squeeze into your old wedding dress, tear it a little bit, and then sit and cry with it halfway up your hips
 Don’t get discouraged if you slip up with your diet—just start fresh in a year or so

OB-GYN Kind Of Annoyed She Has To Confirm Woman’s Premonition About Sex Of Baby That Came To Her In Dream,10/26/17,920,"GAINESVILLE, VA—Cursing under her breath while examining the ultrasound image, area ob-gyn Dr. Geena McDyer was reportedly kind of annoyed Thursday that she had to confirm her patient’s premonition about the sex of her baby that came to her in a dream. “I don’t want to see her smug expression when I tell her she’s right and validate her belief that she’s somehow psychically in tune with her unborn child,” said McDyer, adding that the mother-to-be would have a 50 percent chance of getting the gender correct just by “flipping a fucking coin.” “Even if I lied to her to wipe that expectant grin off her face, she’d ultimately find out she was right when she had the kid, and then she’d believe her stupid dream was powerful enough to overcome modern medicine.” At press time, the patient’s stunned silence seemed to indicate her premonition had not foreseen any of the birth defects McDyer was currently pointing out."
Report: Suddenly Remembering To Sit Up Straight Once A Month Best Way To Keep Back Healthy Into Old Age,10/25/17,1218,"BALTIMORE—Saying the simple practice was hugely beneficial for staving off aches and pains later in life, a report released Wednesday by Johns Hopkins University found that suddenly remembering to sit up straight once a month is the best way to keep a back healthy into old age. “Our research determined that the ideal method for achieving lasting back health is to remember seemingly out of nowhere to correct your posture at a random moment during the day, involuntarily resume slouching after a few minutes, and then repeat the process within the next four weeks or so,” said lead author Jackson Hartig, adding that neither strengthening exercises nor stretching routines were even remotely as helpful. “Those who suddenly remember to sit up straight less often than once a month can expect to deal with chronic discomfort as they grow older, while people who rarely if ever have those spontaneous moments of awareness will likely have to contend with agonizing muscle spasms and a pronounced hunch from middle age until death.” Hartig went on to say that the sitting up must be prompted unconsciously and that deliberate reminders such as a sticky note taped to a computer monitor at work had no effect whatsoever."
"Frantic, Last-Second Study Finds Old-Fashioned Donut Better For You Than Bavarian Cream",10/24/17,953,"ROCHESTER, MN—Planning, conducting, and publishing the entire study while hovering over a box of freshly baked pastries, hurried researchers at the Mayo Clinic released new findings on Tuesday confirming that old-fashioned donuts were a healthier option than Bavarian Cream varieties. “Yes, definitely, we conclude that a classic donut is, in fact, better for you,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Paul Lawton, moving his hand over both styles of donut and determining that the non-filled one had 5 percent fewer calories and maybe even more nutrients due to the light dusting of cinnamon on top. “In addition, you know, there’s a hole in the middle, so that surely means it has less saturated fat. And the chocolate in the batter is a superfood, so there might actually be some positive benefits to consuming it.” Moments later, researchers released a follow-up study showing there actually wasn’t much of a difference so you could probably have both."
Nutritious Lunch Brought From Home Broadcasts Middle-Aged Coworker’s Recent Health Scare Loud And Clear,10/24/17,1021,"CINCINNATI—In what could not be a more obvious attempt to improve his physical condition, a nutritious lunch brought from home by middle-aged coworker Phil Schutt broadcast his recent health scare loud and clear, sources reported Monday. “Wow, Phil must have had a real shock to bring that steamed fish and spinach for lunch,” said coworker Josh Leibman, noticing clear as day how quickly Schutt switched from going out for greasy burritos and bacon burgers to packing a small tupperware container of quinoa salad. “The only explanation is that he got some really bad news from his doctor that made him realize he needed to get his act together in a hurry. You see him snacking on a Ziploc bag of carrot sticks instead of getting his usual two bags of Fritos from the vending machine, and you just know he’s freaking out about wanting to be around to see his kids grow up.” At press time, Schutt’s decision to pass up leftover donuts in the break room cemented suspicions that he probably would’ve been dead in two weeks."
Report: Breathing Can Extend Lifespan By Several Decades,10/05/17,960,"ROCKVILLE, MD—Touting the numerous health benefits of performing the activity on a regular basis, a report released Thursday by the National Institutes of Health found that breathing can extend a person’s lifespan by several decades. “Our research clearly shows that, if started early enough and performed properly, respiration can potentially help a person live for 80 years or more,” said lead author Jacob Hamlin, adding that the data confirmed the enormous long-term benefit of breathing, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or family history. “Steady inhaling, when combined with equal parts exhaling, is incredibly good for your lungs and promotes healthy brain function. Conversely, however, we found that missing even one day of breathing can drastically reduce an otherwise healthy person’s life expectancy.” Hamlin went on to say that breathing is not a magic solution and works best as part of a lifestyle that includes eating food and drinking fluids."
Arguments For And Against Single Payer Healthcare,9/27/17,1282,"Bernie Sanders recently introduced a single payer healthcare plan, also known as medicare-for-all, that would guarantee coverage to all Americans under one government-run plan. Here are the arguments for and against implementing a single-payer healthcare plan.

Vanderbilt Chancellor Recommends Fans Get Vaccinated Before SEC Road Schedule Begins,9/21/17,1160,"NASHVILLE, TN—Stressing the importance of the fan base’s health and wellbeing, Vanderbilt University chancellor Nicholas Zeppos advised Commodore football fans Thursday to get vaccinated before the team’s Southeastern Conference road schedule begins next week. “Those of you travelling into parts of the country like Gainesville, Oxford, or Columbia will be exposing yourself to a wide array of diseases and viruses, and we strongly urge you to consult with your doctor and ensure your immunizations are up to date prior to the start of SEC play,” Zeppos said in an email to Vanderbilt students, faculty, and alumni, urging them to carefully consider the risks before choosing to attend any conference road games. “Whether you’re traveling into the East or West division, adequate precautions are vital. In the event you or your healthcare provider are unable to take the proper steps towards vaccination, we ask that you remain home for your own safety and that of the entire Vanderbilt community.” The advisory concluded by reminding fans that anyone planning on attending a road game tailgate should visit the Student Health Center for free typhoid tablets."

Flesh-Eating Bacteria Wishing It Hadn’t Filled Up On Foot,8/07/17,703,"RICHMOND, VA—Expressing regret over stuffing itself so early in the meal, a local flesh-eating bacterium was reportedly wishing Monday that it hadn’t filled up so much on foot. “Oh, god, I just started pigging out on that delicious heel wound, and I guess I didn’t realize how much necrotic tissue I was scarfing down,” said the microorganism Pseudomonas, lamenting that it was way too full to even enjoy the pair of mouthwatering calves. “This always happens. I just go to town on one appendage and leave no room to finish the rest of the body. I really need to learn better impulse control.” At press time, the bacterium was comforted by the fact that it could save some of that tasty bicep for later."
Mosquito Confronts Partner After Testing Positive For Zika,7/13/17,758,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Lashing out at her significant other the moment he arrived home at their stagnant puddle of water, an Aedes aegypti mosquito angrily confronted her partner Thursday after testing positive for the Zika virus. “Listen, you’re my only mate, so if I have Zika it’s because you fucking bred with another female who had it,” said the 12-day-old insect, adding that because of her mate’s betrayal, she was now deeply worried about the possibility of spawning hundreds of offspring with microcephaly. “It’s bad enough you cheated, but then you went and brought that whore’s disease home to me? How could you?” Despite her anger, the mosquito went on to say that while it would be difficult, she wasn’t yet ready to give up on the 72-hour relationship."
"Gaunt, Sickly Kirby Takes Leave Of Absence From Video Games Following Stomach Cancer Diagnosis",7/12/17,1363,"DREAM LAND—With large bags under his oval-shaped eyes and his skin a pallid shade of bubblegum pink, a gaunt, sickly Kirby announced Wednesday that he would be taking a leave of absence from video games after being diagnosed with stomach cancer. “After a biopsy by Dr. Mario discovered a series of tumors along my gastrointestinal tract, I received a diagnosis of stage IV stomach cancer and will be taking an immediate and indefinite hiatus from all fighting, puzzle, and racing games,” said the pink puff, his voice frail as he explained that the tests from HAL Laboratory attributed the diagnosis to complications from frequently inhaling oversized enemies, eating over 40,000 calories of junk food—including whole hams, pizzas, and cakes—on a daily basis, and inflating his stomach to serve as a buoyant flight device. “I was so focused on obtaining all the Crystal Shards and ridding Mirror World of Shadow Kirby, I didn’t realize how much I was neglecting my health. I wish it hadn’t gotten to this point before I fully understood that I should cut back on shooting fireballs out of my mouth or maybe take it easy with the Maxim Tomatoes.” At press time, King Dedede and Meta Knight had issued a joint statement saying they would not hatch any diabolical schemes on Planet Pop Star out of respect for their ailing colleague and wished him a speedy recovery."
"Study Finds Only 1 In 3 Lasik Surgeries End In Laser Boring Through Eye, Incinerating Brain, Shooting Through Skull On Other Side",6/26/17,1355,"CHICAGO—Assuaging concerns about the safety of the corrective eye treatment, a study published Monday in The Journal Of The American Medical Association found that only 1 in 3 Lasik surgeries end in the laser boring through the eyes, incinerating the brain, and shooting through the skull on the other side. “Our research found that the fears of people considering a Lasik procedure were generally exaggerated, with only one-third experiencing a searing beam of light that drills through their eyeball, reduces their brain to cinders, and then bursts through the back of their head,” said lead author Dr. Roger Cardenas, noting that apprehensions about the likelihood of having the contents of one’s brain instantly vaporized often overshadowed the fact that roughly 66 percent of patients who underwent Lasik enjoyed greatly improved vision. “This isn’t to say there is no risk, however, and people should weigh the benefits of never again having to wear glasses or contacts against the possibility that the laser will puncture their retina, liquify all their cerebral matter, explode through their head, and continue straight through the wall behind them.” Cardenas also clarified that Lasik surgery was different from cataract surgery, which uses suction to remove the clouded-over lens and which vacuums up both eyes and the nose nearly half the time."
New Study Finds No Long-Term Health Benefits,6/19/17,716,"PRINCETON, NJ—In the most comprehensive research of its kind, a new study released Monday by Princeton University found no long-term health benefits. “Flying in the face of conventional wisdom, our results clearly show no lasting positive impact on overall health,” said lead author Michelle Kessler, adding that the data also clearly points toward no enduring improvement in longevity, stamina, or the ability to sleep. “In fact, across all demographic groups, we not only discovered no sustained increase in overall wellness, but also indications that the adverse effects may in fact greatly outweigh the advantages.” Kessler went on to say that even the short-term benefits might be wildly exaggerated themselves."
Family Hesitant About Sinking Another 40 Grand Into Repairs Of Dilapidated Old Grandma,6/05/17,951,"CALDWELL, ID—Conceding that she just might not be worth the expense at this point, the Smith family told reporters Monday that they were hesitant about sinking another $40,000 of repairs into their dilapidated old grandmother. “I hate to say it, but we might just be throwing money away on the old girl,” said her son Lawrence Smith, explaining that they’ve already sunk $15,000 into her hip and another $5,000 into her hearing and would hate to put even more money into her only to have her break down a week after they picked her up from the hospital. “We can’t get her a mile out before she overheats, stalls, and has to be restarted. She leaks all the time now too, not to mention the weird sounds she keeps making. Honestly, it might be better to just let her keep going as long as she can until she naturally stops running for good.” Smith went on to say that the family’s money might be much better spent on investing in a brand-new grandchild."
"Yellow Cross Receives Record 10,000 Liters Of Urine Donations",5/31/17,988,"NEW YORK—Saying they were elated with the number of people who took time out of their day to relieve themselves for a good cause, officials at the Yellow Cross announced Wednesday that the organization received a record 10,000 liters of urine during its annual spring donation drive. “We are beyond thrilled by the generosity of urine donors across the country who helped break the record set last year by an incredible 27 percent,” said Yellow Cross director Ted Finely, adding that it seemed like everywhere he went, he saw donors proudly wearing “I Donated!” stickers featuring the splashy yellow droplet. “But as successful as this urine drive was, there’s always a need for more. Donating urine doesn’t hurt, and best of all, you’ll feel proud that your excretion helped people—and, remember, the next person to need urine from the Yellow Cross could be you.” Finely went on to say that while all types of urine were welcome, pale yellow and amber were always particularly in demand."
Republican Congressman Terrifies Constituents Even More By Assuring Them He Read Every Part Of Healthcare Bill,5/05/17,974,"WASHINGTON—Hours after casting his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with the GOP-authored American Health Care Act, Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) reportedly terrified his constituents even further Friday by assuring them he had read every word of the newly passed healthcare bill. “I made sure to read the AHCA bill line by line before I went up to the rostrum to vote Yea,” said Amash in a chilling statement, which according to reports caused the blood to drain from the faces of all 700,000 constituents of his Western Michigan district. “After acquainting myself with each of the provisions of this new bill and carefully reviewing every section, I was able to make the [extremely frightening] decision to support it. I think it’s important to be informed on the issues.” At press time, residents of Michigan’s 3rd district were reportedly frozen in fear after Amash stated that he would be displeased if the Senate voted to remove any parts of the bill."
Tips For Not Condemning Millions Of Americans To Sickness And Death,5/05/17,4011,"As the debate over Obamacare rages on and insurance costs continue to rise, Americans consider how best to improve the country’s healthcare system. Here are the The Onion’s tips for not condemning millions of Americans to sickness and death: Read the thing you’re voting on, particularly if you’ve heard someone mention that it might end up killing millions of people. Do your research: Find out if any of the people you are paid to represent are human beings who use healthcare. Try to better understand the concerns of your constituents by dying a slow, painful death while bankrupting your entire family. See if you can recall any reason besides an all-consuming sense of self-importance and knee-jerk lust for personal financial gain that might once have motivated you to seek public office. Check whether or not a single medical professional, patient advocate, economist, or literally anyone familiar with the subject in question supports the legislation you’re about to vote in favor of. If respect for human life doesn’t interest you, try to remember that sick and indigent people are, at this point, still legally allowed to vote. Acknowledge that serving in public office sometimes means putting aside your personal beliefs about how all poor people deserve to die in a wet ditch. Consider going through the millions of years of natural selection and incremental evolutionary advancements necessary to develop a rudimentary backbone. Find the nearest mirror; look in the mirror; check to see if you are a greasy, entitled fuck. Definitely avoid being Bradley Byrne, Martha Roby, Mike D. Rogers, Robert B.

Nation’s Back Alleys Working To Expand Available Services In Anticipation Of Trumpcare Bill Becoming Law,5/04/17,4398,"WASHINGTON—Preparing for a surge in business from the millions of Americans who could soon be left without access to medical care, the nation’s back alleys were reportedly rushing to expand their services Thursday in anticipation of the American Health Care Act becoming law. Sources from back alleys in every state confirmed that as soon as the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill known as Trumpcare, their filth-strewn, sidestreet-based facilities began scrambling to add personnel and expand into nearby shuttered warehouses and vacant lots in order to meet the increased demand for services expected from low-income families, elderly Americans, individuals with pre-existing conditions, and others who will have decreased access to health coverage. “We’re gonna have thousands of people coming through here soon, and right now we’re just not ready for them,” said Durham, NC man Curtis Hendershaw, who spoke from a narrow alleyway behind the Dragon Inn Chinese restaurant, adding that he had already begun making calls to all the unlicensed physicians and disgraced former medical professionals he knows. “We’re used to stitching a guy up here and there, but as soon as insurers can drop essential benefits and impose annual payment caps, we’ll be doing all sorts of major surgeries, pediatric services, mental health treatment, you name it.” “I just put some cardboard down under that fire escape there so we can have a dry place for a neonatal unit,” he continued. According to reports, back alleys around the country have begun to upgrade their facilities, hauling in additional soiled twin mattresses to increase the number of available beds, shoveling out rodent carcasses to create makeshift waiting areas, and diverting drainpipes from adjacent buildings so amateur practitioners have a supply of rusty water to scrub their hands with before performing appendectomies. The demand is expected to be so great that the back alleys are reportedly planning to offer a wide array of medical services, with each darkened, grimy corner of the nation’s empty back streets and abandoned industrial parks focusing on specialized areas, such as emergency care, geriatrics, labor and delivery, prescription drug dispensing, or outpatient amputation procedures. “This is a huge change for us, because we’ve been scaling back for the past six or seven years, and now all of a sudden we have to undergo a major expansion so we can meet the needs of a large section of the community,” said Don Chalmers, 51, who works in a back alley behind a parking garage several blocks from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. “We’ve lost a lot of business to that hospital up the street, but with this new bill cutting Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars and eliminating the employer mandate, a lot of people will be walking right out those doors and right into the ICU we’re setting up in the back of this old burnt-out van over here.” “It’s not that bad, though, really,” he continued. “As soon as your procedure’s finished we lay you down under a bridge where you’re welcome to rest up as long as you need to.” Chalmers went on to state that he had even further expansion plans for the future, gesturing toward a nearby dumpster, which he said he was hoping to set up as a hospice unit. Additionally, he said he had found a dental assistant with access to oral painkillers who told him she could help out with addicts who, if the 2010 Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced, will no longer be able to afford methadone or addiction treatment. Speaking with reporters, several Americans who stand to lose their health insurance under Trumpcare expressed their gratitude that the nation’s back alleys were expanding to meet their needs. “I have three young children, so it’s good to know that a place like this is here, just off of Cottman Avenue, beyond all the truck loading docks,” 41-year-old Laura Williams said as she watched a broken leg being reset in an alley behind a Northeast Philadelphia check-cashing facility. “This is great news for my mom, too, who’s starting to get on in years. It’s not that convenient; I had to take three buses to get here and then climb through a hole in a chain-link fence. But at least it’s something my family can afford.” “Considering how busy these places are about to get, I just hope they’ll be able to fit us in,” Williams added."
Mom Figures It About Time To Sit Down Adolescent Daughter And Explain How Weight Watchers Points Work,5/03/17,1320,"BOTHELL, WA—Saying she wanted the 13-year-old to get the right information straight from her, area mom Karen Winston told reporters Wednesday that it was probably about time to sit down with her adolescent daughter and explain how Weight Watchers points work. “I know it’s not the most comfortable thing to talk about with your mom, but she’s gotten to that point in her life where she just needs to know exactly how many points a cereal bar counts as,” said Winston, adding that she wanted to have a frank conversation with her daughter Emma about the four components of SmartPoints so that she could make her own informed choices once she started doing Weight Watchers. “I don’t want her making decisions based on stuff she hears at school or sees online, because I’m worried she’ll get the wrong idea about how to reach her target weight or, God forbid, do something stupid like eyeball her portion sizes instead of measuring them. I really just want to make sure Emma has a positive, healthy attitude about Weight Watchers, because she’ll have to deal with the consequences of the decisions she makes now for the rest of her life.” Winston went on to say that she hoped to avoid the mistake she made with her eldest daughter, Ashley, who never received the Weight Watchers points talk and ended up getting fat at 17."
Man Holding Hands With Pregnant Woman Must Have Weird Fetish,4/24/17,817,"RED BANK, NJ—Testing the limits of what even the most progressive onlookers considered publicly acceptable, a man was seen by multiple witnesses Tuesday holding hands with a visibly pregnant woman in what many could only interpret as the expression of a bizarre fetish. “Man, he must really get off on that,” said 29-year-old warehouse manager Thomas Alden, looking askance as the smiling man walked down the sidewalk making no attempt to conceal the fact that he was gently squeezing the pregnant woman’s fingers. “I mean, if you’re into that, I guess more power to—oh, gross. Now he’s rubbing her belly. He’s just flaunting it now. What a complete fucking freak.” At press time, the woman had been asked when she was due by a kind elderly passerby who observers presumed was part of the same bizarre kink community."
"Friends, Family Waiting For Current Bout Of Man’s Depression To Subside Before Really Laying Into Him",4/17/17,941,"ST. CLOUD, MN—Fearing that in his current state he was too fragile to withstand the harsh criticism they wished to level at him, friends and family of area man Todd Freely told reporters Monday that they were waiting for Freely’s most recent bout of depression to subside before they really laid into him. “He’s way too low to hear this now, but once he’s feeling better, I’m really gonna put the screws to him about getting some regular exercise and making an effort to socialize more,” Freely’s best friend Richard Felton said, adding that he planned on “reading him the fucking riot act” about looking for work the minute Freely’s depressive state began to improve. “The moment his symptoms ease up, I’m hitting him with both barrels about getting his debt under control and a whole bunch of other shit.” Others close to Freely, however, told reporters that they couldn’t wait one more minute to let him have it over his personal hygiene."
E.P.T. Clarifies Pregnancy Tests Intended For Entertainment Purposes Only,4/14/17,1087,"TARRYTOWN, NY—In an effort to limit the company’s exposure to unwanted claims or potential liability, e.p.t. issued a statement Friday clarifying that their pregnancy tests are intended for entertainment purposes only. “We would like to make it perfectly clear to our customers that e.p.t. home pregnancy tests are just something fun to pass around at a party with friends, and the results should not be taken seriously,” read the statement from Prestige Brands, which went on to say that the pregnancy tests are purely novelty items designed to amuse and serve no practical purpose. “We encourage users to simply share some laughs while gathered around the test stick, which we want to reiterate should not be construed as a medical opinion of any sort, nor serve as a substitute for a visit to a licensed professional. Please refrain from making any decisions based off the use of our product, as we do not make any guarantees about the test’s accuracy.” According to sources, the press release came in the wake of similar statements from manufacturers of home STD and paternity tests."
Text History With Mom A Succinct Chronology Of Relatives’ Hospital Visits,4/10/17,877,"YERINGTON, NV—Saying the communications ranged from minor procedures to urgent trips to the emergency room, local man Hector Garcia told reporters Monday that his text message history with his mother read as a succinct chronology of all his relatives’ hospital visits. “It’s all here—this is when Grandpa fell and had to be rushed to St. John’s, and there’s when Aunt Gloria got her appendectomy,” said Garcia, scrolling through the texts that indicated the date and time of each trip to the hospital, punctuated with only a few reminders for him to call. “My sister breaking her ankle. And, yup, there’s Grandpa again. You’d probably have to go out as far as third cousins for a hospital visit not to be listed here.” Garcia added that the comprehensive text archive in no way prevented his mother from talking about every one of the hospital visits subsequently on the phone."
Pope Francis Concerned About Infection From Holy Spirit Bite,4/04/17,797,"VATICAN CITY—Roughly 48 hours after being bitten by the Holy Spirit, Pope Francis expressed concern that the wound inflicted by the unveiled Epiphany of God had become infected, Vatican sources reported Tuesday. “The little bastard only nipped me, but now it’s all swollen,” the Pope said, gingerly cradling his tender left arm, which had started to exhibit a pattern of inflamed crucifixes beneath the surface of the skin. “You can’t be too careful around that chippy fucker. I was just trying to feed it, and bam! Took a good chunk out of an archbishop last week, too, and he had to get, like, 30 shots.” The pontiff went on to say he might try dumping the Holy Spirit off at the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople or just leave open the door to St. Peter’s Basilica and hope it runs off."
Woman Who Drinks 6 Cups Of Coffee Per Day Trying To Cut Down On Blue Light At Bedtime,4/04/17,923,"QUINCY, MA—Saying she would stop looking at her phone and tablet at least an hour before going to sleep, local woman Carina Anielski, who drinks six cups of coffee per day, told reporters Tuesday that she was trying to cut down on blue light around bedtime. “I heard that too much blue light can really mess with your circadian rhythm, so I’m going to keep it way down,” said Anielski, who consumes a full 12 ounces of highly caffeinated beverage roughly every two hours between the cup she has upon arriving at work and the cup she consumes after dinner. “I’ve also put a filter on all my devices that blocks out blue light, so I’ve got an added layer of protection. Seriously, one blast of that stuff at the wrong time and I’m wide awake till four in the morning. I have to take some precautions.” At press time, Anielski, who also drinks at least six Diet Cokes every day, was shutting down her laptop promptly at 9 p.m."
Health Scare Prompts Man To Start Overeating Healthier,3/31/17,1128,"ROUND ROCK, TX—Having recently learned from his doctor that he suffered from high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels that put him at serious risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke, 43-year-old Donald Fisher told reporters Thursday the unanticipated health scare had prompted him to start overeating healthier. “This has been a real wake-up call for me, so from now on, I’m sticking to eating only nutritious, low-fat foods well past the point of feeling full,” said Fisher, explaining that he had already cut oversized portions of red meat out of his diet in favor of multiple hulking servings of lean proteins such as fish, beans, and baked chicken. “It’s not going to be easy, but if I can replace my regular afternoon snack of Doritos with a whole bag of organic kale chips and restrict myself to five or six helpings from just the salad bar when I go out to eat at a buffet, I should be okay. I’ve really got to make these big changes; this is my health we’re talking about here.” At press time, Fisher was attempting to slake a late-night bout of hunger with 900 calories’ worth of apples and peanut butter."
Woman Conducting Ongoing Scientific Experiment On Own Skin,3/29/17,845,"DULUTH, MN—Noting her methodic applications of various chemical agents in carefully controlled combinations, sources confirmed Wednesday that local woman Sara Holloway has been carrying out an open-ended scientific experiment on her own skin. “I just got this new moisturizer I’m going to try out,” Holloway, 32, said of the latest phase in the study she has been running for the past 17 years, testing a wide range of hypotheses regarding which synthetic compounds and colloidal solutions might best be employed to attain optimal elasticity, hydration, and smoothness in dermal tissues. “The other stuff was kind of leaving my skin feeling dry. This one looks like it should be good, though.” At press time, reports indicated Holloway was nearing the final stages of an elimination test to determine which depilatory was causing a painful rash."
Woman Devises Latest Delusional Scheme For Burning Extra Calories During Workday,3/22/17,1045,"CHICAGO—Saying it was crucial to find ways to keep fit even within the confines of her office, local woman Diana Shearer devised her latest delusional scheme Wednesday for burning extra calories during the workday. “I’ll start using a smaller water glass—that way I’ll get more walking in because I’ll have to refill it more frequently,” said Shearer, whose fanciful notions of physical activity have also included taking the stairs instead of the elevator, visiting her colleagues in person instead of emailing them, wearing small ankle weights, and replacing her desk chair with an exercise ball. “Let’s say I burn four calories each round trip to the kitchen watercooler. If I make eight trips, that’s 32 extra calories a day, or 160 calories each and every workweek—and that doesn’t even count the five minutes of chair yoga I do after lunch.” In a stroke of mad genius, Shearer reportedly later realized that she could boost the number of calories burned if she walked 20 feet farther to fill her water glass at the cooler in the copy room."
Man Keeping Running Total Of How Many People In Gym In Worse Shape Than Him,3/20/17,908,"ENCINITAS, CA—Intently scanning the room for signs of fatigue or excessive perspiration, local gym member Brian O’Grady reportedly kept a tally Monday of how many people were in worse shape than him. “That guy’s been on the seated bike for like a minute and he’s already out of breath, and that old dude’s doing like 30 pounds on the shoulder press machine—so, yeah, that’s two,” O’Grady thought to himself, leaping suddenly into double digits as he counted 15 people limply moving their arms and legs in a Zumba class. “And I bet I could easily outlast four of these people on the ellipticals, plus two, maybe three on the treadmills—oh, and definitely the guy who’s been on the rower two minutes and could have a heart attack any time now.” At press time, O’Grady had determined that a muscular woman doing numerous weighted pull-ups was a professional athlete of some sort and would not count against him."
Report: Saying ‘Smells Okay’ Precedes 85% Of Foodborne Illnesses Annually,3/15/17,1277,"ATLANTA—Presenting research with significant implications for public health, a report published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that saying the phrase “smells okay” precedes 85 percent of foodborne illnesses in the United States annually. “We analyzed data from thousands of cases involving food-related ailments over the last decade and concluded that most individuals had given a quick once-over to leftovers and uttered some variation of ‘probably still good’ before spending the next several hours suffering intense stomach pain and vomiting,” said Dr. Robert Husted, director of the CDC’s Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, adding that cases of E. coli and botulism had been directly linked to individuals observing that the contaminated food “hasn’t been sitting out for that long.” “In addition, determining that grayish chicken Alfredo simply needed to be stirred or that an improperly covered week-old meatloaf would be fine once an outer layer was cut off almost tripled the chances of contracting salmonella.” The report also confirmed that thousands of Americans across the country are infected with a foodborne illness every year shortly after being asked by a friend or family member to “try this.”"
Queen Elizabeth Rushed To Hospital For Royal Blood Transfusion,3/10/17,870,"LONDON—Saying that Her Highness was now in stable condition, Buckingham Palace representatives announced Thursday that Queen Elizabeth II had been rushed to the hospital early this morning to receive an emergency transfusion of royal blood. “It was a dire situation—there was very little royal blood on hand owing to the relatively small number of donations made by the noble-born,” said Private Secretary to the Sovereign Sir Christopher Geidt, adding that Prince William ultimately donated the blood of royal descent that saved the queen’s life. “Unfortunately, Prince Harry was not a match for Her Majesty, and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton was of no use, being of common parentage.” Geidt went on to say that in the event Queen Elizabeth required another transfusion, three-year-old Prince George would remain readily available to donate as much as was needed."
Man’s Genetic Predisposition For Heart Disease No Match For 10 Half-Assed Push-Ups He Does Couple Times A Week,3/08/17,780,"CHICAGO—Despite afflicting his father and numerous members of his extended family, local man Josh McCalister’s genetic predisposition for heart disease was no match for the 10 half-assed push-ups he does a couple of times a week, sources said Wednesday. “Three…four—ah, Christ—five,” McCalister, 38, said to himself, counting off the short set of poorly executed push-ups that were swiftly undoing the susceptibility to coronary artery disease and arrhythmia that was encoded in his very DNA. “Nine…almost there…nine and a half—agh, close enough—10!” Although the push-ups he currently performed already ensured that he would be spared the deadly disease that had been passed down unimpeded for generations, McCalister had reportedly vowed to get to 20 within the next six months."
Woman Who’s Been On The Pill For Years Thinking About Switching To New Set Of Debilitating Side Effects,3/03/17,1018,"LOUISVILLE, KY—Saying that she had been using birth control pills since she was a teenager, 30-year-old Claudia Spencer told reporters Friday that she was now thinking about switching to an entirely new set of debilitating side effects. “I’ve been having painful cramps from the pill for more than a decade, so I’m thinking there might be an option out there that gives me excruciating migraines instead,” said Spencer, adding that she planned to consult with her doctor because she had heard that NuvaRing might work well at shrinking her libido and making her vomit. “I could also try an IUD, but I’m not sure it’d be worth it if I have to give up the depression I’m already experiencing from the pill just for the risk of a uterine perforation. In the end, I guess it’s just important that I go with the unbearable side effects that are right for me.” Spencer went on to say that while she liked her current anti-anxiety medication, she hoped adjusting her dosage might help completely destroy her ability to sleep."
Surgeon General Recommends Twisting Head Far Enough Until You Hear Little Pop,2/16/17,794,"WASHINGTON—Describing the act as small but incredibly satisfying, U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy urged all Americans Thursday to twist their head far enough until they hear a little pop. “We strongly advise everyone to pivot their head in one direction and just keep going until you hear a good crack,” said Murthy at a press conference, adding that citizens should not just stop there but to make sure to do the other side as well. “It might take a few tries, but you’ll definitely feel a solid pop when it happens. You can put your palm on the bottom of your chin in case you need a little extra push. We also recommend rolling your head around a bit afterward—get it nice and loose.” Murthy later advised Americans, once they’ve twisted their head, to crack all their knuckles one by one."
Mental Illness Determined Not To Let Stigma Of Area Man Define It,2/14/17,970,"ASHEVILLE, NC—Saying it refused to be pigeonholed by widespread misconceptions about its condition, the mental illness of area man Greg Luger told reporters Tuesday that it was determined not to let the societal stigma associated with the 31-year-old define it. “There’s always been a lot of shame associated with Greg,” said Luger’s depressive disorder, adding that until now, it had spent its entire life actively trying to hide the fact that it suffers from Greg and convincing itself that Greg was just a symptom of its own weakness. “When people find out that I’m struggling with Greg, they perceive me differently. And, look, I get it—if you don’t suffer from Greg, it can be hard to understand something that does. But just because I have this one serious problem doesn’t mean I want to be pitied or avoided. I was born with Greg, but I’m more than him. Much, much more.” At press time, a boost in medication dosage was making Greg marginally easier to cope with."
Alcoholic’s Plan For Turning Life Around Doesn’t Involve Getting Sober,2/13/17,969,"SAVANNAH, GA—Realizing something needed to change before it was too late, local alcoholic Darren Weller laid out a plan for turning his life around Monday that had absolutely nothing to do with getting sober. “Today’s the day that I finally clean up my act and start taking the steps I need to better myself,” said the visibly intoxicated Weller to his fellow bar patrons, outlining a series of dramatic steps aimed at improving his physical and mental health that will in no way interfere with his crippling addiction to alcohol. “No more excuses. It’s time I went back to school and finished my degree. No more pizza and beer every night. I’ll probably live five more years just by having salad and beer. Who knows, I might even start getting a run in every night before I hit the bars. Yeah, I really feel like this is a new beginning.” At press time, Weller had passed out on his bar stool, already making good on his plan to get to sleep at a more reasonable hour."
Nation’s Stomach Ulcers Predict Trump Administration Will Provide Opportunities For Unlimited Growth In 2017,2/02/17,908,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to ride a wave of momentum after a historically strong year, the nation’s stomach ulcers predicted Thursday that the Trump administration will provide opportunities for unlimited growth in 2017. “The outlook for the coming year is just fantastic—in fact, we could see an unprecedented expansion of ulcers under President Trump,” said an ulcer representative, adding that the mood around the country was ideal for the prosperity and advancement of the gnawing internal lesions, and that there had already been a record increase in Trump’s first week alone. “For stomach and intestinal ulcers alike, there’s just a new sense of energy and inspiration under Donald Trump. Frankly, we haven’t seen this much confidence since World War II.” Despite its optimism, however, the membrane rupture conceded that the growth of ulcers may within months pale in comparison to that of coronary blockages."
Lab Mouse Nervous For First Day Of New Job Getting Cancer,1/27/17,997,"STANFORD, CA—Anxious about all the brand-new challenges that lay ahead, a laboratory mouse was reportedly feeling nervous Friday in anticipation of its first day at a new job getting cancer. “Honestly, I’ve got butterflies in my stomach wondering how being riddled with tumors is going to go,” said the 6-month-old white rodent, adding that it couldn’t help but have the jitters when it realized it would have to show up and start developing agonizing malignant growths pretty much from day one. “I was good at my old gig ingesting dietary supplements, but this new job metastasizing cancer cells to my bones, organs, and lymph nodes is a rare opportunity for me. I mean, just the thought of walking in there and not getting cancer, of just sitting there with perfectly intact tissue, is keeping me up at night.” At press time, the mouse had reportedly calmed down after reassuring itself that it was sure to get cancer since it had already been genetically modified to have no way of stopping it."
Study Finds Health Benefits Associated With Seriously Considering Going Vegetarian For A While Now,1/24/17,1329,"ROCKVILLE, MD—In what researchers describe as a major discovery in the field of dietetics, a study published in the American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition Tuesday linked long-term health benefits to seriously thinking about going vegetarian for a while now. “Our research found that people who actively toss around the idea of cutting meat out of their diet exhibited substantial and lasting improvements in their physical well-being,” said study lead author Dr. Olivia Marlow, adding that regularly telling others about one’s plan to transition to an exclusively plant-based diet sometime in the near future was strongly associated with dramatic reductions in heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. “The results also demonstrated a robust correlation between improved cardiovascular health and telling acquaintances that while avoiding bacon would be hard, it wasn’t like you were eating a steak every night to begin with. In addition, the positive relationship between browsing vegetarian cookbooks and restaurants online and overall longevity seems especially promising.” The researchers went on to state, however, that the benefits of considering a vegetarian diet still paled in comparison to those enjoyed by individuals who inform friends they were now officially meat-free and haven’t had a burger in more than a week."
"Whale Regrets Eating 290,000 Plastic Poker Chips That Fell Off Container Ship",1/18/17,741,"ATLANTIC OCEAN—Shifting uncomfortably in the water as it struggled with painful indigestion, a local fin whale expressed a growing sense of regret Wednesday after eating 290,000 plastic poker chips that had fallen from a container ship during a recent storm. “Ugh, polishing off all those little things was a huge mistake,” said the bloated whale, lamenting that it didn’t show more restraint and stop feeding after straining the first 100,000 small plastic discs through its baleen. “The red ones just looked so tasty, I couldn’t help myself. God, I scarfed down way too many tons of those things. What the hell was I thinking?” At press time, the contrite whale was vowing to stick to a strict diet of krill and the occasional radial tire."
32-Year-Old Still Not Entirely Sure Where Body Stands With Lactose,1/16/17,878,"LANCASTER, PA—Still unable to draw any solid conclusions from the unpredictable reactions she has experienced over her lifetime, local 32-year-old Michelle Waldman acknowledged Monday that she was even now not entirely sure where her body stands with lactose. “I don’t think I can do milk—definitely not whole milk—but yogurt seems to be fine,” said Waldman, adding that despite her three decades of observing the way her stomach handles cheese, she could only conclusively determine that certain soft cheeses made her feel bloated. “Ice cream is mostly okay, though sometimes it gives me cramps. That may just be because I ate too much, though, and not necessarily because of the lactose. I guess it could be both, right?” Waldman later added that while she had a vague understanding of her response to lactose, she had not even begun to untangle her body’s position on gluten."
Man Bragging About How Infrequently He Receives Dental Care,1/06/17,984,"TACOMA, WA—Treating the amount of time that had passed since his last appointment as a source of great personal pride, local man Kyle Telford, 25, reportedly bragged to several friends Friday about how infrequently he receives dental care. “I haven’t been to the dentist for at least four or five years now,” Telford reportedly said aloud in a confident and gloating tone of voice, proudly touting the fact that he had received no professional teeth cleaning over a period of time during which experts recommend seeing a dentist eight to 10 times. “Honestly, I can’t even remember the last time I went. I probably haven’t gone since freshman year of college, or maybe it was back in high school. My parents are always telling me to make an appointment, but I never do.” Telford reportedly followed his show of bravado about his rare dentist visits with a grandiose boast that he has no intention of seeing a doctor even though he’s been having frequent unexplained headaches recently."
Man Wakes From Nightmare Relieved It Only Expression Of His Real-Life Problems,11/21/16,1228,"NEW ORLEANS—Jolting awake in a panicked daze, local man Bill Rolinger reportedly breathed a sigh of relief early Monday morning after realizing that the nightmare he had just experienced was only a reflection of his real-life problems. “Whew! Thank God that was just a manifestation of the actual deep-seated issues that I refuse to address and that have now seeped deep into my subconscious,” said Rolinger, assuring himself that what had just transpired was nothing more than a slightly more vivid reiteration of the problems that plague him day in and day out. “I was really frightened there before I realized that everything happening was simply my sleeping mind showing itself powerless to unchain itself from my daytime fears and then translating those exact anxieties into the language of dreams. It was intense for sure, but it felt good to wake up and register the fact that it was nothing more than a passing interpretation of everything that’s chronically wrong with my life.” Rolinger reportedly then proceeded to go back to sleep, comforted in the knowledge that even if he had another nightmare, it would just be a version of the troubles that would hamper him at work tomorrow and likely for the rest of his life."
Stealing Tampons From Office Bathroom Currently Woman’s Only Source Of Joy,11/18/16,1158,"SEATTLE—Saying the small act of defiance helped to brighten her otherwise dejected mood these days, local woman Becca Curran told reporters Friday that stealing tampons from her office’s bathroom was currently her only source of joy. “Given the way everything’s been going lately, grabbing a handful of tampons and stuffing them into my bag has become the one thing I can really count on to lift my spirits,” said the 28-year-old billing specialist, who added that while the current sociopolitical climate makes it nearly impossible to feel optimistic about anything, purloining the feminine hygiene products every time she enters the office restroom remains a genuine pleasure and is reliably the highlight of her workday. “When I see that fully stocked basket sitting there on the countertop just ripe for the picking, it actually makes my day a bit better. I like knowing that I won’t have to pay for my own tampons and that I’m also taking advantage of my company’s resources. It’s really all I’ve got left to feel good about right now.” Curran added that she had no idea how the millions of women whose workplaces don’t provide free tampons were coping."
Surgeon General Recommends Exercising Once Every Several Months During Flash Of Panic About Health,11/18/16,1639,"WASHINGTON—Highlighting the benefits of brief, infrequent aerobic activity, U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy urged Americans Friday to make sure to exercise once every few months during a frenzied moment of panic regarding their health. “It’s important that citizens of all ages, genders, and backgrounds make the time every four to nine months to go for a quick jog or do 15 halfhearted push-ups in the midst of a frantic surge of concern about their physical fitness,” said Murthy, who explained that individuals need not possess a gym membership or their own exercise equipment to engage in twice-yearly anxiety-fueled attempts at working out, and could instead simply perform five to 20 minutes of various calisthenics in their own home during a short-lived fit of worry spurred by an increase in their weight or a feeling of general decline in their well-being. “Whether you see a troubling news report on the risks of heart disease or suddenly take note of the condition that one of your parents is in and figure that you’re on track to end up like them one day, the key is to just get out there and exert yourself on a bike, or a treadmill, or with a set of weights in those fleeting few minutes that you feel alarmed enough to try to stave off a potential health crisis. And for optimal results, we strongly recommend getting into a regular routine of repeating this process every half year or so.” The surgeon general also recommended that all Americans spend three and a half days on whatever the current fad diet is any time they find themselves feeling particularly guilty about the amount of fast food they’ve been consuming."
Man Had No Idea Cough Was Going To Be Wet One,10/19/16,761,"MUSKEGON, MI—Caught completely off guard by the viscous lump of sputum that was dislodged and sent rocketing upward from his lower respiratory tract, area man Luke Reese confirmed Wednesday he had no idea his impending cough was going to be a wet one. “Jesus, where the hell did that come from?” said the startled 33-year-old, stating that he had been under the impression he was simply clearing his throat and was by no means expecting to eject such a behemoth. “If I’d known what I was in for I would’ve gotten a tissue ready, but this thing totally came out of left field. Ugh, God, it’s in my mouth now.” Reese went on to say that although his next cough appeared as if it would be benign, after what had just transpired he was bracing himself for anything."
Body Given False Hope With First Piece Of Fruit In 9 Days,10/14/16,871,"DULUTH, MN—Excitedly believing the chunk of strawberry marked the beginning of a new, more nutritious diet, the body of area woman Jenny Cook was reportedly given a sense of false hope Friday after the 27-year-old consumed a piece of fruit for the first time in nine days. “Hey, look—fruit! Maybe she’s starting to turn things around,” the woman’s internal organs were reported to have thought in response to the appearance of the strawberry, allowing themselves to naively fantasize about a series of balanced, wholesome, and properly portioned meals in an act of desperate, wishful thinking. “If we get a few more of these each day, we might just be all right. You’ve got to think we’ll probably start getting some vegetables down here pretty soon too!” Sources confirmed that, moments later, Cook’s dispirited esophagus reported an incoming stream of chocolate fondue."
Man Wakes From Coma With Ability To Understand Health Insurance Policy,10/05/16,4281,"PARKER, CO—In what doctors are calling a true medical miracle, local construction worker Kal Mathyssen awoke from a week-long coma early Wednesday with the ability to fully comprehend his health insurance plan, sources at Parker Adventist Hospital confirmed. Mathyssen, who sustained a severe head injury after a fall at a nearby job site, reportedly stunned hospital staff and family members when he suddenly regained consciousness around 1 a.m. and began confidently filling out all the paperwork required by managed care company Aetna to receive the benefits guaranteed by his insurance policy. “I was online struggling to figure out what is and isn’t covered by our plan, and then Kal just woke up and somehow knew exactly what needed to be done,” said Mathyssen’s wife, Carol, explaining that prior to his coma, her husband had possessed only an average person’s understanding of the process required to file for reimbursement of medical expenses. “Kal was on the phone using words I’d never heard come out of his mouth before—stuff about billing codes, out-of-pocket maximums, and I don’t know what else.” “As soon as he picked up the claim form and knew exactly what to fill in on the line marked ‘employee group number,’ I knew something was very different,” she continued. “It was just so clear that something had changed inside him.” According to doctors, within minutes of waking up in the intensive care unit, the 38-year-old began to display an unusually strong grasp of his Aetna Preferred health plan. Astonished onlookers confirmed that after consulting his insurer’s website and listening to a series of recorded messages on a customer service line, Mathyssen determined he would be responsible for a $250 emergency room copay, the amount remaining on his policy’s aggregate family deductible, and the full sticker price of any non-formulary medications he may require during his recovery. In addition, several of Mathyssen’s family members said they had a difficult time believing that the man who emerged from the coma was the same person they had always known, pointing out that their relative, who has seldom made use of his Health Savings Account in the past, showed a rare ability to determine which bills he would be able to pay for with his HSA debit card and which nonqualified expenses he would have to pay for with his savings or, should that become depleted, through a monthly installment plan. “In 21 years of practicing emergency medicine, I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Dr. Peggy Adams, who visited Mathyssen during her morning rounds, when the patient reportedly asked about receiving a flu shot and other preventative care procedures his plan covers in full. “It’s impressive that he’s so calm and lucid at this stage, but it’s truly astounding that he knew to ask proactively if the hospital was covered as an in-network facility with his HMO.” “He even double-checked with the radiologist to make sure his CT scan would be billed correctly in case the insurance company later disputed the claim,” she added. “He certainly came out of that coma with a unique gift.” Bedside sources said they were left shocked and speechless when Mathyssen later picked up his cell phone and not only reached the person he needed to speak with in Aetna’s benefits department, but also had a cordial conversation in which he appeared to follow everything the representative was saying, ending the call in less than five minutes with a reference number documenting the exchange. “I’ve tried to come up with an explanation for what caused this, but I’m at a loss, other than to say it’s one of the mysteries of human cognition,” said Adams, calling Mathyssen’s case “one in a million.” “I suppose one minute you can be on a ventilator fighting for your life, and the next you can be entirely aware that your emergency room visit is covered at a different rate than your EMS transfer, and that the latter is billed directly by the ambulance company that 911 dispatched to pick you up. It’s truly remarkable.” The physician went on to state that she expects Mathyssen to make a full recovery, and that he might one day even gain the ability to understand the paperwork he will need to fill out to file for bankruptcy once he is billed for his hospital stay."
Obesity: Myth Vs. Fact,9/23/16,954,"With as many as one in three people in the U.S. qualifying as obese, misconceptions are often formed about what it means to be significantly overweight.

Report: Feeling Bad Right Now Most Reliable Predictor Of Feeling Bad Forever,9/20/16,3280,"STANFORD, CA—Saying their findings were consistent across all ages and demographic groups, psychologists at Stanford University released a groundbreaking report this week confirming that feeling bad right now is an extremely accurate predictor of feeling bad forever. The report, which draws its conclusions from a longitudinal study of 500 participants conducted over the course of 30 years, found a nearly perfect correlation between experiencing sadness, anger, loneliness, and despair at the current moment and then continuing to experience those exact same emotions for the rest of one’s life no matter what. “Based on our findings, we can state with a high level of certainty that anyone who feels miserable at the present time will, from this moment onward, always feel miserable,” said the report’s co-author Danielle Bowman, adding that researchers observed zero cases in which a subject’s feelings of sorrow or hopelessness ever went away in the short or long term. “For example, if, at the moment, you are desperately lonely and depressed, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests you will still feel that way when you wake up tomorrow, the day after that, a month from now, in five years, and indeed, every single waking second until you die.” “There were, however, several instances in which people’s emotional states did eventually change,” Bowman continued. “In roughly 31 percent of cases, people began to feel much worse over the years.” According to the study, individuals who currently struggle with feelings of worthlessness and believe there is no way anyone could ever really love them have a 99.8 percent chance of maintaining that state of mind for the remainder of their natural lives. Similarly, the results indicated a state of anguish will be permanent for 99.6 percent of those suffering from a sense that their life is headed in the wrong direction and there is nothing they can do to stop it. The study, which began with clinical trials and field observations in 1986, also concluded that anyone who at any point became anxious or melancholy never again experienced happiness in any form, regardless of any changes in their exercise habits, diet, psychological or pharmacological treatments, relationship status, or employment situation. In addition, the report’s authors recommended that if you feel bad at present, you should simply save yourself further trouble by abandoning any hope of things ever getting better. Greg Hudson, a participant in the study who said he hasn’t felt a pleasant or even neutral emotion since the 1990s, told reporters he agreed with the researchers’ recommendation. “About 20 years ago, I was going through a hard time both at work and at home, putting in too many hours and having difficulty getting along with my boss while at the same time dealing with some marital stress,” said Hudson, a visibly weary man now in his 50s. “Just waking up and getting out of bed every day was like torture. That was in 1997, and I can honestly say that today, after all these years, I feel every bit as awful as I did back then. At no point has anything changed. Ever.” The study also found strong evidence to suggest that feelings of pure joy can be expected to dissipate completely within one to two seconds after they first appear."

Clinton Debunks Rumors About Health By Telling Audience Exact Day She Will Die,8/29/16,1023,"PENSACOLA, FL—Addressing recent allegations that she is physically unfit to serve in the Oval Office, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, 68, debunked rumors about her health Monday by telling the audience at a campaign rally the exact day she will die. “To those who say I’m not able-bodied enough to be president, let me respond: I will die on January 23, 2041,” said Clinton, who then further discredited those questioning her strength and wellness by confirming she will pass away early that morning, and that the cause of death will be congestive heart failure related to her advanced age. “I will die surrounded by my loved ones, who will then mourn me for an appropriate length of time.

New Study Recommends Insects Spend At Least 30 Minutes Skittering Per Day,8/23/16,1283,"ATHENS, GA—Enumerating the variety of health benefits that result from the practice, a study released Tuesday by the Department of Entomology at the University of Georgia recommends all insects spend at least 30 minutes skittering per day. “We followed a small sample population of 2.3 million insects and found that skittering for just half an hour a day significantly strengthened the thorax and boosted circulation to the legs, wings, and antennae,” said researcher Calista Leon, who added that if 30 minutes was too much exertion for out-of-shape or infirm bugs, even simply scuttling from along the baseboard to under the oven whenever the lights come on had been proven to increase lifespan by as much as two or three weeks. “It is especially recommended for older insects, as skittering on a regular basis can help improve foregut, midgut, and hindgut function and lowers the risk of developing degenerative compound eye disease. Also, we strongly recommend stretching all six legs before starting and urge insects not to overexert themselves by darting straight up a wall if they haven’t done it in a while.” Leon reminded insects that the best long-term health results could be achieved by combining 30 minutes of skittering each day with a high-protein diet of skin flakes."

Scientists Confirm First Case Of Zika Transmission From Article To Reader,8/08/16,1199,"ATLANTA—In an unprecedented warning to the U.S. populace, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that scientists had discovered the first known case of an individual contracting the Zika virus directly from a news article on the infectious disease. “Until now, we had believed Zika was only spread through mosquito bites and sexual contact, but we have determined that the infection can also be transmitted via exposure to media coverage of the epidemic,” said CDC spokesman Jason Crank, referring to a woman in Waverly, NE who reportedly tested positive for the virus after following an internet link to a news story on the latest Zika outbreak in the continental United States. “To prevent further spread of the disease, we recommend individuals avoid reading any part of any article on the subject, as the CDC believes Zika can be transmitted by a single paragraph, or, in some cases, just a headline. In addition, we advise anyone exposed to a full two-minute broadcast news segment on the virus to immediately turn off their television and quarantine themselves until further notice.” At press time, sources confirmed that you were beginning to experience a high fever."
Experts Advise Against Throwing Laptop Across Office Even Though It Will Feel Incredible,8/05/16,1913,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the negative consequences in the long term outweigh any short-term satisfaction, experts from the American Psychological Association issued a statement Friday advising individuals against picking up their laptop and throwing it as hard as they can across the office, even though doing so would feel absolutely incredible. “While going through with such an act is certain to provide subjects with feelings of elation, giddiness, and a sense of freedom, we recommend that the nation’s office workers do not stand up in a moment of fury, rip their laptop off their desk, chuck it across their workspace, and watch it smash into a wall,” read the advisory in part, noting that the positive emotional state resulting from using all one’s energy to hurl their computer over several rows of nearby cubicles is only temporary, while the repercussions are likely to be largely detrimental and long-lasting, ranging from the high likelihood of rendering one’s machine unusable, to the possibility of making coworkers feel unsafe, to the near certainty of being disciplined or terminated by one’s employer. “Although it would provide an exhilarating adrenaline rush like you’ve never felt before, whipping your laptop out the nearest window like a Frisbee or taking it in both hands and sending it tumbling wildly down a stairwell is not, ultimately, in the best interests of your personal or professional life. We also advise against repeatedly slamming your computer onto the surface of your desk while letting out an intense scream of rage, or even just angrily folding your laptop’s monitor all the way back until it snaps off in your hands, despite the sensation of pure ecstasy either action would immediately induce.” The report went on to encourage the nation’s workers to instead take a walk around the block to relieve their stress, even though it would feel like a huge fucking letdown."
Report: Ground Still Least Desirable Surface For Breaking Fall,8/02/16,1150,"WASHINGTON—Citing its innate hardness and increased likelihood of causing pain, the Department of Health and Human Services published a report Tuesday revealing that the ground remains the least desirable surface for breaking a fall. “Our research determined that whether an individual stumbles while walking or plummets from a great height, the firmness of the ground and its inability to absorb impacts places it at the very bottom of the list of favored surfaces on which to land,” said the report’s lead author, Miles Potter, who confirmed that numerous other surfaces, such as water, mattresses, and fabric awnings, were found to be preferable to the ground for their ability to soften a landing and minimize bruises, lacerations, and broken bones. “The solid, unyielding nature of the ground leads us to recommend that anyone currently plunging downward in an out-of-control fashion instead choose an open dumpster full of garbage bags, a haystack, or even other people to cushion their fall.” The report also stated that anyone who must come into forcible contact with the ground should opt for soil over harder options like concrete and rock."
‘DSM-5’ Updated To Accommodate Man Who Is Legitimately Being Ordered To Kill By The Moon,8/01/16,1626,"ARLINGTON, VA—Saying they were committed to ensuring the influential reference text accurately represented all known psychological conditions, leading members of the American Psychiatric Association announced Monday they would update the Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition to accommodate a man who is legitimately being ordered by the moon to kill those around him. “After conducting extensive psychological examinations of the individual in question, our board has determined that the patient shows no sign of delusion or hallucination and is in fact receiving regular instruction from Earth’s moon to commit murder, and our classification manual must be revised to reflect these findings,” said APA medical director Saul M. Levin, clarifying that the man’s affliction would not be subcategorized as a schizophrenic or psychotic disorder, as the voice he hears urging him to bludgeon others to death in fits of manic violence emanates from the moon itself and not from within his own mind. “Based on our study of this patient, we will add the new entry ‘Lunar-Motivated Homicidal Impulse Syndrome’ to the DSM, which is characterized by regular communication with the moon, persistent homicidal urges, and violent behavior stemming from one’s efforts to appease the moon.” Levin added that because the man’s mental state did not derive from any abnormal neurochemistry, standard psychiatric medications would likely have little effect on his condition, and thus his only course of treatment would be to cut out the small device that was implanted in his brain for receiving the transmissions."
"Black Mark On Birth Control Manufacturer’s Record Weighs In At 7 Pounds, 6 Ounces",6/27/16,1045,"LONG BEACH, CA—At approximately 7:05 a.m. Monday, sources at St. Mary Medical Center confirmed that local woman Deliah Zahn gave birth to a healthy black mark on the record of Bayer—manufacturer of the birth control pill Yaz—weighing in at 7 pounds, 6 ounces. “I’m pleased to report the labor and delivery went smoothly, and that both mother and [notable blemish on the efficacy of the widely trusted oral contraceptive] are getting some much-needed rest,” said Dr. Patricia Nguyen, who noted that, aside from some mild jaundice, the glaring evidence of the drug’s failure was completely healthy. “I don’t think we’ll need to keep them here for more than another 24 hours. I’m sure the new parents are excited to get back home and start spending time with their [instance falling within the less than 1 percent of cases in which the pill’s active ingredients are unable to prevent pregnancy].” At press time, sources confirmed that Zahn and her husband had decided to name the exceedingly rare—but still statistically possible—accident “Sophia.”"
New Mountain Dew Vows To Kill 99.9% Of Stomach Bacteria,6/16/16,1074,"PURCHASE, NY—Touting the beverage’s refreshing citrus taste, tongue-tingling carbonation, and prescription-strength antimicrobial properties, PepsiCo officials announced Wednesday that their newest product, Mountain Dew Code White, kills 99.9 percent of consumers’ stomach bacteria. “If you like Mountain Dew, you’re going to love Code White. All it takes is one sip and you’ll start feeling the rush of your gut flora being systematically exterminated,” said Mountain Dew product manager Mark Aldag, boasting that extensive lab tests had proved the drink’s lethality to nearly all of the stomach’s bacterial phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. “Whether you need a little extra boost in the middle of the workday or to eradicate an unwanted strain of H. pylori embedded in the mucus lining of your stomach, just grab a Code White and you’re sure to be satisfied!” PepsiCo officials went on to urge consumers to exercise caution, as any bacteria that survived the new beverage could be highly resistant to all forms of antibiotics."
CDC Horrified After Discovering Existence Of Thousands Of Public Pools,6/15/16,3589,"WASHINGTON—Calling the finding an imminent threat to public health nationwide, horrified officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened an emergency press conference Wednesday to announce they had discovered the existence of thousands of public pools throughout the country. Visibly alarmed CDC personnel explained that they received a disturbing report last week of a municipal park in Astoria, NY that contained what they described as “an in-ground reservoir filled with approximately 40,000 gallons of tepid water mixed with human sweat, body hair, bacteria, and mucus.” The officials stated that further investigation revealed dozens of similar cases in the surrounding area, touching off fears of a widespread epidemic. “We initially believed the pool in Astoria was an anomaly, but as we widened our search, we found this troubling phenomenon in nearly every population center we looked—the situation is far worse than anything we could have ever imagined,” said CDC director Thomas Frieden, who added that confirmed accounts of the large repositories of filth-suffused liquid have since been documented in all 50 states. “Our preliminary estimates indicate that millions of Americans may have already come into contact with these communal bathing sites. And perhaps most frighteningly, our models suggest that we may have discovered them too late to contain further spread.” “We urge citizens to take common-sense precautions by avoiding these public pools, as well as any dripping wet or towel-clad individuals who may have recently been exposed to one,” he continued. “While it’s important that citizens not panic, we want to make it clear to the public just how disgusting these things are.” Researchers confirmed that the pools, which they said are most easily identified by their grimy concrete surfaces and prominent ring of damp plastic chairs surrounding them, are typically found in local and state parks, but noted that some private clubs have also been known to harbor the lukewarm, blue-colored basins teeming with assorted detritus. Officials also warned that while the risk of exposure appears greatest in the warmer months, the prevalence of public pools inside schools and hotels means that Americans are in danger of contact throughout the year. Frieden reported that the CDC is currently formulating a plan to eradicate the pools by draining them as quickly as possible. In the interim, he cautioned that Americans—especially young children and those with weakened immune systems—should maintain a minimum distance of 150 feet from any public pool they may encounter, adding that even minimal exposure of five minutes or less was likely to pose serious risks, ranging from the possibility of encountering pockets of urine to the high likelihood of wading into clusters of dead bugs and other unidentified floating matter that clump together in pools’ corners. Those who believe they may have come into contact with a public pool were advised by officials to immediately call a hotline listed on the CDC’s website. “The reality is that anyone, anywhere, could end up in a public pool,” said Frieden, who noted that the organization was developing a special task force to address the related scourges of communal hot tubs and water parks it had also recently uncovered. “The last thing we want is for Americans to take this situation lightly. These pools are nasty, smelly and almost certainly contain trace amounts of fecal matter.” “Frankly, it’s hard to believe something as awful as this could still exist in the 21st century, ” he added."

Man Googling ‘Tender Lump On Neck’ About To Begin Exciting New Phase In Life,5/23/16,1284,"NATICK, MA—Entirely unbeknownst to him, 45-year-old local resident Timothy Lang stood on the threshold of an exciting new phase in his life Monday as he typed the phrase “tender lump on neck” into Google’s search bar, sources reported. The simple act of entering the particular set of search terms into his internet browser and pressing the return key on his laptop is said to have suddenly opened a fresh new chapter in the man’s life, one that will soon introduce him to dozens of strangers and scores of novel, indelible experiences, while also fundamentally changing his relationships with friends and family, and leading him to make major alterations to his lifestyle. Further reports indicate that the split second between when he finished typing and the moment his search results appeared onscreen would be the last time Lang recognizes himself as the person he is now, as core aspects of the local bank manager’s very identity will, according to sources, begin to undergo immediate and significant transformations. At press time, Lang was reportedly searching the phrase “tender lump vs. tumor,” an action ironically intended to stem the onrushing deluge of profound life changes, but which will only serve to greatly accelerate his entry into the next phase of his existence."
Heart Attack A Real Wake-Up Call For Man’s Insurance Provider,5/19/16,1246,"HARTFORD, CT—Saying the incident had forced them to completely rethink their past decisions about the man’s coverage and how they would approach his policy from here on out, Aetna executives reported Thursday that the recent heart attack of longtime plan member Michael Burns was a real wake-up call for the 163-year-old insurance company. “This came as a terrible shock, but to be honest, it was probably just what we needed to shake us out of our old habits and realize we have to make some big changes around here,” said CEO Mark Bertolini, adding that the health care provider had known for years that Burns’ monthly premium could be easily two or three times its current level, and that it was unfortunate that it had taken a major emergency and hospitalization for the company to finally do something about it. “You want to believe you can keep charging someone the same co-pays forever, but after this, we’re really going to have to keep a closer watch to make sure his yearly deductible keeps pace with his increased health risk—that’s just common sense. I honestly didn’t realize things had gotten this bad.” Bertolini added that he was just glad they had caught the problem while Burns still had plenty of profitably healthy years left."
Woman Had No Idea Participating In 5K Walk Could Be So Unrewarding,5/16/16,1127,"KENOSHA, WI—After participating in the fundraising event for a local charity this past weekend, area woman Ashley Hyland reported to friends and family Monday that she had no idea competing in a 5K walk could be so unrewarding. “This was my first time doing a race like this, so I was completely unprepared for what an insignificant life experience it turned out to be,” said Hyland, adding that she was blindsided by the underwhelming emotions and utter lack of accomplishment she felt as she crossed the finish line of the 5,000-meter race. “It didn’t really hit me until I was out there doing it when I thought to myself, ‘Wow, this is not in any way giving me a sense of purpose or changing my perspective on life.’ I was really taken aback by how little it all meant. And the thing is, it wasn’t just unrewarding for me—it was unrewarding for so many other people given that I raised just a total of $35 for diabetes research.” Hyland added that the experience of completing a few slow laps around the public park with 2,000 or 3,000 other participants was something she would neglect to remember for the rest of her life."
"Report: 750,000 Americans Die Each Year During First Attempt To Get Back In Shape",5/02/16,1147,"WASHINGTON—According to an alarming report published Monday in the Journal Of Applied Physiology, three quarters of a million Americans die annually during their first attempt to get back in shape. “We found that, each year, about 225,000 out-of-shape Americans collapse and perish within the first three minutes of attempting to start jogging again, with most typically not making it to the end of their own block,” said study co-author Kathy Lyons, adding that a further 60,000 Americans who decide to improve their health by swimming laps succumb to overexertion every year and sink to the bottom of the pool and drown after just a few strokes. “Perhaps most troubling, our data show that 60 percent of Americans who commit to regaining their former level of physical fitness by hiring a personal trainer at a gym drop dead almost instantly during their first abdominal crunch. And another 30 percent die while stretching before they even begin their workout.” The study further noted that, of the Americans who managed to survive their first attempt at exercise in years, nine in 10 suffered from debilitating pain for the rest of their lives."
Guy At Gym Has Precious Little Diary To Keep Track Of All His Exercises,4/21/16,985,"NEW BERLIN, WI—Making sure to date the page before recording all the juiciest and most private details from his daily exercise routine, local gym-goer Phillip Keller reportedly took out his precious little diary Thursday in order to keep track of his workout. “I like to jot down everything I do so I can track my progress,” said the 27-year-old, who reportedly carries his adorable leather-bound journal with him wherever he goes inside Belmont Fitness Center, using the blank page as a sanctuary in which to freely pour his heart out over the number of sets and reps he performs during each exercise. “It’s a great way to stay motivated, and it also helps me vary up my training so I’m not just doing the same stuff every week.” After finishing his workout and showering, Keller reportedly sat in the locker room and excitedly ventured into his diary once more, taking a quiet moment to express his innermost hopes and dreams about reaching new fitness goals by the end of the month."
Man Ashamed Of Himself After Cashier Reads Food Order Back To Him,4/20/16,767,"ORANGE, CA—Checking over his shoulder to make sure no one else was within earshot, area man Derek Jordan reportedly felt deeply ashamed of himself Wednesday after a cashier at a local fast-food restaurant read his order back to him. “Yeah, yeah, okay—you got it,” said a mortified Jordan, cringing and staring downward at the counter as the cashier continued to list off each of his items one by one, several of which she made a point to note he had ordered with extra cheese. “Yup, uh-huh, that’s everything. Jesus.” Sources reported that Jordan was then too humiliated to look the cashier in the eye when she handed him his order several moments later, immediately retreating to the most isolated booth in the restaurant, furthest from any other patrons or windows."

Mom Apologizing For Going Through Menopause,4/05/16,981,"LUTSEN, MN—According to witnesses, local mother Deborah Miller, 49, apologized to her family profusely Monday for going through the natural biological process of menopause. “Gosh, I am so sorry—I know it’s cold in here, but I’m having a hot flash,” said Miller as she cracked open a window in the den, fanned herself with a nearby magazine while her husband and two sons watched television, and repeatedly asked them for forgiveness for her ovaries ceasing to release eggs and her decreased estrogen production, physical and chemical changes that happen to every woman during her lifetime and over which Miller has no control. “I really hope I’m not bothering anyone. This won’t last long, I promise. Sorry, sorry.” Sources added that Miller later apologized softly to no one in particular for the perfectly normal stage of life when she stepped on several loud floorboards late at night during a bout of hormone-related insomnia while everyone else in her family was sound asleep."
Sudafed Introduces New Sinus Drill For Immediate Congestion Relief,3/24/16,980,"NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—Touting the over-the-counter product’s ability to effectively treat cold symptoms, pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson & Johnson introduced Friday its new Sudafed 18-volt cordless Sinus Drill capable of providing immediate congestion relief. “The Sinus Drill alleviates pain and discomfort by boring a small hole into the forehead or bridge of one’s nose to release pressure,” said Sudafed product manager Kelly Arrington, adding that the Sinus Drill, which comes with a set of four 1/8-inch to 1/2-inch carbide tip bits to accommodate a variety of bone densities, also clears inflamed nasal passageways by loosening mucus. “For adults, we suggest drilling two holes every four to six hours. For children, just one hole is recommended, although for best results you can try coating the bit in honey to help lubricate its entry into the skull.” For symptoms that continue to persist after one week, Arrington recommended Sudafed’s Extra-Strength Sinus Jackhammer."
Video Game Boss Thinking He Should Get Big Glowing Weak Spot On Back Checked Out,3/23/16,997,"STAGE 6—Saying the slightly raised, throbbing red patch of skin has been bothering him for quite some time, local video game boss Overlord told reporters Wednesday he was thinking he should get the big glowing weak spot on his back checked out. “I was hoping the spot would eventually just go away, but recently it started flashing white when anything touches it,” said Overlord, adding that whenever the radiant area is aggravated, he becomes paralyzed for several seconds, during which time he cannot retract his segmented limbs or move the projectile-spitting skull-faces at the end of his appendages. “I thought trying to move up and down in a fixed cycle would help, but it turns out that just makes it worse. If it doesn’t go away in a couple days, I’m definitely going to the doctor. I’m getting worried about how often I vomit armor-plated slugs.” Overlord added that his habit of staying inside a dark, musty cave made of bones all day probably wasn’t doing his health any favors, either."
Report: Leading Cause Of Death Still Venturing Beyond The Pines,3/23/16,4072,"BETHESDA, MD—Confirming accounts handed down among townsfolk for generations untold, a report released Wednesday by the National Institutes of Health has revealed the top cause of death in the United States is still venturing beyond the pines. The report, which analyzed the nation’s mortality data from the past decade, found that wandering past the tree line and entering the shadowy depths that lie therein results in approximately 650,000 deaths each year. Researchers noted that the risk of meeting a mysterious and deadly fate beyond the pines remained high across all demographics, from the purest-hearted children to the most revered town elders. “Our findings indicate that forces unknown lurking among the black pines account for one in every four American deaths,” said report co-author Shannon Reid, noting that the survival rate for individuals who set foot upon the forest floor and allow the darkness below the boughs to envelop them has held steady at just 2 percent. “Merely straying close to the pines is dangerous, but once you pass beneath the thick, misty canopy through which no beacon of light can penetrate, your risk of death increases dramatically.” She added, “Such fatalities continue to occur regularly, in part because we have seen no decrease in the number of people hearing otherworldly voices that beckon them into the woods with whispers of ‘This way; follow me.’” According to the report, 43 percent of pines-related fatalities are the result of people losing their way on a foggy night, 39 percent can be traced to individuals attempting to find a shortcut despite warnings from all those they pass, and 18 percent occur when people suddenly awaken in the dead of night, walk straight out the door in their bedclothes, and pace blindly through the moonlight in the direction of the trees. Researchers warned that since 2010, there has been a startling increase in beyond-the-pines deaths of children under the age of 6, particularly among those who have gone out looking for flowers to make a daisy chain. Most fatalities reportedly occur just before dawn, at which time the deceased’s clothing is often discovered neatly laid out at the edge of the woods, or a small wooden doll depicting their likeness suddenly appears in their bed. The NIH study confirmed that a very small fraction of those who wander into the pines return alive, but experts said these individuals typically remain mute for the rest of their lives, and are forever marked by spells of wide-eyed paralysis and a shock of prematurely white hair. “There does appear to be a hereditary risk—people with close relatives who have gone where the tall pines grow are more likely to disappear into the trees themselves,” Reid said. “So it is important to know your family history and disregard any dreams you have in which a departed loved one calls out for you to join them in the forest. Doing so is not safe under any circumstance.” Reid told reporters the NIH has undertaken several new initiatives in an attempt to curb the number of deaths in the pines, such as stationing old, cloaked figures at forks in the road to warn travelers about the strange malevolence that dwells in the heart of the woods, and launching an educational campaign to dispel the common misconception that treading into the forbidden grove was perfectly safe under a harvest moon when the light is near bright as day. She also recommended that Americans clip a lock of hair from a young child, tie it with a silk ribbon, and leave it several paces from the edge of the forest to help ward off the deathly menace. “It’s the kind of thing you never think can happen to your family until one day it does,” said Brenna Ayers, whose daughter chased her paper kite into the pines last year and never returned. “I miss Maddy every day, and the haunting sound of her voice softly reciting nursery rhymes that I hear whenever the wind blows through the trees is no replacement.” Reid added that those looking for more information could visit www.NIH.gov or ask the old woman who lives among the hills."

Report: Getting Out Of Bed In Morning Sharply Increases Risk Of Things Getting Even Worse,2/25/16,1190,"WASHINGTON—According to a report published Thursday in the Journal Of Applied Psychology, the act of getting out of bed in the morning dramatically increases the risk of things becoming even worse. “No matter how bad things were upon waking up, the very moment our trial subjects pulled off the covers and stepped out of bed, things spiraled even further downward for them in roughly 92 percent of all cases,” said lead researcher Alison Chaudhary, who added that her research team observed no instances in which rising from one’s bed and beginning to go about one’s day improved things for any of the test participants. “In addition, we discovered that the chances of everything going completely and irreversibly downhill rose even higher should one subsequently get dressed and head toward the front door. After that point, once one has left their home, the likelihood of avoiding being weighed down by steadily mounting misery, pain, and humiliation was quite close to zero.” Chaudhary noted that the only guaranteed way to ensure everything doesn’t fall apart right in front of your eyes is to stay in bed, pull a blanket up over your head, and remain there indefinitely without moving."

She would certainly appreciate it.” The report went on to state that you know how much Mom would do for you if you were in her position."
Jogger Clearly On First Run Of Plan To Turn Life Around,2/09/16,1219,"CHICAGO—Taking note of the man’s beat-up tennis shoes, sweat-drenched shirt, and ill-fitting pair of sweatpants as he made his way down the sidewalk, witnesses reported Tuesday that area jogger Dan Andreychuk was clearly out on his very first run of a plan to turn his life around. “He just started jogging, like, a block or two back, but he already looks really winded—this guy obviously just decided to get his life back on track within the past couple days,” said onlooker Paul Gerstein, surmising that the man had likely been inspired to choose a running distance far beyond his capabilities after recently taking stock of his limited career and relationship prospects, looking at himself in the mirror in disappointment, or watching a TED talk on how to become one’s best self. “Just look at how slow he’s going. This is almost certainly just a part of a whole self-improvement routine he’s putting together with push-ups and sit-ups and maybe some little dumbbell exercises, too.” Witnesses reported seeing a red-faced Andreychuk gasping for air with his hands on his knees several minutes later, clearly entertaining the very first doubts about his resolve that will soon derail his grand plan to remake himself."

Middle-Aged Man In Gym Locker Room Puts Shirt On Before Underwear,2/04/16,810,"FREDERICKSBURG, VA—Unable to fully avert their gaze as the situation unfolded, sources in the men’s locker room at Capital Fitness confirmed Thursday that a middle-aged gym patron put on his shirt before his underwear. “I swear the guy’s pair of briefs were sitting right there on the bench, but he just ignored them and went straight for his shirt,” said onlooker Mike Housakos, who noted that instead of continuing to dress himself after buttoning his shirt down to his waist, the man then walked all the way to the opposite side of the locker room to deposit his towel in the bin. “And it’s not like he was in any rush to get his underwear on after that. He even picked up his phone and looked at it for a little bit. Jesus.” Sources confirmed that at press time, the half-nude man was putting on his socks."
Aerosol Can Surprisingly Upfront About Giving You Cancer,2/03/16,818,"NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—Taken aback by the packaging’s unexpected honesty and directness, sources expressed surprise Wednesday upon noticing that a can of brand-name aerosol disinfectant was so forthright about giving you cancer. “Look, it says ‘CONTAINS KNOWN CARCINOGENS’ almost as big as the Lysol logo—damn, they really went for it,” said 29-year-old resident Maureen Benthos as she inspected the can while shopping at a local Target, pointing out that the container had the word ‘carcinogenic’ in three other places, all in bold, red lettering. “They didn’t even try to obscure it with scientific language or fine print. It basically just says ‘cancer’ all over this thing. Wow.” Several consumers expressed frustration at the labeling, however, noting that it was nowhere near as candid about how high it will get you."
"Zika Virus Joins Lack Of Paid Leave, Unaffordable Child Care As Reasons Woman Afraid Of Getting Pregnant",2/03/16,1333,"GALVESTON, TX—Amid a spate of public health warnings this week regarding the infectious disease’s devastating effects on fetal development, the Zika virus reportedly joined a lack of paid maternity leave and unaffordable child care as reasons why local woman Shannon Kemp is afraid of becoming pregnant. “I was going to hold off getting pregnant for a few years anyway out of fear that my company might let me go when they find out, but this whole Zika scare certainly doesn’t help things either,” said the 26-year-old, explaining that the threat of giving birth to a child with an underdeveloped brain was just one of a litany of reasons behind her dread of becoming pregnant, including the likelihood of being passed over for promotions, the lower salaries received by mothers, the rising cost of prenatal care, the rising cost of postnatal care, the increased difficulty in being hired should she want or need to switch jobs, and the social stigma associated with breastfeeding in public. “Honestly, this really isn’t even the thing that worries me most about getting pregnant. It’s definitely good to be aware of, but even if they find a cure for Zika tomorrow, it’s not like I can afford to get pregnant under my current insurance plan.” Kemp added that it’s a good thing she still has limited access to expensive contraception."

Christ, I really did a number on it last night [and every previous day for almost 60 years]. Oww.” Sources later confirmed that Braley was going to try to alleviate his back pain by lying down on his couch and keeping stationary for the rest of the evening as well as most of the remaining 16 years of his life."
Study: 90% Of Workplace Injuries Caused By Bare-Knuckle Boxing,1/27/16,1367,"CHAMPAIGN, IL—Researchers from the University of Illinois released a new study of occupational hazards Wednesday revealing that 90 percent of workplace injuries in the United States are caused by bare-knuckle boxing. “According to our data, roughly nine of every 10 injuries that occur on the job stem from incidents in which two employees stand up from their desks, roll up their sleeves, clench their raised hands in fists, and then circle each other before unleashing a barrage of gloveless blows,” said lead researcher Carol Skelton, adding that, while fisticuffs-related bruises, cuts, and bone fractures most often occur in large, open areas like lobbies and conference rooms, it was not uncommon for impromptu slugfests to break out in kitchenettes, server rooms, or between rows of cubicles. “Additionally, we found that the most severe instances of bodily harm in offices typically transpire when one worker has another pinned up against a whiteboard or printing station and is pummeling them with a brutal combination of vicious jabs and hooks. While employers can’t eliminate all workplace injuries, they can take common-sense measures to reduce them by strictly limiting rounds to three minutes each.” The study also found that nearly 100 hours of productivity are lost each year to employees crowding around pairs of sparring coworkers and shouting bets."
"Bleary-Eyed, Stuporous Houseguest Assures Host That He Slept Great",1/25/16,611,"PITTSBURGH—Providing several reassurances about the quality of his previous night’s rest, bleary-eyed, stuporous houseguest Ken Hodge informed host Jeremy Muller this morning that he slept really great, sources confirmed. “Yeah, I was pretty comfy,” said the drowsy, sluggish 29-year-old, who restlessly tossed and turned throughout the night while attempting to find a comfortable sleeping position on the sagging cushions of Muller’s sofa. “That’s a nice couch. I was out like a light.” At press time, Hodge confirmed that the scratchy blanket that barely covered his entire body had kept him “nice and cozy.”"
Man Dying From Cancer Spends Last Good Day On Phone With Insurance Company,1/19/16,1421,"TOLEDO, OH—Displaying a level of strength and mobility that he will never again possess as he paced back and forth across his living room Tuesday, terminally ill man Thomas Halverson reportedly spent the last good day of his life on the phone with his insurance company. According to reports, the 56-year-old with Stage III liver cancer spent much of the morning and afternoon—a period in which he, for the last time ever, maintained a good appetite, a sufficiently functional immune system, and a reasonable level of energy—arguing a claim denial with nearly a dozen representatives across multiple departments, and on two separate occasions, starting his call over from the beginning after being suddenly disconnected. Sources confirmed that Halverson, who will in a matter of weeks be unable to get out of bed unassisted by nursing staff or carry on a conversation with his loved ones without them wondering whether it would be their last, could be seen during an hour-long wait on hold putting his phone on speaker mode while he, still able, stepped out onto his back deck momentarily to enjoy the fresh air. At press time, upon having his call transferred back to the very first representative he spoke with some five hours earlier, sources reported that Halverson could be overheard raising his voice and cursing loudly, the final time he’ll be able to do so without descending into a severely painful coughing fit."
"Study Links Binge Eating To Stress, Contentment, Depression, Joy, Boredom, Anger, Relaxation",1/13/16,1397,"DURHAM, NC—Providing insight into the potential causes underlying the unhealthy behavior, a Duke University study released Wednesday has discovered a strong correlation between binge eating and feelings of stress, contentment, depression, joy, boredom, anger, and relaxation. “Our data indicate that a highly positive, negative, or completely neutral emotional state is associated with a drastic increase in the quantity of food a person will consume in a single sitting,” said the study’s lead author, Helen Ermel, who noted that feelings of anxiety, self-confidence, embarrassment, grief, relief, hostility, composure, envy, pity, pride, and regret were also found to be linked to overeating. “We observed that subjects are likely to eat twice or even three times as much as is considered healthy if they have a particularly heavy workload, if they have absolutely no work to do at all, if they are satisfied with the direction in which their career and relationships are going, if they feel their life is meaningless and all their efforts have thus far been useless, if they’ve had a long and mentally taxing day, if they’ve had a pleasant or rewarding experience, or if they just woke up. And these correlations appear to be extremely robust.” The study further found that people are most prone to overeat during lunch, breakfast, dinner, brunch, afternoon or late-night snacking, and dessert."
Saudi Executioner Thinks He Pulled Something In Shoulder During Last 10 Decapitations,1/07/16,1040,"AL MUZAHIMIYAH, SAUDI ARABIA—Complaining that he must have “tweaked it pretty good,” Saudi executioner Khalid al-Faraj told reporters Thursday that he thinks he pulled something in his shoulder during yesterday’s last 10 decapitations. “Around the seventh or eighth beheading I came around kind of awkwardly on my windup and heard this loud pop, and I knew immediately that something wasn’t right, ” said al-Faraj, adding that he attempted to ignore the dull pain spreading through his upper right arm and power through the rest of the executions, but he barely had enough strength left to make a clean slice on the final prisoner. “When I got home I took a few Aleve and put some Icy Hot on it, but this morning when I woke up I couldn’t even lift my arm and the pain had spread down to my elbow. I just hope the swelling goes down soon because I’ve got a pretty big slate on Monday.” Al-Faraj told reporters that, on the orders of his orthopedist, he would have to miss out on this weekend’s public stoning of a woman accused of adultery."
"World Health Organization Adds Gunfire, Explosions To List Of Natural Causes Of Death",1/06/16,1346,"GENEVA—Explaining that fatalities attributable to such afflictions had become prevalent among a wide variety of populations across the globe, the World Health Organization announced Wednesday that the group had added gunfire and explosions to its official list of natural causes of death. “As we compile data going forward, any individual whose death results from a mass shooting, bombing, or any combination of the two will be considered as having succumbed to natural causes,” said WHO director-general Margaret Chan, noting that fatal wounds caused by bullets, shrapnel, and other ricocheting debris would be counted alongside heart disease, organ failure, and other age-associated diseases as natural threats to the human body. “Suffering multiple gunshot wounds or being in the vicinity of a suicide bomber, car bomb, or IED are completely commonplace maladies faced by people of all ages and ethnicities. Statistically, it no longer makes sense for us to include them with accidents, drownings, or any other non-natural causes of death.” Chan added that the organization would launch a campaign aimed at raising awareness among individuals especially at risk of contracting fatal gunfire and explosions, including the young, adults, the elderly, residents in urban and rural areas, and those in both industrialized and impoverished nations."
Dementia Patient’s Family Keeps Ripping Her Away From Idyllic World Of 1950s,12/11/15,1191,"VERO BEACH, FL—Frequently reminding her that the year is 2015 and that she no longer lives in suburban Pennsylvania, the family of dementia sufferer Evelyn Parker, 84, keeps brutally ripping her away from the soothing, idyllic world of the 1950s, sources confirmed Friday. “No, don’t you remember, Grandma? Bill’s gone now. He passed in 1998,” said Parker’s granddaughter Denise Wiley, jarring the woman from the blissful surroundings of a joyous family dinner around the dining room table of their newly purchased Levitt house in prosperous postwar America, and thrusting her back into the present moment in which her health, her mobility, and nearly every one of her joys in life had long since disappeared. “This isn’t Dellwood Avenue, Grammy. You haven’t lived in that neighborhood for almost 60 years. Just look around. You moved to Florida decades ago. See?” Wiley then reportedly spent 10 minutes trying to force her grandmother to take a medication that would dissolve away her evening’s plan of attending the premiere of Singin’ In The Rain with the charming, handsome young man who was courting her, and instead leave her sitting by herself in her small nursing facility apartment."
Study Finds Majority Of Accidental Heroin Overdoses Could Be Prevented With Less Heroin,12/07/15,997,"BALTIMORE—According to a study published Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the majority of the nearly 9,000 accidental heroin overdoses that occur in the U.S. each year could easily be prevented if the victim were to take less heroin. “Our data clearly showed that, in more than 95 percent of cases, had the individual used a smaller amount of heroin than they actually did, their chances of overdosing on heroin would have been significantly lowered,” said the study’s co-author Natalie Czerbett, adding that the results were the same regardless of whether a reduced quantity of the drug was snorted, smoked, or injected. “While these findings are by no means a silver bullet, I think it’s fairly conclusive that putting less heroin into your body is a highly effective preventative measure against overdosing on heroin.” Czerbett suggested that further research was needed to determine whether heroin overdoses could be reduced even further by mixing the drug with less cocaine."
Greg Hardy Assures Tony Romo He’s Seen Ex-Girlfriends Come Back From Far Worse Injuries,12/02/15,1022,"DALLAS—In an effort to comfort the recovering quarterback after a broken collarbone sidelined him for the season, Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy reportedly assured Tony Romo Wednesday that he has seen plenty of ex-girlfriends come back from far more serious injuries. “I know you’re feeling down right now, but listen, I’ve seen exes make full recoveries after being in much worse shape than you, trust me,” said Hardy, promising that if his last three girlfriends were all able to get back to normal following months of extensive physical therapy, there was no way a hairline fracture would keep Romo out for long. “I remember a girlfriend in college who got hurt really bad—Amanda actually ended up needing surgery—but she powered through it and eventually regained all the mobility in her shoulder. Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right?” At press time, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had praised Hardy as “a fantastic teammate” and offered the defensive lineman a new five-year, $89 million contract."
Grandmother Down To 10-Step Radius Around Recliner In Den,11/10/15,1077,"MARTINSBURG, MD—Noting that most rooms of her home are now effectively off-limits to her, the family of local grandmother Edith Wilson confirmed this week that the 84-year-old is down to a 10-step radius around her recliner in the den. “A few years ago, she could get around the whole ground floor of her house no problem, but now she can’t even make it to her sewing table where she used to pause to hold herself up,” said youngest son Todd Wilson, who noted that all his mother’s most important items—notably her Kleenex, hard candies, pill organizer, Woman’s Day magazines, and glucose monitor—had been relocated to shelves and end tables within several shambles of her tan, overstuffed chair. “She’s still within shuffling distance of the bathroom, which is good. But if this keeps up, we’re probably going to have to move everything she needs within arm’s reach of her chair pretty soon.” Wilson added that his mother was scheduled to have knee surgery later this year, which he hoped would eventually allow her to traverse all the way to the far side of the room at will."
CVS Cashier Can’t Wait To Accept $20 Bill From Customer Purchasing 3 Different Cough Medications,11/05/15,1194,"LANSING, MI—Having watched with mounting excitement as the pallid, sniffling man made his way toward her register from the pharmacy section, local CVS cashier Hannah Everson told reporters Thursday she was overjoyed at the prospect of accepting a $20 bill from a customer purchasing three different kinds of cough medicine. “Oh, boy, I can’t wait to get my hands on that damp twenty—if I’m lucky, he’ll use his clenched fist to cover a small coughing fit before reaching for his wallet,” said Everson, adding that she hoped the man slowly placing cough syrup, throat lozenges, and sinus medication on the counter would at least wipe his nose on the back of his hand before grabbing the bill and handing it over. “I was a little upset that he didn’t sneeze right in front of me when he reached the head of the line, but thankfully, just as he was stepping up to my register, he pulled out a crumpled, used tissue from his pocket, held it to his face, and blew his nose for about 30 continuous seconds. That was an unexpected treat!” Everson added that she could barely contain her elation at the promise of receiving a handful of warm, sticky coins after the man assured her he had exact change."

Stomach Sets Aside Synthetic Additives Until It Has A Few Minutes To Figure Out How To Digest Them,10/22/15,1208,"BROKEN ARROW, OK—Admitting it had no idea what it was supposed to do with the dozens of preservatives and flavor enhancers, the stomach of local man Shawn Harper reportedly set aside the synthetic additives that the 33-year-old consumed during lunch Thursday until it had a few minutes to figure out how to properly digest them. “Oh, man, I don’t even know where to begin with this stuff—I’m just going to focus on the protein and basic carbohydrates before I even start to think about how to break down any of these artificial sweeteners and colorings,” reported Harper’s stomach, adding that the significant volumes of aspartame, BHA, sodium nitrate, and azodicarbonamide would just have to wait until the organ could summon every possible enzyme to sift through them all. “Boy, this is really going to take some work; I haven’t even seen some of this stuff before. Plus, I’ve still got to deal with all that FD&C Yellow No. 5 that’s just been sitting around since breakfast. Hmm. This stuff looks like it’ll probably slide out of the body fast anyway, so maybe I should just wave it all through.” At press time, Harper’s overwhelmed stomach had concluded it was probably best to vomit up the entire thing."
Aging Mother Knows Any Wrong Move Could Be Taken For Telltale Sign Of Dementia,10/13/15,4427,"TACOMA, WA—Remarking upon the enormous caution she now takes before saying or doing anything in the presence of a loved one, local mother Sharon Powell, 64, told reporters Tuesday she knows any wrong move she makes could be interpreted by her family as a telltale sign of dementia. Powell claimed that even the simplest memory lapse, such as momentarily forgetting a distant relative’s name or losing track of what day of the week it is, might cause her children to worry that her mental state is in decline, setting into motion an irreversible series of events that would end with her moving into an assisted-care facility.
 “I make sure I place my keys in the exact same spot 100 percent of the time. And I always speak at a steady, even pace—too fast and I might trip over a word, too slow and they might think I’m struggling to come up with the right words.” “I have to be on top of my game every single day, because if I start slipping up, it’s only a matter of time before they put me in a home,” said Powell, who explained that she keeps her calendar by her side whenever she speaks on the phone with family members so she can recall without hesitation the date and time of any upcoming appointment, social event, or anniversary when it’s brought up. “I make sure I place my keys in the exact same spot 100 percent of the time. And I always speak at a steady, even pace—too fast and I might trip over a word, too slow and they might think I’m struggling to come up with the right words.”
 “Next week, I’m helping with my grandson Bradley’s ninth birthday, and I know that if I mess up one detail, if I get the wrong kind of frosting or forget the streamers, I’m as good as gone,” she added.
 The catalyst for Powell’s concerns was reportedly an incident last Christmas in which she mistook her son’s cell phone for her own, accidentally dialing a number from it. While chastising herself for the small oversight, she noticed her son whispering something to her youngest daughter in the hallway and immediately wondered if they were discussing whether her blunder was a symptom of Alzheimer’s.
 Ever since, Powell said, she has altered her behavior to avoid any situation that puts her at risk of appearing confused or forgetful, including cleaning up the slightest signs of clutter, carefully familiarizing herself with the settings on her newly purchased microwave, and double-checking to make sure she hasn’t left even one unpaid bill sitting on her kitchen counter.
 “I manage well enough during calls with the kids, but Thanksgiving’s coming up and I’m going to have to be on my toes for four straight days with everyone around,” said Powell, who confirmed that, out of increasing fear that the error would be “the one that does [her] in,” she would be setting multiple timers so she could be absolutely certain she does not burn the turkey. “If I so much as call my grandson by his father’s name in a moment of absentmindedness, there goes my independence. And if I don’t happen to hear everything that one of my kids says to me, there’s no way I’m asking them to repeat it—I’ll just be sticking to a general response of ‘That’s nice,’ making sure I maintain eye contact and deliver those words with confidence.”
 “Maybe I should leave some finished crossword puzzles lying around for people to find just in case,” she continued.
 Powell went on to state that she must be neatly dressed and perfectly groomed at all times, as any slight inattention to personal care could arouse suspicions of a deteriorating mind. She also noted that after rolling her ankle last week, she avoided contact with her family for several days, fearing they would take her accident as proof that a cognitive impairment was causing her to lose her sense of balance, and that she was in danger of taking a more serious fall at any moment.
 “I’ve stopped driving with my kids, because I know a single wrong turn might get them talking about whether it’s time to take my license away,” Powell said. “The last time I went shopping with my daughters, I missed the exit to the mall, and I swear I saw Rebecca raise an eyebrow and exchange glances with Allison. I must be on pretty thin ice already, and one more slip-up could get me carted off to assisted-living.”
 “Regardless, though, it’s good for me to keep up these habits,” she added. “That way, when I actually start losing my senses, I’ll already be really good at covering up for it.”"

"You Get Into This Business For The Ear And The Nose, But The Throat Grows On You",9/22/15,4618,"I’m often asked by acquaintances and patients about how I decided on my medical specialty, and, as much as I’m reluctant to admit it now with all the perspective I’ve gained after more than 20 years in the field, I can tell you that it certainly wasn’t because I loved every aspect of this line of work—not even close. As anyone in my profession will admit, you get into this business for two reasons and two reasons only: the ear and the nose. The throat? Well, that’s a different story altogether. But here’s the thing: Over time, bit by bit, the throat really grows on you. Back in med school, I couldn’t have been less interested in the throat—it just seemed like this big, boring tube. Let’s face it, after you get past the epiglottis and the tonsils, it’s nothing but esophagus until you hit the stomach. Naturally, my attitude was, “Who cares?” At the time, it was all about that perfect amalgam of bones and cartilage that make up the nose and the incredibly intricate inner and outer structures of the ear. When it came to the ho-hum throat, I made it a point to plow through those tedious textbook chapters as fast as possible so I could get back to noses and ears. The throat may not be as flashy as its more notable counterparts, but over time, it wins you over with its subtle beauty and humble, workmanlike mechanics. In fact, I find myself more intrigued and beguiled by the throat each day. In fact, while suffering through yet another seemingly endless throat-based lecture, I recall asking the instructor why we were spending so much time on painfully dull chronic pharyngitis when the amazing worlds of nasal polyps and external otitis of the ear awaited us. When he cryptically answered, “Ask me that same question 10 years from now,” and winked before continuing on with the class, I just brushed it off. And why wouldn’t I? I was a cocky kid fresh out of my family practice rotation who thought he had it all figured out. But how right that instructor was! The throat may not be as flashy as its more notable counterparts, but over time, it wins you over with its subtle beauty and humble, workmanlike mechanics. In fact, I find myself more intrigued and beguiled by the throat each day. It’s hard to say exactly when I started to turn a corner on the throat. I can tell you that I still feel the same excitement today when I’m prepping for a flexible fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy as I did my very first time over two decades ago. And I’m not ashamed to admit that when I’m doing an ear exam, I’ll often pause between the left and the right, turn off my otoscope for a second, and thank my lucky stars that I’m able to make a living doing this. But the throat—the throat really snuck up on me. Maybe 12 or 13 years ago, I began to notice instances when I stopped mindlessly going through the motions while assessing a run-of-the-mill thyroglossal abnormality, and instead found myself truly enjoying flagging it for removal and biopsy. Other moments, I would catch myself lingering a little too long on a vestibular fold here, an elegant hyoid bone there. And over the past few years, I can’t count the number of times I’ve caught myself staring rapt past the palatoglossal arch and into that dark, empty cavity, admiring the upper esophageal sphincter, the glint of the light on the stratified squamous epithelium, reveling in an entire world that I had for so many years looked right past. So, I’ll say it, even though there was a time I never in a million years thought I would: I love the throat. In fact, I’d say it’s almost as good as the sinuses. And when I look at my calendar now and there isn’t at least a streptococcal infection or two sprinkled in throughout the day, I genuinely get a little disappointed. Of course, let’s not go totally overboard here. No matter how many cases of candidiasis, papillomatosis, or laryngopharyngeal reflux I get to see, they’ll never top the glitzier diseases of the ear, or even the nose for that matter. I’m sorry, but as much as I’ve come to revere the anatomical structure, no throat, no matter how unique the malady affecting it, could ever live up to the overwhelming adrenaline rush of an ear with endolymphatic hydrops or a nose with a septal hematoma. Maybe it’s not really productive to think about it in those terms, though; it’s like comparing apples and oranges, right? Because as much of a visceral thrill as you get from the ear and nose, the acquired taste that is the throat can fulfill you on an entirely different level. I guess you get out of the throat what you put into it. But isn’t that true of most of the best things in life?"
Luke Kuechly Undergoes Quick Brain Arthroscopy To Clean Up Cerebral Cortex,9/17/15,1119,"CHARLOTTE, NC—After suffering a concussion that sidelined him against the Jacksonville Jaguars last weekend, the Carolina Panthers announced Thursday that All-Pro linebacker Luke Kuechly has undergone a quick brain arthroscopy in order to clean up his cerebral cortex. “Earlier today, we successfully scoped Luke’s brain and removed some buildup of tissue that had been accumulating in there,” said team doctor Donald Randolph, explaining that several small incisions were made in Kuechly’s forehead to allow surgeons to go into his cerebrum and remove loose tissue and bone fragments, as well as shave away the worn areas of his frontal and temporal lobes. “There was actually quite a bit of fluid inside Luke’s skull that had to be drained, and hopefully that will alleviate some discomfort. And as long as he continually ices it for the next 24 to 48 hours, the swelling in his head should be gone by Sunday.” Randolph stressed, however, that the surgery was a temporary solution aimed at pain management and recommended that Kuechly undergo a more invasive procedure in the offseason to replace his torn brain stem."

Sometimes I feel as if my husband does not communicate how he truly feels about me or my body, and I have a hard time discussing this with him. Will this pill solve that?
A: Yes. Q: Are there other alternatives for women?
A: Physicians have found equal efficacy in raising libido from reading The Cowboy’s Touch, Going Cowboy Crazy, or To Kiss A Texan. Q: Will insurance cover Flibanserin?
A: Hold on there, little dreamer! Let’s work on basic contraception first."
Underworld Health Organization Launches Initiative To Improve Incubus Immortality Rate,8/19/15,933,"THE SECOND CIRCLE, HELL—Affirming the need to reverse the trend after several millennia of discouraging numbers, officials from the Underworld Health Organization unveiled a new initiative Thursday to improve Hades’ incubus immortality rate. “It is simply unacceptable in this day and age that so many of our demon spawn never get the chance to metamorphose into evil spirits who spend all of eternity raping human women as they sleep,” said UHO spokesman Belphegor, adding that in certain lower circles of damnation, as many as 80 out of every 10,000 hatchlings do not go on to stalk the Earth for the rest of time. “If our initiative is successful, we can finally put an end to the tragic and all-too-common occurrence of a bright young incubus dying before he reaches his 1,000th birthday.” After laying out the plan, Belphegor reportedly avoided a question on its projected budget by bursting into 500 snakes and slithering away."
Body Breaking Down In Totally Different Order Than Man Expected,8/13/15,1130,"ANDOVER, MA—While saying he’d always known that “everything would fall apart eventually,” 45-year-old Bruce Lifschitz admitted his surprise to reporters Friday that his body was breaking down in a completely different order than he expected it would. “I’ve had knee pain since I was in my 20s, so I honestly thought those would be the first to cause me real problems, but nope; my back completely gave out on me out of nowhere, and now I can’t move between a sitting and standing position without it flaring up,” said Lifschitz, adding that he had also previously predicted he would be fully bald by this point, but noted with astonishment that his ongoing hair loss had been outpaced by his chronic heartburn and sharply increasing blood pressure. “I thought it was going to go: knees first, then hair, then prostate, and then maybe eyesight and memory after that. I hadn’t even considered that these stomach ulcers would come up. At this point, I really can’t say which part of me is going to give way next.” Lifschitz noted that, for what it’s worth, his arms were doing great and didn’t seem in danger of failing anytime soon."

Oretsky, who can’t even go five minutes without rubbing everyone’s face in his gratitude for being alive, has reportedly taken every possible opportunity to pat himself on the back for being cancer-free for the first time since 2013.
 “Since beating cancer, I feel like I have a new lease on life,” boasted Oretsky during yet another of his unbelievably self-aggrandizing stories about having a normal white blood cell count. “I feel great, and my energy and appetite are back—even just doing mundane things like taking a walk or doing the dishes have this added significance now that I’m healthy.”

 “At my lowest, it was tough going, for sure,” the out-of-control narcissist said, implying in so many words that everyone should bow down to his greatness for dealing with months of radiation treatments, chemotherapy, and daily medications. “But I would think of my family and how I wasn’t done spending time with them yet. That’s what got me through.”

 Additionally, Oretsky, who at one point was given a 50-50 chance of survival, has wasted no time ramming his new life goals straight down everyone’s throats. Pompously citing his “clean bill of health,” the smug fuck is said to be incredibly adept at bringing any conversation back around to his selfish plans to travel to Europe, learn another language, and still be around to see his children graduate from college.
 “If this experience has taught me one thing, it’s that we have to live our lives without regret,” said Oretsky, who amazingly was still able to speak, given how far he was up his own ass. “Because one day when you least expect it, it could all be taken away.”
 “We only have this one life,” Mr. Look-At-Me-I-Beat-Cancer added, flashing his trademark shit-eating grin. “We have to make the most of it.”

Dementia Study Reveals Fond Memories First To Go,6/16/15,5375,"BALTIMORE—Researchers at Johns Hopkins University published a new study this week on the cognitive effects of Alzheimer’s disease and other deteriorative brain disorders, finding conclusive evidence that dementia sufferers’ fondest memories are nearly always the first to go. The five-year study, which followed a group of nearly 3,000 individuals diagnosed with dementia, found that as neurons and dendritic connections in the cerebral cortex are degraded by the disease, patients’ most positive recollections—such as falling in love for the first time or the overwhelming, indescribable joy of holding one’s firstborn child just moments after their birth—are eradicated much more rapidly than other types of memories.
 “It appears that the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain, which underlies most forms of dementia, first affects the specific memory centers responsible for retaining the subject’s most treasured reminiscences,” said neurologist David Trapp, who noted that during the earliest stages of the disease, patients typically lose all recollection of their most prized personal and professional successes in life. “At acute risk are memories along the lines of the heart-stopping exhilaration of that first kiss at summer camp those many years ago, as the sun slowly set out over the lake and caught the water in just such a way, almost like the lake was on fire. In fact, that type of memory is erased almost immediately.”
 “The moment you notice the first signs of dementia in a loved one, you can be certain that the majority of memories that give them any feeling of pleasure, pride, or personal fulfillment have already been forever expunged from their mind.” “And memory loss progresses quickly from there,” Trapp continued. “The moment you notice the first signs of dementia in a loved one, you can be certain that the majority of memories that give them any feeling of pleasure, pride, or personal fulfillment have already been forever expunged from their mind.”
 Trapp added that the happier and more life-affirming a particular memory is, the faster it will be claimed by the neuropathology of dementia. Remembrances of proudly walking through the front door of one’s newly purchased home or of triumphantly marching down the Champs-Élysées with the knowledge of having helped defeat the greatest evil the world has ever known are typically lost within a few weeks of being diagnosed with the condition.
 According to the study, brain regions associated with memories of love, smiling, accomplishment, unmitigated joy, comfort, interpersonal tenderness, physical pleasure, beloved childhood pets, and self-respect appeared to be the first targeted by memory-destroying neural plaques.
 “In fact, just the act of trying to recall the brightest days of one’s youth—to recapture some small sense of the profound satisfaction that came from learning and discovering and experiencing new things, of the very essence of what is good about being alive—greatly accelerates the process,” Trapp said. “We found that the more subjects attempted to think back to their carefree college years or their childhood escapades with friends over summer breaks, the faster these memories vanished, never to be recalled again.”
 In addition to decimating those memories most important and sustaining to the patient, the degenerative effects of dementia seemed to spare the vast majority of the humiliating and unhappy moments from its victims’ lives, the study found, leaving them fully intact as the remainder of one’s store of memories steadily deteriorated and disappeared.
 “Even after subjects were robbed of their ability to recognize loved ones and the basic skills necessary to feed and clean themselves, the worst of their memories persisted,” said Dr. Emily Braun, a neurobiologist at Columbia University who contributed to the study. “Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that areas of the brain that retain, for example, the memory of walking in on one’s oldest and most trusted friend engaged in passionate intercourse with one’s wife or of suddenly being stricken with uncontrollable diarrhea while giving a presentation at a sales conference continue to light up well after the other cortical regions have gone silent.”
 “And with complex emotional imprints, such as those stemming from a long relationship with one’s spouse or children, it seems dementia selectively destroys neural circuitry related to the positive aspects of the memories in question, leaving behind only the trauma, pain, and disappointment related to these experiences,” Braun added. “Although more research is necessary, it appears as though the most awful recollections actually become crisper and more vivid to the patient as the disease advances.”
 As dementia reaches its terminal stages, Braun confirmed that bitter and displeasing recollections begin to erode as well, eventually leaving each individual with only a solitary, recursive synaptic pathway comprising their single most negative memory. This instance is said to be relived in a perpetual loop, to the exclusion of all other high-level cognitive functioning.
 “In their final months, it seems that dementia patients are left with just one exceedingly agonizing memory and nothing else,” Braun said. “In their mind’s eye, the very worst moment of their entire life is the last thing they’ll ever see.”"
FDA Approves Female-Libido-Enhancing Man,6/09/15,1162,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to address the needs of women suffering from a lack of sexual desire, the FDA announced Tuesday that it had approved a new female-libido-enhancing man, which is expected to be made available to the general public by year’s end. “After conducting numerous trials on hundreds of female subjects with low sex drives, we determined that this man significantly increased sexual interest among women of all ages,” said FDA representative Jane Newlon, who noted that using the 75kg man, known as Gabriel, every day had been shown to activate the regions of the brain associated with pleasure, increase blood flow to the genitals, and boost instances of orgasm by almost 40 percent. “We observed a sharp rise in libido immediately after the man is introduced, with stimulative effects lasting for up to four hours at a time. In a marketplace dominated by male-libido-enhancing products, it is a significant milestone to finally have a safe, effective option for women who want to increase their arousal, and that is exactly what this man offers.” Newlon went on to warn consumers that when mixed with alcohol, the man becomes much less effective."
New Claritin Flamethrower Incinerates Whatever Causing Allergies,6/04/15,996,"WHIPPANY, NJ—Touting the product’s ability to combat common seasonal and year-round allergens, pharmaceutical manufacturer Bayer introduced Wednesday its new Claritin flamethrower capable of incinerating whatever is causing one’s allergies. “Our new flamethrower is proven to be effective at relieving itchy eyes, sneezing, and congestion by quickly and efficiently reducing dust mites, pollen, and other allergy-causing agents to smoldering ashes,” said company spokesperson Elaine Ferguson, adding that the product is available in either a regular 25-foot or an Extra Strength 50-foot jet of fire—ideal for eliminating ragweed, trees, grasses, and entire mold-ridden homes. “With this over-the-counter treatment, you can simply look at the latest allergy forecast, strap on the Claritin fuel pack, and wipe out allergy-inducing plants and pets without a hint of drowsiness.” Due to potential side effects, Ferguson cautioned that the Claritin flamethrower should never be combined with alcohol."
Scientists Make Unclear Breakthrough After Giving Robot Cancer,5/29/15,4139,"STANFORD, CA—Theorizing that their work most likely represents a groundbreaking scientific achievement of some kind, researchers at Stanford University announced Thursday that they have made an unclear breakthrough by giving a robot cancer. The team of oncologists and mechanical engineers told reporters that after years of research and repeated trials, they had finally succeeded in causing an aggressive form of advanced cancer to spread throughout a laboratory robot’s mechanized arm and central processing unit, noting that this landmark accomplishment probably has beneficial implications for the scientific community or society at large “or something like that.” “Right now, what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease.” “Diagnostic testing has confirmed that our robot has developed a high concentration of malignancies throughout its entire structural framework, which, for all we know, could turn out to be incredibly important to science,” said lead researcher Amos Cruise, noting that the degenerative disease is corroding the machine’s circuitry at a rapid rate, a development that he stated might potentially lead to further advancements in cancer research or robotics or maybe electrical engineering. “Never before has cancer been detected in a non-biological entity, which seems like a pretty big achievement to me. I mean, it took three years of experimentation just to get cancer to take hold inside a robot, and anything that requires that much effort probably ends up being pretty useful, I imagine.” “Right now, what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease,” Cruise added. “That alone has got to be some sort of leap forward in our understanding of terminal illnesses. Right?” According to Cruise, after introducing cancerous neoplasms into the robot’s microprocessors, the disease eventually metastasized from its motherboard to its sensor modules and chassis, an unprecedented expansion that researchers said had never been observed before and therefore would have to be categorized as a success in some sense. Just six weeks later, the Stanford team reported that the disease had completely disabled the robot’s optical and pneumatic systems in a progression that several of the project’s top epidemiologists haltingly called a watershed moment in “whatever scientific discipline covers this sort of thing.” Additionally, sources confirmed that the rapidly proliferating disease had degraded the integrity of the unit’s electrical wiring by 70 percent, with Cruise asserting that, while such a development didn’t immediately suggest any practical applications for cancer treatment, it certainly seemed like something worth noting. He added that initial tests have revealed that the robot’s cancer is inoperable, which he stressed was probably a pretty meaningful detail as well. “We’ve begun administering an aggressive course of chemotherapy drugs and are putting the robot through daily radiotherapy sessions to see how it responds to the treatment, because we figured, you know, that seemed like a pretty logical thing to do at this point,” said Cruise, noting that while the robot’s condition continues to decline, monitoring its reaction to concentrated doses of toxic radiation “might be one of those things that pays off somewhere down the line.” “Meanwhile, we’re also applying for additional funding in order to someday replicate our findings in other robots by giving them cancer, and maybe some other diseases too. That’s the type of thing we usually do during projects like this, so I guess we’ll try that and see how it goes. Can’t hurt.” “Maybe if we can build a robot that already has cancer, it could…” he added, before trailing off. When reached for further comment, Stanford’s research team confirmed that, in what just has to be a crucial finding for artificial intelligence or possibly a related field, they have determined that the robot is fully aware it has cancer and is in constant pain."

"Gym Teacher Devises Elaborate Sport From Handful Of Foam Cubes, Scooters, Plastic Mats",4/24/15,1055,"MIDDLETON, WI—Spending the first 15 minutes of class providing an overview of the game’s litany of complicated rules, local ninth-grade gym teacher Marcus Hartwell invented an elaborate sport Friday using just foam cubes, scooters, and plastic mats, sources confirmed. “All right, guys, so to score in Jammer Ball, you need to shoot the foam blocks at the other team’s mat,” said Hartwell, adding that teams receive one point for cubes landing on either the left or right sections of the large blue folding mat, and three points if a cube lands in the middle. “If you fall off your scooter, then you’re out, unless your goalie catches a cube thrown by the other team and tags you back in. And if you shoot a cube into the basketball hoop, you automatically win. Okay, let’s count off by fours and make teams.” At press time, after students had expressed some initial indifference and confusion, the game had reportedly gotten so intense that Hartwell had to separate two ninth-graders on the verge of fighting after pushing one another off their scooters."
Study Finds Those With Deceased Family Members At High Risk Of Dying Themselves,4/22/15,3044,"BOSTON—Pinpointing the phenomenon as the single greatest predictor of human mortality, a paper published Wednesday in The New England Journal Of Medicine has found that people with deceased family members run an extremely high risk of dying themselves. The groundbreaking study, which tracked the health and well-being of 85,000 subjects over a period of 40 years, discovered that people who have one or more relatives who have passed away are very likely, one day, to die as well. “It appears that individuals with a family history of death have a strong genetic predisposition toward dying,” said the paper’s lead author, Dr. Samantha Booth, who explained that the finding held true regardless of a subject’s race, nationality, gender, or socioeconomic status. “Based on anecdotal evidence, we’ve long suspected an inherited trait could play a major role in determining whether a person dies, but we were surprised to see just how strong the correlation truly is.” “Unfortunately, for members of this cohort, death appears to be all but inevitable,” she continued. According to the study’s authors, the likelihood of future mortality remains high regardless of whether one’s immediate family members have died, or whether only more distant relations have passed on. Based on their findings, researchers hypothesize that death is handed down through individual lineages, becoming a devastating family curse that is passed from parent to child and which tends not to skip a generation. In addition, a separate study of some 8,000 individuals who died in the Hartford, CT area found that every one of the deceased had ancestors who had died before them, further suggesting a family link. While people from afflicted lineages can reportedly prolong their lives by developing healthy habits such as a nutritious diet and regular exercise, researchers stated that, in the end, no matter how many precautions they take, their genetic susceptibility to dying will win out. “We recommend alerting your doctor if there’s a history of death in your family, and if you aren’t certain, you should ask your parents if they know of any fatalities among your relatives,” Booth said. “This is also important information to know before deciding to have children yourself. Even if your own family is alive and well, it’s possible there is death somewhere in your partner’s ancestry.” “If you have a grandparent or even a great-grandparent who has died, then sadly, the odds of your kids eventually dying are quite high,” she added. When reached for comment, several of the study’s participants acknowledged they had at least one deceased family member, and expressed their fear and concern to reporters. “I feel perfectly healthy now, but knowing that my father died definitely makes me worry that the same thing could happen to me one day,” said Randy Lewis, a 49-year-old who took part in the study. “But my mom is still alive, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I take after her side of the family.” Added Lewis, “Unfortunately, I can only wait and see.”"

"FDA Figures It Will Get Around To Regulating Supplements With Names Like Black Widow, Yellow Demon",4/09/15,1433,"WASHINGTON—Saying that keeping an eye on the billion-dollar industry probably couldn’t hurt, the Food and Drug Administration reportedly figured aloud Thursday that sooner or later it would get around to regulating supplements with names like Black Widow and Yellow Demon. “I guess it wouldn’t be a bad idea at some point to assess the safety of products like energy pills that have a highly venomous spider on the logo and promise to ‘give your system a jolt’ once we get a few things off our plate,” said FDA official Donald Reece, adding that when they had the time, the agency’s chemists should really give a quick once-over to currently unregulated dietary products featuring the words “carnage,” “napalm,” “or “Hemo-Rage” written on the package in bold, fluorescent letters. “Now that I think about it, it probably makes sense to do at least a cursory study on any substance that consists of wholly untested chemical compounds and 6,000 times the recommended daily allotment of certain rare minerals. And if the container has the letter ‘X’ formed by two intersecting lightning bolts or a grimacing skull with glowing eyes, that might be a good reason to inspect it one of these days.” Reece, who confirmed that the FDA intends to look into these products eventually, said that a high-profile teenage athlete overdosing on a bodybuilding supplement named something like Doomsday Assault could get the ball rolling a lot faster."

New Healthier Menu Features Food Wendy’s Customers Bring From Home,3/26/15,1050,"DUBLIN, OH—Responding to consumer demands for healthier offerings, Wendy’s announced this week the addition of its new Fit ‘N’ Fast menu, which features food that customers bring in from home to eat at the restaurant. “People still love Wendy’s classic old-fashioned hamburgers and Frosty desserts, but they also want to have fresh, low-calorie options, so we’ve decided to incorporate a variety of wholesome items that our diners prepare themselves,” said Wendy’s deputy marketing director Ralph Jones, telling reporters the fast food chain was proud to be including a wide assortment of heart-healthy, vegetarian, and nutritious homestyle choices for the very first time. “At each of our more than 6,500 locations, we’ll be making room for everything from lentil soup to mixed greens to baked salmon, all hand-selected by customers from their own refrigerators and brought directly to a table at Wendy’s.” Jones went on to state that with any Fit ‘N’ Fast meal customers could add fries and a 24-ounce soda, if they’re being honest with themselves."
Siblings Playing Tense Game Of Chicken To Decide Who Going To Care For Mom,3/23/15,1073,"POUGHKEEPSIE, NY—As they each attempted to avoid the responsibility while still upholding the appearance of selfless concern, the three adult siblings of the MacIntyre family engaged in a tense game of chicken to decide which of them would care for their aging mother, sources confirmed Monday. “Mom could probably come live with me—there’s a little more space in our house now that the kids are away at college,” said youngest sibling Alison MacIntyre, 54, who, after setting herself on a collision course to support her ailing mother for the foreseeable future, sat silently praying she might be spared the burden at the last second by a counteroffer from either her brother or her sister. “Of course, if the boys come back to live at home over the summer we’d all be a bit cramped for a few months, but it’ll be fine. I can probably manage it.” According to sources, as her children’s tense standoff continued indefinitely, 82-year-old Marjorie MacIntyre began to worry that no one would call her out on her repeated bluff that she could take care of herself on her own."
Scientists Discover Eating Serves Function Other Than Easing Anxiety,3/17/15,1205,"PROVIDENCE, RI—Shedding new light on the biological underpinnings behind the behavior, scientists at Brown University announced Tuesday that eating appears to serve a number of key functions besides relieving anxiety. “While a considerable portion of food is indeed ingested in order to distract an individual from feelings of panic and insecurity, our research shows that eating actually confers several benefits beyond temporarily holding despair at bay,” said Dr. Sandra Lutkin, who explained that consuming food has been found to provide vital nutrients to the human body and in many cases replenish it with energy, suggesting that its primary purpose may not be as a coping mechanism at all. “In fact, we observed dozens of subjects and discovered that only a portion of the items they ingested were intended to assuage their apprehension about their job, relationship, or body image. However, much more research must be conducted to learn more about these little-known, non-stress-relieving purposes of eating.” Although she cautioned the findings were tentative, Lutkin posited that there might be additional methods of eating besides frantically devouring a meal directly over a trash can or sink."

New Gym Member Lingers By Free Weights For Several Seconds Before Returning To Elliptical Machine,2/19/15,1050,"EAGAN, MN—After tentatively approaching the extensive rack of dumbbells located along the gym’s wall, new Bally Total Fitness member Brian Vinje was seen lingering in the vicinity of the free weights for several seconds Thursday before returning to the elliptical machine on which he had previously been exercising, onlookers reported. According to accounts, Vinje took roughly eight seconds to peruse the wide selection of weights, lightly touching the grip of a 20-pound dumbbell for a moment, before retreating a short distance and briefly pretending to become occupied by a poster of human musculature on the wall. While reportedly pausing to cast a furtive glance around the room, Vinje is said to have made fleeting eye contact with another gym-goer seated on a nearby bench, causing him, by all accounts, to abruptly jerk his gaze back to the rack and to scan it as if searching for a specific desired weight.

Tim Duncan Raving About Health Benefits Of Standing Bench,2/18/15,1118,"SAN ANTONIO—Explaining that it significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and promotes healthier metabolism, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly spent the majority of practice Wednesday extolling the numerous benefits of switching to a standing bench. “You can still watch the game, cheer for the team, and do everything else you normally do, but it’s so much healthier than sitting,” said Duncan, adding that players who use a traditional bench are far less productive while setting screens on the perimeter or getting down the floor during a fast break. “Sitting for 20 or 30 minutes every game really adds up over the season, and it could end up shortening your career by years. You’d be amazed at how much of a difference standing can even make to your general energy level, especially if you’re someone who tends to sit for long stretches of a half without ever getting up to sub in.” Duncan also urged head coach Gregg Popovich to always use a gel anti-fatigue mat, stressing the importance of providing sturdy, cushioned support for the feet and knees when drawing up plays during a timeout."

I guess he’s getting ready to put on his scrubs and head into the OR to perform a quadruple bypass.” At press time, Garton—the world-renowned open-heart surgeon himself—was drying his hands using a paper towel instead of just rubbing them on his jeans."
"New Study Finds Therapy, Antidepressants Equally Effective At Monetizing Depression",2/17/15,999,"NORMAN, OK—Noting that similar outcomes were achieved under both approaches, a landmark decade-long study of mental health treatment options published Tuesday has found that talk therapy and antidepressant medications are equally effective at monetizing clinical depression. “Our data indicate that regular counseling sessions and prescription drugs have similarly high success rates in generating large sums of money from the clinically depressed,” said Katherine Hutton of the University of Oklahoma, the study’s lead author, noting that both methods demonstrated consistent positive earnings across chronic, episodic, and seasonal depression cases. “While some people make tremendous profits with drugs, others see substantial revenues from therapy. Together, these are two very powerful tools for improving the health care industry’s bottom line.” The study concluded that when both approaches are combined, financial results are likely to be reached far more quickly than with one method alone."
Man’s Food Poisoning Could Realistically Be Traced Back To Any Meal From Past Week,2/12/15,965,"NEW YORK—Determining that not one of his recent food selections was entirely above suspicion, local man Kevin Curhan said Thursday that his food poisoning could realistically be pinned on any meal from the past week. “I had that leftover burrito for lunch yesterday, and that’d been sitting around in the fridge for a pretty long time, but then again, the milk I had that morning was also kinda off,” said Curhan, adding that the food from the $4.99 Chinese buffet and the fried eggs he realized were undercooked but went ahead and ate anyway could also be responsible for the overpowering nausea he was currently experiencing. “Then there were those turkey cold cuts I had Tuesday that were a couple of days expired. Those have to be at least part of it, don’t they? There’s probably a few other things I’m not thinking of, too.” At press time, Curhan was comfortable removing only a bowl of plain oatmeal consumed last Saturday from his list of possible culprits."
"Health Experts Recommend Standing Up At Desk, Leaving Office, Never Coming Back",2/06/15,1361,"ROCHESTER, MN—In an effort to help working individuals improve their fitness and well-being, experts at the Mayo Clinic issued a new set of health guidelines Thursday recommending that Americans stand up at their desk, leave their office, and never return. “Many Americans spend a minimum of eight hours per day sitting in an office, but we observed significant physical and mental health benefits in subjects after just one instance of standing up, walking out the door, and never coming back to their place of work again,” said researcher Claudine Sparks, who explained that those who implemented the practice in their lives reported an improvement in mood and reduced stress that lasted for the remainder of the day, and which appeared to persist even into subsequent weeks. “We encourage Americans to experiment with stretching their legs by strolling across their office and leaving all their responsibilities behind forever just one time to see how much better they feel. People tend to become more productive, motivated, and happy almost immediately. We found that you can also really get the blood flowing by pairing this activity with hurling your staff ID across the parking lot.” Sparks added that Americans could maximize positive effects by using their lunch break to walk until nothing looks familiar anymore and your old life is a distant memory."

Once they hear how large I was, their eyes just light up, and all they care about is asking to see my baby pictures so they can look at my big chubby cheeks.” At press time, sources confirmed that a coworker was interrupting Whitaker’s story about studying abroad for a year in Venice to say that his delivery must have been hell on his mother."

FDA Approves New Drug For Treating Pill Deficiencies,1/16/15,1124,"WASHINGTON—In what is being considered a major breakthrough for the millions of Americans suffering from a severe lack of capsules and tablets, the FDA announced Friday that it had approved a new drug for treating pill deficiencies. “After months of clinical testing, our studies show that regular usage of this drug provides an immediate boost to the number of caplets in the patient’s body,” said FDA spokesperson Anita Brown-Reed, noting that the fast-acting medication is safe for people of all ages who currently experience symptoms of pill shortage, such as seeing just one or two bottles of medicine in their bathroom cabinet or swallowing capsules twice a week or less. “Certainly those with dangerously low levels of pills may need to take a stronger dosage, possibly three or even four of these 500 mg tablets per day, based on their physician’s recommendation. Overall, however, this treatment appears to provide hope for the countless Americans who are currently living with an entire empty row in their pillbox.” Brown-Reed noted, however, that the new pill may leave patients with an increased risk of co-pays."
Personal Trainer Impressed By Man’s Improved Excuses,1/13/15,1198,"SAN JOSE, CA—Acknowledging that the progress made in such a short amount of time was remarkable, Club One Fitness personal trainer Logan Kaiser told reporters Tuesday he is very impressed by the improvement in both the strength and consistency of his client’s excuses. “He’s starting to come along; a few months ago he had really weak pretenses for not sticking to a workout plan, but he’s put in a lot of effort and now he’s sporting much more robust and powerful justifications,” said Kaiser of 36-year-old software engineer Jeffrey McGann, noting that the gym member’s exculpatory anecdotes had already tripled in size and were becoming far more difficult to verify. “After seeing how he struggled early on with a simple excuse about traffic, it’s gratifying to see him push himself and dig deep for rationalizations that more believably exonerate him. And you can tell it’s gotten a lot easier. His total commitment to tackling a long, grueling story about how construction in his neighborhood aggravated his dust mite allergies was outstanding.” At press time, Kaiser expressed concern after learning that McGann would be unable to make it to the gym due to an unspecified workplace emergency."
New Express Transplant List Offers Patients Kidney Or First Available Organ,12/02/14,3223,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to shorten the wait time for dialysis patients in need of a donor, the Department of Health and Human Services this week opened a new express transplant list to the public that matches candidates with either a kidney or any other organ at all. According to sources, the new system allows patients to select from a list of alternative organs, such as a heart, liver, or lung, that they would like to receive should a kidney be unavailable. By no longer restricting kidney patients to one specific donor organ, officials estimate that the average wait for transplant candidates will fall dramatically, from an average of three to five years to less than 24 hours. “With over 100,000 people currently unable to find kidney transplants, this expedited list will ensure that each and every one of them receives at least some type of organ in a timely manner,” said HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, adding that in some instances, patients have been ushered into surgery minutes after signing the registration form. “The long wait puts unnecessary stress on those who are already sick, so we hope to alleviate that pressure by quickly locating and implanting whatever we can get our hands on.” “Getting a kidney is ideal, but a pancreas can be a precious gift, too,” Burwell added. Whereas more than 4,000 people died annually while waiting for a transplant under the old system, the upgraded list has reportedly eliminated this problem completely, with every patient rapidly receiving a kidney or a more immediately obtainable organ. In addition to major organs, sources said the new protocols allow for kidneys to be replaced with tissue, such as nerve bundles or lumps of cartilage. The new list has reportedly drawn praise from patients, who have seen their anxiety vanish virtually overnight at the prospect of their diseased kidneys quickly being exchanged for more accessible body parts. “I was so sick of leaving my fate up in the air using the old system, never knowing if I’d get the transplant I needed in time,” said 58-year-old diabetic Janet Martin, who selected an intestinal tract, a thymus gland, and 17 other potential backups for the kidney she has been waiting on since 2010. “Now, I know there’s a 100 percent chance I’ll get a new organ, and there’s a 5 percent chance it’ll be the one I really want.” “That certainty means so much,” Martin added. “I don’t have to lie awake worrying—I’m getting a kidney or something else real soon.” But despite the speedy access to transplant organs provided by the new list, critics have alleged that more affluent individuals are offered their preferred kidney alternatives, while less well-off patients are consistently presented with their least desired options. “If I couldn’t get a kidney, I would have been fine with a gallbladder, a cornea, a spleen—a whole bunch of things,” said Christopher Corvese, 42, who suffers from a genetic condition that produces cysts in kidney tissue. “I bet if I were a millionaire, I’d probably get the heart valve I was really excited about. But, no, I got offered a face transplant, which was way, way at the bottom for me.” “I’ll take it, of course,” added Corvese. “I mean, it’s better than nothing.”"
Pacific Ocean Quarantined After Contact With Carnival Cruise Ship,11/17/14,1014,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to control the spread of a significant health threat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quarantined the Pacific Ocean Monday after the body of water reportedly came into contact with Carnival’s Crown Princess cruise ship. “This morning at 10:05 a.m., we confirmed direct exposure between the Pacific Ocean and a Carnival cruise liner, and we took immediate action to confine all 63.8 million square miles of its water,” said CDC director Thomas Frieden, adding that crews were erecting a biohazard tent over the area spanning from Tokyo Bay to the Los Angeles coastline. “The movement of all sea life will be highly restricted while the Pacific Ocean is closed off for a full 30-day monitoring period, during which time health officials will inspect the marine expanse for symptoms of any Carnival Cruise-based contagion.” Frieden expressed relief that officials had fortunately prepared for this possibility and caught the outbreak before any infected waves reached the shore."
Thrill-Seeking Man Wonders How Long He Can Keep Up Dangerous Sedentary Lifestyle,10/30/14,4291,"PHOENIX—Acknowledging that it’s only a matter of time before his high-risk pursuits finally catch up to him, local thrill-seeker Daniel Erickson told reporters Wednesday that he often wonders just how long he can keep up his extremely hazardous sedentary lifestyle. The 36-year-old IT specialist said that, while he lives for the exhilarating danger that comes from spending nearly every waking hour sitting at his computer, watching television, or playing with his smartphone in bed, he is fully aware that he is balancing on the razor’s edge with each passing, virtually immobile day. “I’m skating on thin ice living my life like this, but chasing after those extreme risks is just in my blood,” said Erickson, who noted that spending the vast majority of his time in a slumped or fully recumbent position is all part of the nonstop game of chance that he thrives on. “I know that if I keep tempting fate by stretching out on the sofa all day, I’ll eventually pay the price, but I’m not someone who can do things halfway. If I’m going to play with fire by lying across those cushions every chance I get, then I’ve got to go all out, with as little bodily movement as possible. That’s just the way I am.” “A lot of people want to play it safe by engaging in some kind of physical activity every now and then,” he continued. “Not me, though. I live for the rush.” The adventure-seeker told reporters that getting absolutely no aerobic exercise has been a part of his devil-may-care attitude for most of his life, adding that he has been “pressing [his] luck” with prolonged periods of idleness for as long as he can remember. Erickson explained that he continues to “roll the dice” in search of thrills on a daily basis, from his office job where he pushes himself to the limit by staring at the same screen for eight or more hours every day, to his domestic life, in which he ignores grave perils each night by sinking into his recliner with a box of Cheez-Its and remaining there virtually motionless long into the evening. According to Erickson, he must constantly raise the stakes on his daredevil behavior to achieve the same pleasurable sensations he used to feel. The local man told reporters that he is now kicking back with his legs up on his coffee table or lying in his backyard hammock for longer periods of time than ever before in search of a greater and greater high. “When I started out, I would take an occasional exhilarating midday nap, but I would always pull back from the edge by walking around the neighborhood or doing a little bit of yard work every so often. Now, though, that won’t cut it—I have to keep taking things to the next level,” said Erickson, noting that he is no longer content with spending merely four or five hours playing Xbox or watching only a portion of a daylong Breaking Bad marathon. “The thing is, sitting there for just the standard 8 p.m.-to-midnight block of primetime television just doesn’t carry the risk I need to get my adrenaline flowing anymore. Now, I’m pushing myself further than I’ve ever gone before, sometimes confining myself to the same spot on the couch for 16 hours at a time.” As he continues to push the envelope with his increasingly dangerous sedentary behavior, Erickson readily admitted that he is putting his well-being at risk, conceding that his pulse-pounding stationary lifestyle might end up seriously hurting him one day or even sending him to an early grave. “My girlfriend gets worried sick every time she sees me go out to the den with snacks in hand and then not come back for half a day or more,” said Erickson, adding that he is fully aware that he can only engage in the intoxicating thrill of spending an entire weekend watching multiple full seasons of a TV show on Netflix so many times before he winds up in the hospital. “And believe me, I realize that I’m walking a dangerous line every time I get my lunch order delivered straight to my cubicle or spend my entire Saturday lounging against my bed’s headboard reading back issues of Ultimate X-Men on my iPad. But taking these kinds of crazy risks is just part of who I am, and there’s no changing that.” “Maybe I’m putting my life in jeopardy living the way I do,” he continued. “But I want to spend what time I have on earth doing what I love.”"
Delicate Little Man Kept Awake All Night By Having Coffee After Four O’Clock,10/29/14,593,"GRAND RAPIDS, MI—Tossing and turning way past his beddy-bye, delicate little man Jeremy Palazola was reportedly unable to sleep Tuesday night because he drank a teensy bit of coffee after four o’clock. “I’ll have a cup in the morning sometimes, but that’s usually it,” said the precious flower, who tried and tried to keep his eyes closed but remained wide awake from the itty-bitty beverage he had 10 hours earlier. “I knew I shouldn’t have had any during the afternoon meeting, but I was just feeling so out of it.” At press time—oh no!—the darling little angel was getting a big tummy ache."
NYC Officials Assure Public Most Puddles Of Bodily Fluid On Streets Not Contaminated With Ebola,10/24/14,1033,"NEW YORK—Hoping to downplay fears of a potential Ebola outbreak in New York City, health officials assured residents Friday that most puddles of bodily fluid found on the streets are not contaminated with the deadly Ebola virus. “I want to emphasize that the pools of vomit, urine, and other fluids people may notice as they walk around the city are very unlikely to be contaminated with Ebola,” said New York City health commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett, adding that such fluids, as well as occasional clumps of feces, were almost certainly not deposited onto the streets and sidewalks by an infected individual. “While we are confident that these substances are free of Ebola specifically, contact with them may pose other health hazards, so we encourage all New Yorkers to continue stepping over them as always. There is no reason for anyone to change their normal routine.” Bassett went on to say that any individual who displayed the symptoms indicative of Ebola should immediately refrain from discharging bodily fluids in public."

Flu Clinic Selling 2009 Version Of Vaccine For A Few Bucks Cheaper,10/21/14,997,"OMAHA, NE—Saying that it probably still protects against a few strains of the virus going around this flu season, the immunization clinic at Nebraska Family Health Center is now offering doses of the 2009 influenza vaccine at a discounted price, sources confirmed Tuesday. “We had a bunch of the older stuff sitting around that we didn’t want to see go to waste, so we figured why not offer it for a few dollars cheaper,” said clinic nurse Jeanette Coleman, remarking that the older vaccines probably work “pretty well” when compared to those made for the 2014 season. “There are, of course, people who always like to get the latest version of whatever’s out there, but these five-year-old inoculations are a decent enough option if you’re looking to save a little money. To be honest, unless they see the date on the vial, most people can’t even tell the difference.” Coleman added that if a customer wants an even deeper discount, the clinic can administer the vaccine with a gently used needle."
Nurse Being Treated For Ebola Impressed With Health Workers’ New Gear,10/20/14,1084,"DALLAS—Admiring the personal protective equipment shielding her caregivers from the deadly virus, a nurse receiving treatment for Ebola told reporters Monday that she was very impressed with the medical workers’ newly issued biohazard gear. “Wow, I only had the flimsy gown that exposed several inches around my neck, but this guy’s decked out in a really nice full-body suit that covers everything,” said the infected nurse, who was particularly taken by the updated gear’s sealed hood, large apron, rubber boots, and second pair of surgical gloves, which are now recommended by the CDC for all hospital staffers treating patients exposed to the disease. “Sure, the surgical mask I had seemed great at the time, but the brand-new breathing pack and air filtration system my nurse was using really take the cake. It’s cool to be one of the first people to see this high-tech equipment.” The nurse confirmed she was most impressed with the new protocols for removing the biohazard gear, which reportedly involved more than tossing the protective clothing in the hospital’s laundry bin."

Hazmat Worker Sees No Reason To Throw Away All This Perfectly Good Food,10/17/14,826,"DALLAS—Claiming he would hate to see a carton of unspoiled milk and an entire loaf of bread go to waste, hazardous materials removal worker Jonathan Parker reportedly saw no reason Friday to throw away perfectly good food while disinfecting the apartment of an Ebola-stricken patient. “This pork roast can’t be more than a couple days old,” said Parker, lamenting the idea that a large hunk of parmesan cheese, fine-looking grapes, and a full head of cauliflower would be destroyed and deposited in a remote biohazard disposal site. “These eggs definitely look like they’re still pretty fresh. And that container of yogurt doesn’t expire for three more weeks—and it’s blueberry, too.” At press time, Parker was reportedly spotted carefully placing several grocery bags full of snacks and fresh produce in the trunk of his car."
Researchers: Quality Of Sleep May Be Affected By Abandoning Family In 1994,10/14/14,1277,"CHAMPAIGN, IL—According to a study published this week by researchers at the University of Illinois, an individual’s ability to get a good night’s sleep may be directly influenced by having made a decision 20 years ago to walk out on their family and never return. “In many cases, we found that chronic insomnia is strongly linked to reaching one’s breaking point on a winter evening back in 1994, waiting until everyone in the house was in bed, and then driving off into the night without looking back,” said study co-author Tim Liu, who noted a close correlation between erratic delta waves during stage 3 of the sleep cycle and not having spoken to your daughter since you tucked her in that night when she was 7. “Additionally, we saw that while nearly everyone who deserted their loved ones experienced some form of sleep loss, those who exhibited the most restless nights were the ones who told their new families they were off working on container ships 20 years ago instead of coming clean about the spouse and three children they left behind halfway across the country.” In a related finding, the researchers also concluded that individuals who carry on extramarital affairs with someone their spouse trusts sleep eight hours every night and always awake fully rested."
Genetics Emphatically Deny Playing Any Part In Area Man’s Body,10/13/14,1334,"TRUSSVILLE, AL—Attempting to distance themselves from the man’s outward appearance, the 46 chromosomes of local sales associate Peter Macon vociferously denied Monday that they had played a direct role of any kind in the present state of his physique. “Though it’s true we contributed a number of basic physical features early on, the condition of Peter’s body has long been out of our hands—this is completely on him,” said a strand of Macon’s DNA, explaining that, while it bore some responsibility for Macon’s overbite and male-pattern baldness, it could not be held accountable for the widening girth, sallow complexion, and double chin of a man whose every meal consists of either prepackaged, processed foodstuffs or an entire 16-inch delivery pizza. “We did our best to pass along traits that would predispose him toward healthy protein synthesis and muscle growth, but if Peter doesn’t get up from his recliner and exercise every now and then, there’s not much we can do to help him. We’re not the ones telling him to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack and sit there watching 15 hours of Hulu every weekend.” The genes later conceded that what Macon is doing to his body didn’t actually matter at this point, as they were planning to kill him off through a congenital heart defect within the next few years regardless."

Study: Majority Of Americans Not Prepared For A Sucker Punch To The Gut,10/07/14,4336,"WASHINGTON—Warning that millions of citizens across the country are currently at the highest level of risk, a study released Tuesday by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that the vast majority of Americans are not adequately prepared for a sucker punch to the gut. Agency officials determined that as much as three quarters of the American populace, or some 240 million individuals, are fully exposed and vulnerable to the threat of an acquaintance or fellow bar patron coming out of nowhere, placing one hand on their shoulder, and then drilling them square in the stomach with a closed fist. “According to our findings, the average American has not taken even the most basic precautions for the possibility that someone might wait until their guard is down and land a sudden, solid blow directly to their gut,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said, noting that citizens nationwide would likely be caught unaware and left completely devastated should a sucker punch hit in the near future. “Many people seem to believe that a sucker punch won’t happen to them, or that if it does, it won’t be particularly harmful. But the unfortunate reality is that a sucker punch can strike anyone at any time without warning, and it can be one of the most awful events of one’s life, often leaving victims doubled over and grimacing for minutes on end.” “That is why it’s absolutely crucial that citizens develop a comprehensive preparedness and recovery action plan immediately,” she continued. “Because by the time someone slugs you in the belly, it’s already too late.” Burwell stated that it was critical for citizens of all ages and backgrounds to understand the dangers of taking one right in the breadbasket, and noted that the agency was stepping up its efforts to provide information to citizens on how to protect themselves. First and foremost, Burwell said, citizens must stay informed about any person who might be poised to wing around and sock them in the first place. Additionally, she stressed that Americans should heed all credible warnings from anyone who threatens to whale on them, and instructed U.S. residents to make all efforts to get away from a potential jab to the abdomen or solar plexus before it can inflict any damage. However, should any American find him or herself in the unavoidable path of a sucker punch, according to Burwell, that person should make an effort to shield the vulnerable midsection by any means necessary, typically by clenching one’s abdominal muscles and gritting one’s teeth. Burwell stressed that citizens should then wait it out in place, advising individuals to hold their aching stomach and call the puncher a “fucking dick” until help arrives. “We want people to recognize that this is a problem that needs to be taken seriously. The last thing you should do is ignore the possibility of a sucker punch and turn your back on the situation,” Burwell said. “As that just leaves you exposed to a swift clock right to the back of the head.” While HHS officials called the study’s results “worrisome” and “disconcerting,” they noted that their findings were in line with other recent reports, including a 2011 survey that classified over half of Americans as “highly vulnerable” to being cold-cocked in the jaw and found that some 71 percent of citizens were entirely unprepared for a firm knee to the tailbone. Moreover, a FEMA study from last year reportedly found that as many as nine in 10 Americans had no plan in place should someone get down on all fours immediately behind them as a second individual pushed them backward. “We hope that through education, Americans can learn to recognize the risks posed by sucker punches and take the necessary safety measures to ensure they are sufficiently prepared should the unthinkable happen,” said Burwell, noting that for many Americans, it wasn’t a question of if they would be sucker punched, but when. “If you recognize a sucker punch early enough, there’s a good chance you can dodge the blow entirely and come back with a haymaker or a full nelson of your own.” “We will never be able to fully stop sucker punches from happening,” she continued. “But as long as everyone is properly prepared, it’s possible that, in the future, no American will be left sputtering and gasping on the floor in the fetal position.”"
CDC Attempts To Put Ebola Outbreak In Perspective By Releasing List Of Worse Ways To Die,10/06/14,1455,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to downplay fears of a potential Ebola outbreak in the United States, CDC officials aimed to put the disease in perspective Monday by releasing a list of worse ways to die than the infectious hemorrhagic virus. “It is understandable that individuals may be concerned by the presence of Ebola in the United States, but the general public should relax and recognize that there are quite a number of ways of dying that are, in fact, more terrible than succumbing to this disease; indeed, we were able to come up with several dozen,” said CDC director Thomas Frieden, adding that the 50-item list, which is currently available on the agency’s website, includes scenarios such as contracting leprosy and smallpox simultaneously, suffering dozens of infected bullet and stab wounds, and falling into an industrial-size wood chipper, climbing out part way, and then falling back in again. “While the public should continue to exercise a prudent level of caution, also remember that you could trip and land in a vat of caustic industrial solvent that slowly eats away at your body, or you could be sucked out of a jagged, shattered airplane window at 38,000 feet. We do not take your worries lightly, but know that there are, conceivably, more awful ways to go.” Frieden further attempted to assuage the American populace by reminding them that dying of Ebola in the United States was still a far better experience than dying of Ebola in Africa."
Single Nurse Can’t Help But Notice Man Isolated For Ebola Not Wearing A Ring,10/06/14,859,"DALLAS—Inferring that he might be “on the market,” Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse Monica Fitzgerald reportedly couldn’t help noticing Monday that Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, was not wearing a wedding ring. “He’s pretty cute, and unless my eyes deceive me, there doesn’t appear to be a Mrs. Duncan,” said Fitzgerald, 35, adding that she first observed the lack of a wedding band while inserting an intravenous tube into the critically ill man’s arm. “He seems to be the right age for me, and he definitely loves traveling as much as I do. I know it’s not a good idea to get involved with patients, but sometimes you just have to make an exception.” At press time, Fitzgerald was seen checking her hair and makeup before heading back into the isolation ward to assist with another blood transfusion."

Man Stuck In Dead-End Body,9/24/14,2262,"SAN MATEO, CA—Saying this was not at all how he had pictured himself at age 42, local resident Jonathan Cooper confirmed Wednesday that he has nonetheless found himself, in his middle age, stuck in a dead-end body. Cooper, who reportedly spent years trying to make the most of his physique, has gradually become more and more frustrated with his body, which he admitted had little chance of ever turning into anything he would be happy with. “I always thought I’d wind up with something better than this, but here I am,” said Cooper, who reported that his body has grown considerably more difficult to manage. “Early on, I thought, ‘This is okay for now.’ Back then, I used to have such high hopes, but the years just kept going by and it never got any better. When I take an honest look at what I have to deal with day in and day out, I just get depressed.” “Now, every morning when I wake up, I think, ‘Ugh, this again?’” he continued. “It’s not just disappointing; it’s humiliating, really.” Noting that his body leaves him feeling inferior, emasculated, and exhausted at the end of each day, Cooper said he could not even remember what it was he liked about it in the first place. Far from improving, Cooper explained that his body has gone steadily downhill and grown more dysfunctional with time, and admitted that, as the years pass, his likelihood of finding any redeeming aspects of his anatomy becomes more remote. Additionally, given his age, Cooper stated that he will probably have to remain in his current physical situation for the foreseeable future. “At this point, I think it’s too late to do anything about it, so the only thing I can really do is just accept it for what it is and go on with my life,” said Cooper, recognizing that while the world is full of people in circumstances far worse than his own, such knowledge was hardly any consolation. “The thing is, I remember seeing my father in this exact same situation when I was a kid and swearing that I would never let that happen to me. But of course I ended up just like him, and I’m every bit as miserable as he was.” “I guess the best I can do now is try not to screw it up any more than I already have,” Cooper added. “The last thing I’d want is for it to get any more unbearable.”"
Man Not Himself Until He Has So Much Coffee He Feels Like He’s Going To Die,9/16/14,1093,"VINELAND, NJ—Saying that he doesn’t function properly unless he’s completely jittery and suffering from nausea, local claims adjuster Spencer Howell told reporters Monday that he’s not his normal self until he has too many cups of coffee and feels like he could die at any second. “I’m totally useless in the morning before I’ve downed five or six cups of coffee, my forehead is drenched in sweat, and my internal organs feel like they are starting to disintegrate,” said Howell, adding that only when he’s consumed enough coffee so that his heart is pounding and at least one eyelid is twitching does he feel like he’s operating at 100 percent. “I don’t know how people who don’t consume an entire pot of coffee by themselves and begin suffering full-body tremors do it. I’m just not me until I’m plagued by painful acid reflux, excruciating headaches, and persistent concerns that I should call an ambulance immediately.” Howell also told reporters that he often has trouble socializing with his coworkers outside the office unless he drinks enough whiskey to black out for the entire night."
Daily Spin Class Only Thing Keeping Mom From Driving Car Full Of Kids Into Ocean,9/15/14,1228,"WALNUT CREEK, CA—Explaining that her workouts at Flywheel Sports always leave her feeling balanced and reenergized, local mother of three Karen Madison told reporters Monday that her daily spin class was the only thing keeping her from driving a car full of her children right into the Pacific Ocean. “I’m stuck in this house all day long, and I swear, if I don’t have my five o’clock spinning session, I will load the kids into the van and drive it straight off a dock,” said the 37-year-old, who added that just one hour of intense cardio with her instructor allows her to sweat away any stress that would cause her to speed her Honda through barriers along the waterfront and not stop until the vehicle was submerged under 10 feet of seawater. “I can be having the worst week, but once I’m in there spinning alongside [friends] Janet and Kathy, all my anxieties, and bad mood, and impulses to strap the boys into the backseat and plunge into a deep body of water just completely melt away. I don’t know what I’d do without those classes.” Madison added that the 30 minutes of yoga she performs each week in the family’s living room also provide her with the mental clarity she needs to not slowly poison her husband to death."
Night Of Uninterrupted Deep Sleep Really Throws Man’s Day Off,9/15/14,780,"HARRISBURG, PA—Feeling uncommonly alert and rested, local web designer Michael Schlesinger reported Monday that his entire workday had been thrown off after receiving eight hours of undisturbed sleep. “Man, I feel completely focused and full of energy—it’s really disorienting,” said Schlesinger, adding that he had to pause and regroup himself several times this morning as his active thinking and sharpened senses allowed him to work through several tasks with unfamiliar efficiency. “My body has felt totally rejuvenated and my mind’s been so clear since the moment I got up this morning. I just have to try to deal with it and make it through the day.” Schlesinger said he planned to drink several cups of coffee in hopes of getting back to his usual distracted and edgy self."
Doctor Has Troubling Amount Of Available Appointment Slots,9/09/14,1048,"SALINAS, CA—While scheduling a checkup at his primary care provider’s office, local resident Max Holden was reportedly left deeply unsettled Tuesday by the sheer number of available appointment slots on general practitioner Albert Corliss’ calendar. “I asked if I could see Dr. Corliss next week and the receptionist just flat out said, ‘Certainly, when can you come in?’” a visibly disconcerted Holden told reporters, confirming that his unease grew even more intense when he was offered his choice of a morning or afternoon appointment. “When I suggested either Thursday or Friday, she said, ‘Sure, which one?’ I was expecting some pushback, or maybe a list of one or two available openings, but she just left it wide open for me to name a time of day.

Lunch Barely Misses Area Man’s Vital Organs,9/03/14,936,"CHICAGO—In what doctors are calling nothing short of a miracle, local man Jared Fox narrowly averted catastrophe Wednesday when the bacon cheeseburger he ate for lunch managed to pass through his body without hitting any life-sustaining organs. “Mr. Fox is a lucky man—that burger went right past his heart and just barely missed his lungs,” said Dr. Karen Yang of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, noting that the meal entered Fox’s body mere inches from his brain and avoided his spinal cord by a matter of centimeters. “Based on its trajectory, the lunch appeared to be headed straight for his liver and kidneys, but fortunately, its track seems to have altered just enough for it to pass by without causing any damage.” Though there were no immediate life-threatening injuries, Yang said that remnants of the burger may stay lodged in the man’s abdomen for years to come and could present long-term health complications down the line."
Report: Standing At Work Can Increase Coworkers’ Disdain Up To 70%,8/15/14,1114,"GAINESVILLE, FL—According to a comprehensive 18-month study released Friday, researchers at the University of Florida have determined that standing for the duration of the workday can increase coworkers’ disdain by as much as 70 percent. “By simply switching from a traditional desk to a standing desk, we found that individuals experienced much longer and fuller looks of silent loathing from their colleagues,” said lead author Dr. Greg Darren, who confirmed that the more time subjects spent working on their feet, the greater the feelings of annoyance, scorn, and simmering contempt directed at them. “What’s most impressive is that the effects are apparent almost immediately—even just standing at one’s desk for a single afternoon resulted in a 25 percent increase in others’ feelings of derision. Over time, we found that this behavioral change can even lead to lifelong resentment in colleagues.” The study noted that in order to achieve the same level of disdain from standing at a desk, an individual would have to spend a full hour each day explaining his or her intensive workout regimen to colleagues."
FDA Recommends At Least 3 Servings Of Foods With Word ‘Fruit’ On Box,8/15/14,1007,"SILVER SPRING, MD—In an effort to get Americans to at least go through the motions of a healthier diet, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it is now recommending individuals consume three servings of foods every day that simply include the word “fruit” on the box. “Though we have in the past advised eating a minimum of three pieces of actual fruit per day, it is now acceptable to eat any food labeled with the word ‘fruit,’ including variations such as ‘fruity,’ ‘fruit-a-licious,’ or ‘fruit-blasted,’” FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg told reporters, also noting that sweetened cereal or gummies shaped like fruit are entirely permissible under the agency’s new guidelines. “If it smells somewhat like fruit, or even if there’s a cartoon strawberry or orange on the wrapper, that’s sufficient at this point.” The FDA’s new recommendations are expected to be followed up by other guidelines under which anything successfully chewed and swallowed can now be considered a vegetable."

Study Finds Blame Now Fastest Human Reflex,8/06/14,975,"WALTHAM, MA—According to a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, blame has now surpassed instinctive responses such as blinking and flinching as the fastest human reflex. “Our research shows that assigning fault to another person for a negative or unintended outcome is now the human body’s quickest involuntary action,” said lead author Dr. John Wittsack, adding that changes to the brain’s neural pathways over time have allowed for a nearly instantaneous transition between perceiving a problem and condemning someone else for causing it. “In the time it takes for a single sneeze or for the pupil to contract once, an average human can blame dozens, if not hundreds of individuals. In fact, the blame reflex may soon be too rapid to be measured even by our most sensitive instruments.” By contrast, Wittsack added that accepting responsibility had degenerated into a purely vestigial reflex and would eventually exit the human race altogether."
Michelle Obama Can Still Hear Their Little Labored Breaths When She Closes Her Eyes,8/04/14,864,"WASHINGTON—Saying that there must be hundreds, if not thousands of them panting and gasping, First Lady Michelle Obama told reporters Monday that she still hears the labored breaths of overweight schoolchildren whenever she closes her eyes. “The huffing and puffing—I just can’t escape it,” said a visibly distraught Obama, describing the disembodied chorus of tiny wheezing lungs that has haunted her every single day since the beginning of her husband’s presidency. “It starts off slow, but then it gets faster and faster, louder and louder. Each night brings the endless pitter-patter of them running flat-footed across the gymnasium floor and then struggling to catch their breath. Oh, God, I can even hear them now.” At press time, sources said President Obama was awoken from his sleep by a sweat-soaked First Lady hysterically begging him to make them stop."
GlaxoSmithKline Releases New Drug To Treat People Who Just Feel Sort Of Weird Sometimes,7/31/14,1224,"LONDON—In an effort to alleviate the vague, passing sensation of restlessness and unease that inexplicably afflicts thousands of people each day, pharmaceutical manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline released a new drug Wednesday specially formulated to treat the symptoms of individuals who just feel sort of weird sometimes. “This new medication will offer millions of people relief from feeling kind of ‘off’ for a reason they can’t quite explain,” GSK chief executive Andrew Witty said of the new drug, Placidex, which reportedly provides relief to individuals who every so often wake up with a sense of being a little out of it, a common malady that, according to pharmacologists, can last anywhere from just a few minutes to an entire afternoon. “One daily tablet will help alleviate the uncomfortable feeling people sometimes get when everything seems just a little bit out of sync. You know, when you’re not quite tired, exactly, but you definitely don’t feel 100 percent alert, and everything’s just kind of…disconnected, I guess? You know what I’m talking about, right?” According to industry sources, Placidex will be followed up by a new drug for individuals who are perfectly happy and are enjoying normal, healthy lives."
New Study Finds Running For 20 Minutes Each Day Could Add Years Of Soreness To Life,7/31/14,1243,"EAST LANSING, MI—According to a study released Wednesday by doctors at Michigan State University, running for 20 minutes every day was found to be effective in adding several years of soreness to people’s lives. “We found that individuals do not need to exercise very much on a daily basis to increase the number of years they live in dull, aching pain,” lead author Dr. Justin Gallo said of the study, which found that for every 10 minutes spent running per day, subjects could expect to gain an additional year of stiffness and discomfort in their calves, glutes, and thighs. “Even subjects who jog just five to 10 minutes a day are likely to see an appreciable increase in the amount of time they live with radiating hip pain and throbbing in their knees. The real takeaway from our research is that just getting off the couch once a day may be enough to give you one or two more years of clutching at your lower back and wincing.” The study further noted that individuals who engage in strenuous runs of five miles or more every day of the week, regardless of temperature and weather conditions, were able to add, on average, an additional decade of being actively despised by acquaintances, coworkers, and casual onlookers to their lives."
Experts: Ebola Vaccine At Least 50 White People Away,7/30/14,1065,"CONAKRY, GUINEA—With the death toll in West Africa continuing to rise amid a new outbreak of the Ebola virus, leading medical experts announced Wednesday that a vaccine for the deadly disease is still at least 50 white people from being developed. “While all measures are being taken to contain the spread of the contagion, an effective, safe, and reliable Ebola inoculation unfortunately remains roughly 50 to 60 white people away, if not more,” said Tulane University pathologist Gregory Wensmann, adding that while progress has been made over the course of the last two or three white people, a potential Ebola vaccination is still many more white people off. “We are confident, however, that with each passing white person, we’re moving closer to an eventual antigenic that will prevent and possibly even eradicate the disease.” Wensmann said he remained optimistic that the vaccine would not take considerably longer than his prediction, as waiting more than 50 white people for an effective preventative measure was something the world would simply not allow."
Patient Zero Kicking Back In 38C With Episode Of ‘New Girl’,7/30/14,753,"ATLANTA—Reclining his seat and switching on his iPad as his plane reached cruising altitude Wednesday, United Airlines passenger and Patient Zero of a highly infectious disease, Chris McCann, reportedly kicked back in seat 38C on his flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City with a few episodes of the Fox sitcom New Girl. “I’ll take a ginger ale,” said the first human in existence to contract the lethal strain of the airborne virus, before reaching across his seatmate, taking his beverage from the flight attendant, and settling back into the show. “And you don’t have a blanket, do you? That’d be great when you get a chance.” At press time, the source of the deadly contagion was working his way down the full length of the aisle toward the restroom."

FDA Approves First Artificial Tumor,7/29/14,1298,"WASHINGTON—Following years of research and testing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration officially approved a groundbreaking artificial tumor Tuesday, marking the first time a synthetic malignant growth has been cleared for use in patients across the country. “There were obviously significant complications in devising a tumor substitute the human body would accept, but we now have an artificial neoplasm that serves the same physiological functions as an organic abnormal growth of tissue,” said Jeffrey Shuren of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, adding that the polymer-based lump can be safely implanted in patients regardless of age, health, or medical history during a minimally invasive and relatively quick two-hour surgical procedure. “This synthetic tumor is remarkably lightweight, malignant, and capable of naturally metastasizing throughout the body. It also has the benefit of being incredibly small—roughly the size of a dime—but once in the body, it will grow two to three times in size and will get to work immediately replicating itself.” Shuren added that while initial prototypes of the device had only enough battery power to last a few days, the approved version is capable of going for several years or more, or until its objective has been completed."
Doctors Say Average Heart Attack Victim Doesn’t Clutch At Chest Nearly Dramatically Enough,7/24/14,1263,"DALLAS—According to the results of a study published Thursday by the American Heart Association, most heart attack victims do not freeze up and grab at their chests with sufficient measures of theatrics when suffering a cardiac arrest. “After analyzing data from the past 30 years, we found that when someone experiences heart failure, the most common reaction is fairly mundane; there’s unfortunately no stumbling around the room or frantic straining to enunciate the words ‘having…heart…attack.’ Typically, the person merely winces and slumps over in place until paramedics arrive,” said AHA spokesman Dr. Phillip Trainor, who also noted with disappointment that it is extremely rare for victims seated at dinner tables or restaurants to gasp loudly before falling face-first into a plate of food. “As few as one in 10 victims even rigidly extend one arm out in front of them, much less reach out for support and accidentally knock several books and framed photos from a shelf or mantle before falling to the ground themselves.” Trainor went on to compare heart attack sufferers to electrocution victims, stating that in most cases, such individuals do not levitate with their limbs fully splayed and their skeletons visible to onlookers for nearly long enough."
Man Failing To Heed Harsh Lessons Of Past Orders Sonic Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster,7/10/14,762,"BARTLETT, IL—Turning his back on the opportunity to learn from countless erstwhile mistakes, 29-year-old resident Jason Connolly reportedly failed to heed the many harsh lessons of the past Thursday and instead opted to order a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster from a local Sonic restaurant. “I’ll have the Toaster with extra BBQ sauce, please,” Connolly said in a blatant disregard of history’s cruel but obvious truths, thereby dooming himself to repeat the seemingly endless cycle of misery and pain. “Actually, let’s make that a combo. With a Coke.

Elderly Man Can’t Wait For Senility To Erase Lifetime Of Regretful Memories,7/08/14,1188,"CLEARWATER, FL—Having in recent years noticed the gradual decline in his mental function, local retiree James Latham, 83, told reporters Tuesday that he is eagerly waiting for his encroaching senility to erase a lifetime’s worth of bitter memories. “I’ve got regrets I’ve been dwelling on every single day for 50, 60, even 70 years, so it’s going to be really nice when dementia finally runs that stuff out the door once and for all,” Latham said, expressing hope that the impending deterioration of the brain structures responsible for memory would spare him from contemplating the unrequited loves, unfulfilled aspirations, and dissolved friendships that have haunted him decade after decade. “I can already barely remember the details of my numerous unsuccessful businesses, and the other day, I completely forgot why it is that my son refuses to speak to me. Why, even now, I can’t come up with the name of that pretty girl in my old apartment building who I never worked up the courage to talk to—yeah, this is going to be fantastic.” At press time, Latham was sitting nude on a park bench, soiling himself as he vividly recalled every agonizing detail of his second failed marriage."
New Pfizer Breakthrough Miraculously Extends Lifespan Of Near-Death Patents,6/27/14,1090,"NEW YORK—Hailing it as a groundbreaking discovery with far-ranging benefits, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a new breakthrough Friday that vastly extends the lifespan of near-death patents. “Ensuring that every one of these patents lives a long and fruitful life is our highest priority, and we’re committed to doing everything in our power to make sure they survive,” said Pfizer spokeswoman Ellen Hilty, noting that the drug manufacturer with more than $50 billion in annual revenues had assembled elite teams of experts and dedicated years of intense work to finding a way to prolong the lives of dying patents. “At Pfizer, patents always come first. Our primary goal is, and always will be, keeping them alive and healthy for as long as possible. And that’s why we couldn’t be happier to announce this wonderful development.” Hilty added that nothing causes Pfizer officials more distress than seeing a once robust patent expire at a young age, a “terrible tragedy” that allows dozens of generic manufacturers to copy it and offer pharmaceuticals to customers far more cheaply."

"3 Dozen Chemical, Emotional Responses Activated By Phrase ‘Pigs In A Blanket’",6/17/14,1182,"FLIPPIN, AR—Triggering a range of emotional responses that had lain dormant in his psyche for decades, approximately 35 different chemical processes were reportedly activated in the brain of local man Rob Northcutt upon hearing the phrase “pigs in a blanket” Tuesday. According to accounts, within nanoseconds of recognizing the words and calling to mind the dough-wrapped cocktail wieners, the man’s limbic system simultaneously summoned feelings of hunger, joy, envy, desire, and even, somehow, a deep sense of loss. Additionally, the flood of neurotransmitters and flurry of synaptic activity, which reportedly spanned four areas of Northcutt’s temporal lobe, is said to have conjured up a diverse mixture of tastes, smells, sounds, and memories, including that of late-summer sunlight, the sharp aroma of dijon mustard, the pattern on the dishware at his grandparents’ old house, and the chorus of the song “Where Do You Go” by No Mercy, which was playing at a family wedding in 1997 where pigs in a blanket were served. At press time, Northcutt heard the words “German potato salad,” sparking not a single chemical or emotional response and leaving him feeling completely numb."
"Warm Weather Finally Allows Man To Get Outside, Explore New Ways To Sweat",6/12/14,1057,"CHICAGO—With the long winter over and summer weather finally arriving, local man Bill Klocek told reporters Thursday that he was glad to finally get out of the house, walk around a bit, and discover entirely new ways to sweat. “This time of year, there are so many street fairs, farmers markets, and music festivals that offer great opportunities to just drench myself in my own sweat,” said Klocek, who added that he especially looks forward to perspiring heavily at restaurants with outdoor seating, on road trips, at baseball games, and at his parents’ cabin in Lake Geneva, WI. “There’s really no excuse for avoiding it. Practically all you have to do is step out your front door and you can sweat completely through your shirt. My friend is having a party on his roof deck tonight, so I’m thinking about heading over and feeling sweat drip down my face and back at his place a little later.” In addition to getting sweaty, Klocek stated that he also plans to set aside a little time this summer to explore entirely new ways to get sunburnt and thirsty."
New Study Finds People Who Sit For At Least 5 Hours Each Day Are Comfier,6/09/14,1026,"BATON ROUGE, LA—A study released Monday by physicians at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center has concluded that people who spend five or more hours per day sitting are significantly more likely to be comfy than those who do not. “Our clinical trials indicate that individuals whose lifestyles involve sitting for less than two hours a day experience far less comfiness than those who sit for longer periods,” said the study’s head researcher Dr. Stan McGuinness, adding that seated individuals are up to 20 times as likely to be comfy as their standing counterparts. “They enjoy a greater number of comfy sensations in their lower torso and leg regions, whereas people who stand for extended periods often develop symptoms such as achy muscles and uncomfy feet. Interestingly, the comfiest people of all are those who sit for most of the day and then spend eight hours or more lying down.” McGuinness went on to state that in addition to being comfy, those lying down tend to be far cozier and, in many cases, snugglier."

Study Links Drinking While Pregnant To Being At Kid Rock Concert,6/04/14,1081,"ROCHESTER, MN—A comprehensive five-year study conducted by researchers at the Mayo Clinic has identified a strong link between heavy drinking during pregnancy and attending a public performance by Detroit-based rap-rocker Kid Rock, officials confirmed Wednesday. “Our survey found that expectant mothers who consumed hard liquor were far more likely to be at a Kid Rock concert than a control group who did not drink,” said Dr. Lawrence Talmage, whose research also indicated that 78.3 percent of women who drank to intoxication while pregnant were wearing shredded T-shirts and riding atop the presumed father’s shoulders during encores of “All Summer Long” and “Bawitdaba.” “Across all three trimesters, drinking three or more alcoholic beverages in less than an hour was highly correlated with going backstage at a Kid Rock show and then getting into a fistfight with another woman in the parking lot.” The study also suggested that combining recreational drug use with drinking during pregnancy made women twice as likely to scream “Sign my titty!” outside the band’s tour bus."
"Deep Down, Area Man Knows He’s Not Done Vomiting",6/03/14,839,"NEW YORK—Speaking to reporters while crouched on the floor of his bathroom, local man Brandon Parker confirmed Tuesday that, deep down inside, he knows he has not yet finished vomiting. “I want to believe that I can get up right now and go lie down in bed, but If I’m being honest with myself, I have to admit I’m not done here yet,” said the pallid, perspiring 26-year-old, hovering over the rim of his toilet and acknowledging that, in his heart of hearts, he is fully aware he should stay right where he is. “I just don’t think I could look myself in the eye right now and say, ‘Well, that’s over with. I’m good to go.’ No, this is where I should be.” After several more minutes of silent contemplation, sources reported that Parker convinced himself that he had, in fact, finished vomiting, a position he later reversed in the hallway."
American Medical Association Introduces New Highly Effective Placebo Doctors,5/29/14,1757,"CHICAGO—Saying that clinical trials have confirmed such individuals provide comparable results to fully trained, professional physicians, the American Medical Association announced Thursday the introduction of new placebo doctors to administer general practice medical care to the American public. “Making sure patients are seen promptly at local doctors’ offices and clinics is one of the AMA’s top priorities, and by simply supplementing the nation’s existing pool of primary care providers with several thousand unlicensed individuals whose appearance and behavior are indistinguishable from those of real doctors, we can greatly expand the medical community’s ability to address patients’ most commonplace ailments,” said AMA spokeswoman Tara Cosgrove, noting that allergies, aches, and the common cold were treated “just as effectively” by regular people who convincingly walked into an examination room looking down at a chart; appeared to check a patient’s eyes, throat, and blood pressure; then told the patient that the symptoms were nothing too severe and should clear up within a week. “Patients will be unable to tell if they received medical care from an experienced, board-certified doctor or someone who is just wearing a white coat and stethoscope and speaks to them for a couple minutes about whatever is troubling them while jotting down nonsense on a form, and in most general practice situations, we can assure the patient that his or her condition will be eliminated regardless of which individual they meet.” Cosgrove added that while the new placebo primary care physicians have generally been found to correspond with positive outcomes, the AMA had yet to achieve an equivalent success rate among its pilot group of placebo surgeons."
Study: Average American Now Requires 3 Attempts To Get Up From Seated Position,5/19/14,1043,"BETHESDA, MD—A study published Monday by the National Institutes of Health found that the typical American now requires three distinct attempts to raise themselves from a seated position. “Between shifting in a chair, placing both hands on the chair’s armrests and heaving themselves up, or simply tilting their bodies forward and using momentum, Americans have to perform an average of three unique movements before they are able to rise to a standing position,” said NIH lead researcher Helen Glaser of the study that observed thousands of U.S. citizens attempting to get up from couches, recliners, park benches, car passenger seats, movie theater seats, and restaurant booths, adding that most Americans also required 60 to 90 seconds to recover between exertions. “While some Americans were able to get to their feet in just two stages, others simply abandoned their efforts to stand altogether and remained seated indefinitely.” The report also found that once standing, Americans could resume a seated position in a single fluid motion."
American Medical Association Changes Stance On Self-Immolation,5/16/14,1156,"NEW YORK—In a stunning announcement that has sent shockwaves throughout the field of public health, the American Medical Association officially changed its long-held stance on self-immolation Friday, reversing decades of support for the ritualistic practice of lighting oneself on fire. “After careful reevaluation and extensive discussion within the medical community, we have found it necessary to cease advocating for individuals to douse themselves in kerosene or other flammable chemicals, go out into the middle of a public square, and set their bodies aflame,” said AMA spokesperson Arnold Krbecek, who confirmed that an official bulletin had been sent to all 220,000 AMA-member physicians alerting them that the practice of self-immolation had been associated with adverse health outcomes and could prove lethal in extreme cases. “Immolating oneself remains a patient’s choice, but it is only one in an array of options that we encourage them to discuss with their doctor. The AMA will simply no longer be requiring that physicians prescribe it to their patients.” Krbecek also confirmed the organization’s view on hepatitis was still under review."

American Obesity Epidemic Traced To Single Heavyset ‘Mayflower’ Passenger,3/27/14,5074,"BOSTON—In a startling discovery that sheds new light on the link between the earliest American colonists and their modern descendants, researchers at Boston University announced Thursday they have traced the U.S. obesity epidemic back to a single heavyset Mayflower passenger. Through an exhaustive analysis of genetic samples, as well as diary entries, ship logs, and tattered medical records from the early 17th century, a multidisciplinary research team has reportedly determined that the majority of severely overweight individuals in the United States today share key genetic markers and unhealthy eating behaviors that appear to be passed down from a 307-pound Plymouth Colony settler named Jeremiah Alden. “At a time when the average European male weighed perhaps 135 pounds, Jeremiah’s tremendous size was an exceedingly rare trait, which is indicated by contemporary accounts of him as a ‘startling behemoth’ and ‘wide-across as three men together,’” biologist Allan Fortner said of the man who, by fathering nine portly children, is believed to have introduced a predisposition toward slow metabolism and sedentary personal habits into the American genome. “After carefully sequencing the DNA of his remains, we have pinpointed this hefty Pilgrim’s appearance in the New World as the single most crucial event giving rise to modern Americans’ elevated BMIs, tendency toward overeating, and aversion to exercise.” “We would certainly not have a situation in which 62 percent of the U.S. population is either overweight or obese had this man simply stayed in England,” he added. Noting that early American colonies were frequently plagued by starvation, researchers said Alden’s sheer caloric intake—a 17th-century journal claimed he “consum’d three-and-twenty biscuits every noonday”—allowed the separatist Puritan to thrive despite the odds, resulting in a selective genetic advantage. The study’s authors also confirmed that the United States’ high rates of Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, knee joint pain, and sleep apnea are almost solely a result of this one enormous man’s contributions to the gene pool. Researchers said they were first inspired to study Alden after reading several passages in William Bradford’s Of Plymouth Plantation, which described the settler as a “slothfull fellow who erupteth through his waistcoat with girth” and “labours hard for his breath, the swett allways upon his crimson-hued face.” Though he counted for only one of the Mayflower’s 102 passengers, logs kept during the voyage claimed he had “near devowered rations set a-side for one man’s intire voyage” before the ship had even left port in England, enraging his gaunt and scurvy-prone fellow travelers. “Upon their arrival in the New World, the Pilgrims quickly got to work laying the foundation for a new civilization, but it appears Jeremiah just sort of hung out on board for a few days, nibbling on salt pork,” historian Karen Harmon said. “And once he disembarked, he made quick work of the colony’s stores of grain and dried provisions, leading to around half the settlers dying in that first winter.” Citing records that indicate Alden required “the skines of seven otters to cloathe wholy his great bodily expance,” the research team suggested that his excess reserves of adipose tissue allowed him—and the genes he would pass along—to survive until spring. Numerous artifacts provide further evidence of Alden’s rotundness, including a contemporary woodcut that depicts a nearly spherical man, the buckles on his doublet straining to contain his frame as he stands among a group of rail-thin Pilgrims and Native Americans. Additional documents also describe first Thanksgiving in 1621, at which, according to one account, this ancestral forerunner of U.S. obesity “did go back for double, treble, and quadreble servings” of wildfowl and maize. “Mr. Alden hath the breadth of many men & eats as such, w’out nary a mite of shame, his wide, flesh-ly hands etern’ly imparting morsels unto his happy mouth,” reads an entry from the diary of Mayflower captain Christopher Jones. “The savages cry at his immense appearance, be-lieving they that he is some terrible monster.” “This morn we went to gather straw fit for thatch and return’d to finde Jeremiah eating merrilee of our common victuals, which did anger us plenty,” it continues. “Yet he merely shrugged & smiled in a bashfull way, in accordance with his gener’ly joyous & agreeible comportment.” The researchers stressed, however, that their discovery of a single obese progenitor should not be used as a scapegoat by modern Americans for their poor dietary habits and dangerously high body masses. “While this is a significant discovery, we must not blame Jeremiah Alden alone for today’s pervasive obesity problem,” Fortner said. “He certainly set our nation on the wrong path in terms of excessive weight and unhealthy food choices, but we must all take responsibility for our own health. Otherwise we might end up just like Jeremiah, who died of a heart attack at age 46 after being accused of witchcraft.”"
It Not Clear If It Okay To Pass Handicapped Woman On Sidewalk,3/10/14,921,"BOSTON—After nearly a minute of being stuck behind a slow-moving disabled woman on the sidewalk Monday, it reportedly remained unclear to 32-year-old sales manager Alex Tremont whether it would be acceptable for him to pass her or not. “Jeez, what exactly am I supposed to do here?” Tremont reportedly said to himself, mentally noting that if he briskly slipped by the slow-moving woman he might make her self-conscious of her impairment, and that if he bumped into her while trying to squeeze past he would feel “just terrible.” “I suppose I could cross the street, get a block or so ahead, and then cross back, but how offensive would that be if she notices me doing it? Boy, maybe the best option is just to wait this out.” After several more moments of intense thought, Tremont reportedly settled on the option of walking around the woman but giving her a warm, courteous nod to acknowledge her presence as he passed."
"Study Links Meat, Sugar Consumption To Early Death Among Those Who Choose To Be Happy In Life",3/05/14,1302,"WASHINGTON—According to a study published Wednesday in the Journal Of The American Medical Association, researchers have discovered a strong correlation between regular meat and sugar consumption and premature death among those who choose to lead happy and fulfilling lives. “Our data indicate that people who eat large amounts of red meat and saccharides have, on average, markedly shorter and more satisfying life spans,” said the study’s lead author, Aubrey Schrader, adding that frequent ingestion of animal protein, chocolate, and sweetened snacks and beverages lowered the average age of onset of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer for those who take pleasure in their daily existence. “Evidence from our study suggests that diets rich in prime rib, pulled pork, strawberry cheesecake, flank steak, and Snickers bars were directly related to younger ages at death among men and women who embraced their life and made the absolute most of their time on earth. Moreover, these individuals appeared to exhibit a greater peace in dying, able to pass on without any regrets in their lives whatsoever.” The study also revealed that the loved ones of those who passed away prematurely and contented were typically far better suited to handle their grief due to their high levels of alcohol consumption."
Cancer Diagnosed With Skip Bayless,2/25/14,3277,"‘It’s Stage IV Skip Bayless, The Loudest, Most Aggressive Kind,’ Say Doctors NEW YORK—Saying that nobody deserves to endure such an atrocious fate, doctors at Mount Sinai Medical Center announced at a press conference Tuesday that they had diagnosed cancer with stage IV Skip Bayless. Surgical oncologist Dr. Andrew Bergman confirmed that Skip Bayless, one of the most dreaded and abhorrent diseases known to mankind, had metastasized, spreading throughout the malignant neoplasm and causing excruciating pain in the cancerous tissue. “Realistically, cancer has little hope for survival with Skip Bayless this bad,” said Bergman, predicting that cancer will suffer severe agony brought on by the vociferous affliction that cuts off anyone in its path. “Based upon my professional experience, I’d say Skip Bayless is just about the worst thing you could have to deal with.” “I wouldn’t wish Skip Bayless on my worst enemy,” Bergman solemnly continued. According to Bergman’s prognosis, cancer will likely experience fatigue and nausea from Skip Bayless aggressively and rapidly spreading its inane remarks, noting that patients typically report severe shortness of breath as they become more exasperated with the cantankerous growth’s refusal to see logic. Bergman told reporters that the cancer would continue to waste away, shriveling to a shell of its former self, until it eventually shuts down completely in reaction to the overwhelming smugness of Skip Bayless. The oncologist confirmed that most Skip Bayless victims usually contract the despicable ailment within the first 15 minutes of televised segments. “Unfortunately right now there is no cure for Skip Bayless,” said Bergman, adding that while early detection offers some hope for treatment, at this stage nearly 95 percent of patients will lose their battle with the self-satisfied disease. “It resists nearly everything we throw at it. It just continues to attack relentlessly without listening to a single thing. It pains me to say that fighting it is a completely futile effort.”  “All we can do now is make the cancer as comfortable as possible and allow Skip Bayless to run its course,” Bergman continued. According to Bergman, regular screenings for Skip Bayless are imperative, both through medical scans as well as routine self-checks at home. Bergman said that early warning signs of the highly virulent commentator include persistent headaches, loss of appetite, and abnormal bumps in ratings. Bergman also stressed the importance of preventative care, stating that the incidence of Skip Bayless skyrockets amongst those who begin discussing the value of NBA power forward Kevin Durant or anyone who leaves ESPN on from 10 a.m. until noon. “It tests your faith, even as a doctor, to see cancer saddled with something horrible like Skip Bayless,” said Bergman, reflecting on the anguish of those who must watch cancer struggle in vain as it attempts to cling to life, knowing they can do nothing to help. “People are always looking for a reason. They find themselves wondering how God could allow such a vicious thing like Skip Bayless to exist in this world.” “All we can say is that Skip Bayless is something we wish modern medicine could have eradicated from society years ago,” added the oncologist."

Real-Life Nancy Drew Traces Source Of Her HPV,2/18/14,839,"CHARLOTTE, NC—Cleverly putting together the clues to crack the case Monday, Samantha Pearson—a real-life Nancy Drew—reportedly used her sleuthing skills to deduce who had infected her with genital human papillomavirus. “I knew it had to be someone I’d met at the big party last month, but who could it be?” said Pearson, 20, who explained that she stumbled on the mystery after discovering several curious-looking warts on her skin. “Then all of a sudden I realized: HPV doesn’t usually spread from mouth to mouth, but by hands and genitalia! So it couldn’t be Fred or Danny, and since Mr. Conway just likes to watch, I quickly worked out that the culprit must be Kyle O’Keefe—of course!” At press time, sources confirmed the perky young gumshoe was off to track down the sinister fellow responsible and key an obscenity into his car door."
Manic Researchers Announce They Are Hours Away From Cure For Depression,2/14/14,5109,"BLOOMINGTON, IN—Speaking loudly and quickly without any notable pauses, a team of manic researchers at Indiana University announced at a press conference Wednesday that they are mere hours away from a permanent cure for depression. The wide-eyed, unblinking scientists, who paced back and forth along the podium while nodding their heads vigorously, told the assembled press corps that after they rounded up several hundred test subjects and carried out multiple clinical trials, they expected to have a fully effective treatment for the mood disorder ready by this evening. “Depression is a serious and complex mental illness, but there’s no reason we can’t solve it tonight—there’s nothing holding us back,” said head researcher Dr. Gavin Rowe, trembling euphorically as he mentioned that he felt “unstoppable” and had been working on the problem for the past 49 hours straight. “We’ll just run a few experiments in the next half hour, develop a medication, nail down some dosages, and get rid of depression once and for all. That’s it. Christ, we’re finally thinking clearly!” Punctuating their statements with broad, forceful gestures, the scientists explained that they were now making “15 or 20 medical breakthroughs a minute” and had written more than 350 pages of an academic paper during the morning that they intended to submit for publication immediately. Moreover, the researchers vowed to conduct a randomized double-blind study right then and there on stage, noting multiple times under their breath that “it’s all so simple.” “This research is basically doing itself—it’s not even hard,” said neurologist Deborah Franks, emitting an abrupt and ebullient peal of laughter before quickly returning to her explanation of how the research team was on the brink of eradicating an illness that has stymied medical science for centuries. “Sure, identifying the neural underpinnings of a major mental disorder is a bit of a challenge, but at the rate we’re flying through this research, that’s nothing, nothing at all. That’ll take five minutes.” “By this time tomorrow, clinical depression will be completely gone,” Franks continued. “Atypical depression, postpartum depression, seasonal depression—we’ll cure all of those. My God, we’re so close! We’re on fire and nothing can ever stop us!” Several times throughout the press conference, sources confirmed that the manic scientists alternately shouted at the press corps to get out of the room to let them think, and then directly challenged the reporters to “name any disease,” asserting that they would cure it on the spot. The ecstatic researchers, who confirmed that their minds are working better and faster than they ever have before, estimated that as soon as they wrapped up their clinical analysis this afternoon, they would immediately receive congratulatory phone calls from the National Institutes of Health, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, every major pharmaceutical company, the U.S. surgeon general, and the Nobel Prize committee. “We’re on the verge of the greatest achievement in the history of medicine!” said Dr. Alejo Myron during a fast-paced 18-minute uninterrupted speech that included several dozen emphatic slaps of his open palm against the lectern. “Everything’s finally coming together: problem—solution. Hypothesis—data. Trial—outcome. It’s just like dominoes. We’re knocking all these tasks down one after another like dominoes, just knocking it all down, knocking it all down, knocking it all down!” The team of researchers, repeatedly pausing to scribble down ideas on notepads and mop beads of sweat from their brows, assured reporters they did not need to sleep and would immediately turn their attention to shepherding the product through FDA safety evaluations, vowing to bring the drug to market and personally administer it to every American with a depression diagnosis by the end of the week. Gesturing toward a chalkboard full of illegible calculations and sketches, the team then told reporters that they were “invincible scientific juggernauts” who could “never fail, ever.” “We’re going to raise so much money for this cure. We’re going to raise tons of money! When everyone sees what we’re on to, they’ll want to give us thousands—no, billions of dollars,” geneticist Keith Dunbar said in a near shout, while holding his quivering balled-up fists at chest-level. “Of course they will. We’re moments away from eliminating depression forever! We’ll probably even have time to make some headway on that schizophrenia MRI study that’s been sitting on the back burner. Oh, and plus the literature review I’ve been meaning to do—I can fire that off in an hour. Then there’s Deborah’s chimp experiment, and I can write up that bilateral lesion study from September!” “Actually, you know what? I’m going to go do that now,” he added before briskly striding off the podium. As of press time, however, each of the scientists had reportedly slumped to the ground in tears, saying all the research they had ever done was “completely worthless” and admitting that clinical depression is likely impossible to cure."
Report: Seasonal Depression Still Better Than Purchasing Tiny Sunshine Lamp,2/11/14,1139,"WASHINGTON—According to a new report published Monday by the National Institutes of Health, the mental duress of seasonal affective disorder is still substantially preferable to actually going out and buying a little indoor sunshine lamp. “In controlled studies, the embarrassment of flagging down a Brookstone clerk and uttering the words ‘I’d like a Nature Bright lamp’ far outweighed the emotional toll of wintertime blues, even before factoring in the awkwardness of repeatedly having to explain the glaring rectangle to houseguests,” read the report, which also found that experiencing brief periods of seasonal depression pales in comparison to the onerous task of dragging a desk lamp from room to room six months out of the year. “In fact, a majority of people said they’d gladly take some extra anxiety or sleep problems if it meant never having to convince themselves that $100 for a bunch of multicolored LED lights was a good investment.” The report concluded by reminding all sufferers of seasonal depression that while they might feel sad sometimes, at least they don’t have to pretend Sky Effect™ technology is a real thing."

"Man Getting Screwed By Company’s $180,000 Health Deductible",1/29/14,955,"BOULDER, CO—Noting that his out-of-pocket costs seemed a little high, recently hired marketing assistant Jerry Aarons, 32, told sources Tuesday that he is beginning to suspect he’s getting screwed over by his health plan’s $180,000 deductible. “At my last job my annual deductible was only around $900 for the same coverage, so this seems a little off the mark,” said Aarons, recalling how the plan had looked like a good deal on paper because once he pays the $180,000, he’d only be responsible for 60 percent of the subsequent costs plus no co-pay for preventative care. “After signing up, I did some rough estimates and I was like, ‘Oh man, I have to go to the doctor 400 times and have 26 elective surgeries before this becomes worth it.’ You know, I bet this plan is probably meant for an older person whose health isn’t as great.” At press time, Aarons was also starting to question the value of having a 401(k) that can’t be touched until he’s 130."
Doctor Quickly Scribbles Prescription That Will Lead To 30-Year Battle With Painkiller Addiction,1/28/14,898,"TAMPA, FL—After a brief consultation with new patient Dan Highland, local primary care physician Dr. Harold Schlesinger quickly scribbled down a prescription that will touch off a self-destructive 30-year battle with painkiller addiction, sources confirmed Tuesday. “I gave you a few refills in case the pain lingers,” said Schlesinger, casually handing over a slip of paper that effectively set in motion three decades of compulsive abuse of opioids, a torturous cycle of detox and relapse, and a dark, drawn-out period of pain and anguish that will not only consume Highland, but his family members and friends as well. “Let me know if this dosage isn’t strong enough, and I’ll either bump you up or we’ll get you on something new.” Schlesinger quickly added that while it’s recommended that patients not drink alcohol while on the prescription, in practice Highland should “just use moderation.”"
Surgeon General Advises Being 19 Years Old With 100 Bucks In Your Pocket And Your Whole Life In Front Of You,1/28/14,4808,"WASHINGTON—Delivering his weekly address to members of the press Tuesday, acting U.S. Surgeon General Boris Lushniak advised all Americans to be 19 years old with $100 in their wallets and the rest of their lives still ahead of them. Lushniak, the nation’s leading public health official, strenuously urged all American adults, regardless of age, race, or income, to be young and in the prime of their life. In addition to having a strong, youthful body and a boundless spirit of spontaneity, the surgeon general stressed that being 19 was exactly what U.S. citizens needed to feel free—truly free—from their responsibilities and to instill in them the confidence that they could do anything they wanted in this world. “Based on our findings, it is the recommendation of the Office of the Surgeon General that each and every American be in their late teens, without a care in their mind, and with just enough money to get by for the next few days, because when you’re 19 the next few days are all that matter,” said Lushniak, stressing the importance of being old enough to do whatever you want but not old enough to give a damn about the consequences. “We found that every single American would greatly benefit from not having a 9-to-5 keeping them busy or a family at home—just a minimum-wage job they can ditch whenever they want to visit a buddy down in the city or go swimming in the quarry on a nice summer day.” “We predict that most Americans would enjoy a sharp improvement in their quality of life if they were 19,” Lushniak added. “Especially if they could still hit up their folks for some dough every so often and if they had a decent place with a few cool roommates that wasn’t much, but was nice enough.” Alleging that the average person’s cares were at a minimum at 19, and that one’s sense of adventure and willingness to “stay up and see where the night takes them” was at its peak, Lushniak advised all American adults to return to their post-adolescent, pre-adult lives as soon as possible. Additionally, Lushniak noted that Americans would experience a profound reduction in stress and fatigue by being 19, explaining that the only worries on a 19-year-old’s mind are “which couch they could crash on for the night” and “where to score a case of beer.” Though Lushniak stated that being 19 involves a certain level of risk, noting that such individuals were highly susceptible to stupid, reckless decisions, he assured reporters that such mistakes didn’t have serious consequences because you’re only 19 and damned if it doesn’t feel like you’re going to live forever. Moreover, Lushniak emphasized that the potential benefits of getting into a little trouble here and there, from joyriding with some buddies to jumping the state park fence and skinny-dipping after dark, far outweighed any potential negative side effects. “We found a wide variety of tangible benefits to being 19, from staying out until dawn and watching the sun come up over the lake with friends, to turning up the music as loud as it goes and never feeling more alive,” said Lushniak, who also urged citizens to smoke a few cigarettes or a joint if they wanted, as that’s what being 19 is all about. “It is the opinion of this office that the world is yours when you’re 19. It’s really, truly yours.” Furthermore, Lushniak stressed that, if possible, Americans should be at an age where they could put their whole paycheck toward an old motorcycle, one they could fix up and take out on the open road whenever they wanted, day or night. According to Lushniak, taking your bike and making your way across the country with no other plan than to have a good time wherever you could find it was associated with overwhelmingly positive outcomes among all subjects. In addition, Lushniak recommended scoring a fake ID; chasing some tail; feeling the breeze on your face and the sun on your bare shoulders; bonfires; laughing with your friends at 3 a.m. until it hurt; and getting that tattoo you want, because who’s going to tell you no? “Yes, I can say with utmost confidence that I think all Americans should be 19,” said Lushniak, a faint smile appearing on his lips as he looked off into the middle distance. “And once you’re 19, it is the government’s recommendation that you find yourself a nice, pretty girl and tell her to hold on tight while you point your bike to the west. Then just feel her grip growing tighter around your waist as you ride off wherever the road takes you. It doesn’t get any better than that—no, there’s nothing better than that at all.” After pausing several seconds, Lushniak added that for many citizens, however, being 19 was no longer a viable possibility, before sighing, noting with visible dismay that some Americans were stuck being 54, and solemnly stepping away from the lectern."
Report: Imagine How Good It Would Feel To Just Crawl Back Into Bed Right Now,1/21/14,974,"WASHINGTON—Citing its seductive warmth and utter remove from the demands and stresses of your daily life, a new study released today from the Pew Research Center has found that, man, wouldn’t it be incredible to just crawl back under the covers of your big, soft bed at this exact moment and just stay there for hours and hours? “Picture yourself cocooned in that fluffy comforter in your quiet, darkened bedroom, far away from everything and everyone surrounding you,” read the report in part, adding that “you need to close your eyes right now, at your desk or wherever you are, and really let yourself go to this place for a moment.” “Just sink into that pillow and let yourself drift off to sleep in total contentment. That’s it. That’s a baby. Shh. Don’t think. Just let your imagination transport you.” The report went on to further indicate how wonderful it would be, in fact, if you could close your eyes, fall into a deep, peaceful slumber, and never wake up again."
Tips For Getting Over The Flu,1/09/14,141,Flu season is in full swing with at least 25 states reporting widespread cases of the illness. Here are The Onion’s tips for beating the flu:
Offensive Lineman Opens Up Massive Hole In His Frontal Cortex,1/06/14,775,"PASADENA, CA—Exploding out of the three-point stance and driving the Auburn defender backwards, Florida State left guard Josue Matias reportedly opened up a massive hole in his frontal cortex Monday during the National Championship game. “Wow, he just slammed into the defensive lineman with such unbelievable force,” commentator Brent Musburger said of the catastrophic collision that created a huge hole in the middle of the frontal lobe and sprang the Seminoles’ ball carrier free for a three-yard gain. “He came barreling up the field and BOOM, just loosened the whole thing up. This is a BCS Championship memory that he’ll always [scarcely] remember.” Following the play, a dazed and disoriented Matias wandered back 15 yards after a teammate was penalized for clipping."
New Antidepressant Makes Friends’ Problems Seem Worse,1/02/14,1354,"INDIANAPOLIS—Offering a promising new treatment for those suffering from depression, pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly introduced a new antidepressant Wednesday that causes patients to perceive their friends’ problems as far worse than their own. “After just a single dose, clinical trial participants’ moods improved dramatically as they began to believe that each of their close friends was struggling with serious financial, professional, familial, and medical issues,” said drug developer Eugenio Risso, explaining that 9 out of 10 subjects reported markedly lower levels of pessimism, self-doubt, and generalized unhappiness after they began to sense that those around them were on the verge of full-scale emotional breakdowns. “This drug allows depressed patients to concentrate exclusively on their friends’ troubles and mentally magnify them, enabling them to, for example, construe an insignificant argument between a couple they know as a sign that these individuals are in the middle of a catastrophic marital crisis. And we found that that thought alone is enough to improve the subject’s mood for a week or longer.” Risso warned that patients must not exceed recommended dosages of the drug, as extreme magnification of former classmates’ and coworkers’ misery was found to produce an overwhelming and highly addictive sense of euphoria."
"Friends, Family Say Derrick Rose Hasn’t Said Single Word In Past 17 Days",12/10/13,807,"CHICAGO—Close friends and family confirmed Tuesday that Bulls point guard Derrick Rose has remained completely silent for the past 17 days, failing to utter one word since learning that the torn meniscus in his right knee will cause him to miss a second consecutive season. “Derrick just sits there; he hasn’t even moved,” said a friend who wished to remain anonymous, adding that the three-time All-Star spends most of the day on the couch staring at the ceiling. “Yesterday he inhaled deeply like he was about to say something, but then he just sighed and changed the TV channel he was watching.” Rose’s mother, Brenda, reportedly visited over the weekend and told her pajama-wearing son to remain positive in the face of adversity—an encouragement sources said the 2011 NBA MVP responded to with a shrug."
Pretty Obvious Which Sibling Going To Have To Deal With All The Nursing Home Stuff,12/04/13,998,"LANSING, MI—Agreeing that really only one of them was suited to the task, if they’re being honest here, the adult children of local couple Ron and Lydia Barnes stated Monday that it was pretty clear which sibling would be handling all the nursing home stuff. “When the day comes, Sarah is obviously the one who will explain to Mom and Dad that it’s time for them to pack up and move into a retirement facility,” said Andy Barnes, 35, referring to his older sister, whom he identified as the one who calls the most often and has “even driven them to the rheumatologist once or twice.” “It’s a Sarah thing, for sure. She can handle those things easily enough: finding the right place, signing them up, dropping them off, stopping by regularly, making sure the bill gets paid on time. I actually think she’d kind of like doing it.” Sources confirmed that Ron and Lydia are hoping for Sarah as well, since the prospect of depending on one of their other children for care “absolutely terrifies [them].”"
Pathetic Hands Subject To Man’s Every Whim,12/04/13,854,"FREDERICK, MD—Calling them spineless and utterly devoid of dignity, witnesses described Wednesday how the pathetic hands of local man David Bromley allow themselves to be subjected to his every whim. “Look at how those meek little stooges obey his every command, no questions asked; have they no sense of shame at all?” said observer Jane Hadfield, 37, noting that if the subservient worms had an ounce of guts they would have stood up to Bromley years ago. “It’s as if they’re oblivious to how embarrassing it all looks. If he says right, they go right. If he says clench, these weak-willed saps clench until he tells them it’s okay to release. I bet you they’d press themselves against a hot stove if he wanted them to.” At press time, Bromley and a potential business client were forcing their respective minions to engage in a humiliating little hug."
Study: American Intestinal Bacteria Most Obese In World,11/19/13,1092,"SEATTLE—A study published Tuesday by the University of Washington revealed that the gastrointestinal bacteria of American citizens are the most obese in the world. “We found that American intestinal microorganisms consume an unhealthy diet rich in sugars, fats, and processed foods, and as a result, tend to be severely overweight compared to international averages,” said researcher Benjamin Singh, highlighting electron microscope images of American Bifidobacteria cultures that showed their bulging plasma membranes and thick layers of internal cytoplasm. “Indeed, most intestinal microbes residing in U.S. residents had difficulty propelling themselves around the GI tract with their flagella and spent most of their time ingesting saccharides in the same stationary position in the gut, which leaves them at high risk for chronic health problems and a shorter life cycle overall.” Singh added that there was little hope of curbing the obesity epidemic in the near future, noting that most American intestinal bacteria live in areas where nutritious food options simply are not available."
Cancer Researchers: ‘Don’t Get Cancer’,11/18/13,4132,"PHILADELPHIA—Calling the contraction of the disease “not good,” and saying that not having the illness is highly preferable to having it, oncologists representing the American Association for Cancer Research urged the U.S. populace Monday not to get cancer. The panel, which consisted of medical experts at the top of their respective fields in cancer research, education, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, addressed the media for 45 minutes, saying that people’s best hope in terms of living a long, cancer-free life is to never develop cancerous cells in any part of the body, ever. “After years of closely studying this illness and learning about how it grows and arbitrarily attacks vital organs throughout the body at an uncontrollable rate until one eventually dies, we have concluded that not having cancer is the best way to go,” said Dr. Robert Bertino, who specializes in molecular biology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. “If you are going to contract a harmful illness, get diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, meningitis, or even Type 2 diabetes. Anything but cancer. Cancer is just the worst.” “A lot of people die from it,” he added. “It’s bad.” According to specialists, people should not contract colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, stage IV lung cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or any one of the roughly 200 other known forms of cancer. In addition, researchers confirmed that if it comes down to having terminal vs. non-terminal cancer, both are undesirable, but non-terminal is recommended. However, oncologists said that even less threatening forms of the illness, such as non-melanoma skin cancer, should be steered clear of, with Bertino explaining that, “You have the surgery, you think it’s gone, it comes back for some reason, God knows why, and then it spreads to your lymph nodes, and that’s that.” AACR officials went on to recommend that individuals should avoid having a family history of cancer, and that if people must grow tumors, they should make sure to only develop benign ones. “When a patient comes in to visit me because they have malignant tissue in their breast or under their arm, the first thing I say is, ‘It would be much better if this hadn’t happened,’” said Dr. Sydney Drysdale, head of oncology at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. “I tell them I have studied this illness for decades, I’m the foremost expert when it comes to the spread of cancer, and then I look them in the eye and say cancer is literally the last thing I’d want in my body. I tell them it’s not a death sentence, but that it certainly could be. It’s cancer. You shouldn’t get it.” “Sometimes patients will ask about clinical trials and I’ll say clinical trials wouldn’t even be an issue if you hadn’t gotten cancer in the first place,” Drysdale continued. “My best advice: Don’t have abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissues.” Top cancer researchers throughout the country urged individuals to think of the benefits of not having cancer, such as being alive for a much longer period of time, feeling healthy, not putting your family through what will easily be the most difficult period of their entire lives, never feeling like you’re at the mercy of near impossible and hopeless science, and being able to die of natural causes and not cancer. Moreover, while 10 out of 10 oncologists recommended never having cancer, 100 percent of people who do not currently have cancer reportedly said they are much happier because of it. “If I could do it all over again, I would not have gotten cancer,” said 46-year-old Kevin Glanville, who is currently battling chronic myeloid leukemia. “Getting chemotherapy two times per week and constantly feeling weak and nauseous when there is a good chance the treatment won’t even work is much less attractive to me than, say, not dealing with those circumstances.” “My doctor contacted some colleagues of his who work in the cancer research lab at the Mayo Clinic,” he continued, “and they said that, for the foreseeable future, if there is any way I cannot have cancer anymore I should do that.”"
Man Just Going To Assume Apartment Has Functional Carbon Monoxide Detector Somewhere,11/13/13,723,"DALLAS—Saying that he’s never seen it but that there’s probably one around somewhere, 24-year-old web developer Doug Horton told reporters Wednesday he is willing to just assume his apartment has a functional carbon monoxide detector. “I’m sure there’s one on a wall in the kitchen, or maybe in the bedroom,” said Horton, sitting on his sofa as he briefly scanned his living room for a device that looked like it might raise an alarm in the event of a deadly gas leak. “There has to be one, right? And even if there wasn’t, I’d probably still be able to see or at least smell any carbon monoxide that got in here, so I’m not too worried.” At press time, reports confirmed Horton had decided to open a window “just in case.”"
Man Catches Bad Television Show Going Around Office,11/13/13,1073,"GLENARDEN, MD—Following a string of similar cases among coworkers this week, local consultant Eric Hubbard confirmed today that he had finally caught the bad television show going around his office. “I had a feeling I might catch it a couple days ago after Chris mentioned Season 1 was on Netflix, and by Wednesday I was home in bed marathoning the whole thing,” Hubbard said of AMC’s Hell On Wheels, the highly contagious western drama coworkers suspect started with Kristen in accounting and spread by word of mouth to other departments within days. “It’s been really bad so far. One of the worst shows I’ve caught in a while, actually. I’m super lethargic and I get headaches from staring at the screen too long. I’ll try to go in tomorrow, but even then I might have to leave early to finish the rest of Season 3.” When reached for comment, experts said the best way to avoid contracting the television show is to avoid primary contact with infected persons and stay away from public places where people may be discussing its premise and actor Common’s supporting role."
Rock Apparently Factors Into Girlfriend’s Shower Routine,7/16/13,3511,"SEATTLE—Saying he was confused about the full extent of its purpose as well as its overall benefit, local man Jacob Ferris, 25, nonetheless surmised today that the oblong rock located in girlfriend Sarah Milstein’s shower caddy must somehow factor into her bathing routine, sources confirmed. “I guess at some point while she’s showering, she rubs a rock on her body,” said Ferris, expressing what he claimed was “the only possible conclusion” about the light-gray rock in his girlfriend’s bathroom. “I mean, it looks sort of nice, so she could just have it there for decoration or something. But it’s usually right near all the other soaps and her loofah, so I think it’s probably something she actually uses while under the water.” “I really don’t know how it all works,” Ferris added. “All I know is that in between Sarah getting into the shower and getting out, there’s a rock involved.” Ferris, who said he was unable to determine exactly when in the showering process the rock first comes into play, told reporters he is equally clueless about what part of the body the rock is used on. In addition, Ferris said he occasionally inspects the roughly 3-ounce object when he’s in Milstein’s shower, and told reporters that the rock is nearly always wet and is occasionally moved to slightly different spots within the bathtub, leading him to believe that his girlfriend uses it fairly regularly. He also noted his girlfriend’s bathing time never seems particularly longer than the average person’s considering she has added a rock into the mix. Ferris added that all attempts to incorporate the rock into his own shower routine have ultimately been unsuccessful. “I tried rubbing it on my skin once, and it hurt,” Ferris said, concluding that pouring soap and water directly onto the rock neither made it softer nor easier on his skin. “I could maybe see how it could get some dirt off of your body, but it seems too painful to work. Her skin usually looks nice though, so maybe I’m wrong.” “There is a chance it could be a hair thing,” Ferris continued. “Maybe she rubs the rock in her hair? I don’t know.” Ferris confirmed he has considered numerous reasons for why his girlfriend uses the rock in the shower, including that she has some type of skin condition, that the rock is some sort of weird tradition her family has, or that everyone uses rocks in the shower and he has been out of the loop the entire time. “It could be for cleaning the bathtub,” said Ferris, adding he once suspected the rock was a device for making the bathroom smell nice, but then noticed it had no discernible smell whatsoever. “Like every few weekends she scrubs the tub with this rock? I guess I could see Sarah doing that.” While Ferris said he is mostly certain that the rock was initially purchased at a home goods store of some kind, he was not able to completely rule out the possibility it was just a rock that his girlfriend found on the ground and decided to put in her shower. “I wonder if I should put a rock in my shower for when she’s over here,” said Ferris, who said he once tried to locate a rock at a Bed Bath & Beyond, but left after not wanting to walk up to a sales clerk and ask them where they kept their “shower rocks.” “Or I could just tell her to leave a rock at my place if she wants.” “I’m probably not going to do that,” Ferris added. At press time, a visibly perplexed Ferris had seen the rock sitting in Milstein’s trashcan and then looked in the shower to see another rock sitting in its place."
"New Study Finds It Is Impossible To Lose Weight, No One Has Ever Done It, And Those Who Are Trying Should Give Up",6/10/13,2873,"WASHINGTON—According to a groundbreaking new study published Monday in the Journal Of The American Medical Association, it is impossible to lose weight, no one has ever lost a single pound of fat through diet or exercise, and those attempting to do so are advised to abandon their weight loss goals immediately. The study, conducted by scientists at The National Weight Control Registry, determined conclusively that shedding excess weight has never occurred, changing your appearance is impossible, and that it actually feels “pretty nice” to just give up and realize that you’re powerless to alter your body mass index in any way, shape, or form. “Our findings indicate that if you’re trying to lose weight, you will fail—and that’s because you can’t, no one has, and you need to stop trying because it will never happen,” said Dr. Rena Wing, lead author of the report. “You could work out every day and eat nothing, and you still wouldn’t lose an ounce. And the sooner you throw up your hands and make peace with that fact, the better off you’ll be.” “Our data demonstrates that you’re doomed to look the way you look,” Wing added. “You are stuck in your body and it’s never going to look any better than it does right now. In fact, it will only get worse.” According to the study, running on a treadmill every morning at 6 a.m. will not help anyone lose weight, and neither will cutting carbohydrates from one’s diet, eating smaller portions throughout the day, doing yoga, or hiring a personal trainer. In addition, the study went on to state that everyone who tried the previous methods have only ended up feeling disappointed and in some cases heartbroken, especially after individuals step onto a scale and realize that, after two weeks of healthy eating and nonstop exercise, they’ve actually gained two or more pounds. The report added that skinny people stay skinny, overweight people remain overweight, that’s how it has always been, that’s how it will always be, and every study, book, or news article you’ve ever read that has told you otherwise has been totally and completely wrong. “Going to the gym is a waste of time if you are doing it to lose weight,” said University of California physiologist Dr. Andrew Novak, adding that time working out would be better spent reading, spending time with your family, sleeping, watching television, or eating. “Now, if you are exercising to prevent heart disease or cancer, well, new evidence has come to light that exercise actually doesn’t help fend off any sort of debilitating illness. In fact, it never has, and the only thing that can help you avoid terminal diseases is pure, blind fate.” “Sorry,” he added. The study went on to say that while losing weight is impossible, gaining weight is not only well within the realm of what is physically achievable, but is “remarkably easy and 100 percent inevitable.”"
Michelle Obama Shutters 'Let's Move!' Program After Failed 3-Year Run,5/13/13,812,"WASHINGTON—Citing a “widespread disinterest bordering on contempt” for the program’s most basic aims, Michelle Obama announced Monday she was shutting down “Let’s Move!,” the initiative she created in 2010 to fight childhood obesity. “Though I had hoped ‘Let’s Move!’ would promote healthier habits among America’s children, it turns out our young people simply aren’t interested in moving—at all,” the first lady told reporters. “Seriously, not even a little. When I visit these schools and talk about exercise, most of the kids look back at me with blank stares. And the ones who do attempt to exercise clearly do not like it and stop almost immediately.” Obama added that she expects to achieve far more success with her forthcoming “Fine, Let’s Just Sit Here Stuffing Our Faces Until We Drop Dead!” campaign."
Mentally Unstable Man To Exhibit 1 Or 2 More Warning Signs Before Finally Doing This,5/09/13,963,"WHIPPANY, NJ—Local mentally ill man Michael Redding, 26, announced his intention Thursday to display one or two further instances of troubling behavior before finally going ahead and carrying out what he has planned. “I’ll do a couple more clearly disconcerting things in public locations in front of people who know who I am, then that’s it—I’m going through with it,” said the severely unstable man, noting that his increasingly erratic and worrisome conduct over the past few months has so far been ignored or gone unnoticed by his family, colleagues, and therapist. “Maybe I’ll blow up and scream at an acquaintance for no reason, or I might just become totally unresponsive and withdrawn—who knows? All I can say is that I’ll throw up about two more red flags and then it will be time.” At press time, Redding reportedly finished publishing a set of disturbing thoughts on social media and verbally threatened a coworker, and is now ready to act on his plan."
USDA Rolls Out New School Brunch Program For Wealthier School Districts,4/26/13,1053,"WASHINGTON—Declaring that every affluent child in America has the right to a well-balanced brunch, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the launch of a $40 million school brunch program aimed at distributing brioche french toast and smoked salmon to the nation’s richest school districts. “We found that 70 percent of students in wealthy communities were not receiving their recommended allowance of eggs Benedict and fresh-squeezed orange juice,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters Friday. “Quite simply, we believe all children of privilege deserve a proper, well-composed brunch plate with complimentary jalapeno cornbread mini muffins and honey butter on the side. With this new program, we can finally begin to offer the superior culinary experience that until now has been sorely missing in school cafeterias from Greenwich, CT to Palo Alto, CA.” Department officials said that if its brunch program proves successful, they remain open to the possibility of spending an additional $80 million annually to add live jazz music."
Surgeon General Warns Teens Cinnamon Challenge Is Not For Pussies,4/23/13,894,"WASHINGTON—According to an announcement Tuesday by the Surgeon General’s office, the “cinnamon challenge”—a new fad in which teens attempt to swallow spoonfuls of cinnamon without water—may be hazardous to pansy-ass teens who aren’t cool enough to handle it. “Spice-induced choking and aspiration cases can result in coughing, vomiting, and, in severe cases, pneumonia when undertaken by a total pussy who clearly has never been laid,” said U.S. Surgeon General Regina M. Benjamin, adding that lame little bitches who probably aren’t popular and will never be popular should refrain from inhaling powdered tree bark. “It is the recommendation of this office that if you’re not the type of person who will cry home to mommy because of a little toxic exposure to cinnamic aldehyde, you should take the challenge. Everyone else is doing it.” Benjamin went on to say, “Come on, it’ll be hilarious.”"
Report: Majority Of Americans Now Answering To Name 'Lardface',4/23/13,885,"WASHINGTON—According to a report published Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau, an estimated 54 percent of Americans now turn around whenever they hear the phrase “Hey, Lardface” spoken, up from 48 percent just five years ago. “Following a continued deterioration of dietary habits and a nationwide plummeting of self-esteem, people who respond to the name Lardface now make up a solid majority of the U.S. population,” acting census director Tom Mesenbourg said at a press conference, adding that in some parts of the nation the moniker is so common it has even begun to lose its negative connotation. “Similar results, particularly in the Midwestern states, have been tabulated for names such as Fat Fuck, Tubby, Tubbo, and Wide Load.” After hearing these last words spoken, several journalists in attendance reportedly looked up from their notepads as if someone were addressing them."

Mississippi Bans Soft Drinks Smaller Than 20 Ounces,3/28/13,1178,"JACKSON, MS—Citing a wish to maintain the quality of life for residents across the state, the Mississippi Senate on Thursday passed a bill outlawing the sale of soft drinks in containers smaller than 20 ounces. “We have a responsibility to ensure that Mississippians are consuming sugary beverages at an acceptably high and constant rate, and this ban will see to it that this standard is upheld,” said State Sen. Terry W. Brown (R-District 17) in a morning news conference, adding that the new law will be strictly enforced by state authorities and that any business caught selling soda, coffee, tea, lemonade, sports drinks, or energy drinks in standard cans or containers rather than 64 or 85-oz. cups will be subject to a fine. “This isn’t just about the comfort of individual consumers, it’s about the welfare and overall happiness of entire communities. The fact that a resident of this state could consume less than the equivalent of 16 packets of sugar in one beverage is simply unacceptable, and it demands immediate action.” Brown also called for stricter limits on diet sodas, the sale of which Mississippi lawmakers hope to restrict to minors by the end of the year."
Opposition To Soda Ban Sad Proof That Americans Still Fight For What They Believe In,3/13/13,1217,"NEW YORK—The mounting opposition to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s proposal to prohibit the sale of large-size soft drinks served as sad and sobering proof that Americans are still willing to fight for the causes they believe in, sources confirmed Wednesday. “While many argue that people in this country lack the passion and general informedness to meaningfully participate in matters of public policy, the fierce outcry against the soda ban provides depressing evidence that this is not entirely true,” said New York University sociologist Dr. Marvin Schafer, pointing to the recent flux of pathetic petitions, public demonstrations, and fervent calls to the mayor’s office, all of which have been aimed at maintaining unimpeded access to soda and other sweetened beverages larger than 16 ounces. “This embarrassingly powerful demonstration of democracy shows that, when their backs are against the wall, Americans are unfortunately still very willing to band together and stand up for what they believe in most. Specifically, soda.” At press time, an online petition demanding the White House make clear its position on the use of combat drone strikes against American citizens had garnered 14 signatures."
Procrastinating Surgeon Putting Off Coronary Bypass By Cleaning Entire Hospital,1/13/13,935,"NEW YORK—Sources at Columbia University Medical Center reported Sunday that cardiac surgeon Dr. Robert Klinge, 44, was putting off an impending coronary bypass procedure by cleaning the entire hospital. “I know that guy’s arteries are a mess, but so are the linens in the pediatric ward,” Klinge said following a morning of procrastination in which he had vacuumed the ER, taken out the hospital’s recycling, and sorted multiple trays of scalpels, adjusting the implements carefully until they were lined up perfectly parallel. “If I don’t clean this stuff now, I’ll spend the whole surgery focusing on how the floor could use mopping and the cafeteria windows need to be washed. Besides, I can always get up really early tomorrow and do the bypass then.” At press time, Klinge was reportedly applying a fresh coat of paint to the hospital’s loading dock and did not hear the intercom call indicating a “code blue” in the cardiac wing."
Overweight 6-Year-Old Vows To Change Lifestyle After Second Heart Attack,1/10/13,2485,"HOUSTON—Describing his second heart failure in the span of two years as “a real wake up call,” obese 6-year-old Nicholas Bleyer announced Tuesday that he was finally trying to turn his life around. The 155-pound kindergartner, who previously underwent bypass surgery in 2011 after going into cardiac arrest on a local seesaw, was reportedly at home eating a post-breakfast snack when he began complaining of chest pain and had to be rushed to the hospital. “After the second ‘big one,’ I figured my body was clearly sending me the message that I can’t go on living like this,” said Bleyer, pausing to catch his breath. “I’m serious this time. I’ve gotta start eating right, going to sleep at my bedtime, and getting some exercise instead of sitting on my ass all day watching Bubble Guppies marathons.” “The old ticker’s taken enough abuse already,” continued the overweight kindergartner. “I’m not looking to test fate here.” Admitting that he still suffered from some bad habits he picked up early in life, the 6-year-old vowed to reduce his caloric intake by cutting down on eating chicken fingers, hot dogs, and toaster pastries, as well as sticking to juice boxes instead of soda. As per his pediatrician’s orders, Bleyer also said he planned to begin a cardio workout routine that makes sense for someone his age, alternating days between chasing insects, spinning around in circles, and doing some “light playground work.” Yet despite his newfound resolve, Bleyer acknowledged that he should have been more aware of the warning signs in recent years. “My friends and I have always been big guys, but when my old preschool buddy Ethan dropped dead of a heart attack a few years ago while stacking blocks, that should have set off alarm bells,” said Bleyer, who also had lost an obese classmate who never woke up from naptime. “At the time I remember promising myself I’d join a Gymboree, but of course I never did. And now look at me. I’ve got the arteries of someone 12 times my age.” “Luckily, I’ve been given a second chance to work off this guy,” said the child, patting his gut. While the 6-year-old acknowledged that he had “dodged a bullet this time,” Bleyer told reporters that he wished he still had the stamina to play tag with the youngsters like he used to without feeling like his chest was going to explode. “I’m just grateful to get a new lease on life,” said the kindergartner. “If I eat right and stay active, who knows, maybe I could live to see double digits.”"
"I'm Truly Sorry For This, But You're About To Hear All About The Last Marathon I Ran",7/31/12,4404,"Listen, it's great catching up with you, and believe me, I'm really enjoying this conversation we're having, but I'm afraid I now have to do something that will make this exchange very awkward and unpleasant for you. I feel absolutely terrible about it, and so I want to give you fair warning: You're about to hear all about the marathon I just ran. I'm truly sorry, but I'm going to have to go pretty in depth about my months of preparation, talk all about the encouragement and support I received from friends and family, and give you a mile-by-mile assessment of my state of mind and physical condition during the race. I hate to say it, but it's going to take quite a bit of your time. Mile split times, cramping, hydration levels, chafing—you're about to hear all of that. Plus, I'll be dwelling on one point around mile 17 when I considered stopping but then decided to keep going because I'd already come so far. There's a lot to cover, so I want to be upfront and apologize right off the bat. This is going to be pretty unbearable. I'll inevitably start with how I carbo-loaded the night before the race, which by itself will not be a particularly long or objectionable story, but let me assure you it will segue right into an excruciatingly detailed explanation of the diet I maintain to stay in peak physical shape. And that, in turn, will lead into my training regimen, my special lightweight marathon gear, and, unfortunately for you, a lengthy period during which I expound upon the health benefits of distance running. I know this isn't the kind of thing you want to listen to—hey, no one does—but I'm going to include several anecdotes about my running partner Erik, a person you don't know and couldn't possibly be interested in hearing about. You'll learn that he's an attorney and a rock climber and that we're part of a team that does the Run for Leukemia 10k every year, which will be another whole five-minute aside right there. Sorry. Believe me, if I could stop myself from talking about this, I would. But I can't, and so I'm going to tell you all about my personal best time, and you're going to think to yourself, ""This guy's the fucking worst."" But here's the truly awful part: Out of politeness, you will have to pretend to be impressed by that number, even though to you it will seem completely arbitrary and hold no meaning at all. You'll also be hearing quite a bit about the sense of accomplishment I felt upon finishing the race. You're going to hate that, trust me. There will be detestable phrases like ""I never thought I could do it, but I did"" and ""It truly was a life-changing experience"" and ""It's a huge commitment, but definitely worth it."" I'll be repeating the number 26.2 an infuriating number of times. My God, I can barely express how insufferable I'm going to be. I'm so sorry, I know you've done nothing to deserve this, but right when you think I'm finished talking—just when you get your hopes up—I'll mention how this wasn't my first marathon, and then you're going to hear details of my three other full marathons, as well as a half marathon and a couple marathon relays I did. I can't even imagine how horrible it will be for you to hear how I believe I've progressed as a runner, but by that point in, there just won't be any getting around it. And while it is at best tangentially related, I may at any moment during the conversation launch into an agonizing digression on the merits of five-day juice cleanses. I beg your forgiveness. Worst of all, though, I'm definitely going to run other marathons in the future, so I'll have to tell you all about the various races I'm thinking about entering and the pros and cons of each course. Please, accept my deepest apologies in advance, because as excruciating as today's discussion is, it won't end here. Every single day during my weeks of preparation leading up to the next race, I'm going to make you stop whatever you're doing to tell you the number of miles I ran the previous evening. Isn't that awful? No one should have to listen to that. I'll also have to tell you that you should run one of these things, too. I honestly can't convey how intensely sorry I feel that these words will soon be coming out of my mouth, but I will actually say to you that if I can run a marathon, so can you. Wow, I'm really, really sorry. I don't know how you'll be able to tolerate this. But anyway, here goes."
New Study Finds Americans Need 6 Hours Of Sleep At Work,7/17/12,976,"PHILADELPHIA—A study published Monday in the Annals Of Internal Medicine concludes that the average American needs at least six full hours of uninterrupted sleep at work in order to leave the office feeling refreshed and alert. ""Millions of people are staying up way too late at work,"" said endocrinologist Hannah Presnall, adding that in order for the body to function properly, workers should arrive at their job, check and send e-mails for two to three hours, and be asleep by 11:30 a.m. at the latest. ""More and more people are pulling all-dayers and drinking coffee just to keep themselves awake for meetings and conference calls. But when compared with their better-rested coworkers, these individuals are far more likely to suffer from fatigue and decreased cognitive performance at home."" The study recommends that adults who continually find themselves awake at work take Ambien first thing in the morning so they can fall asleep as soon as they arrive at the office."
New Preventative Drug Would Kill People Before They Get Alzheimer's,6/06/12,902,"SILVER SPRING, MD—Calling it the single greatest breakthrough to date in Alzheimer's research, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday the approval of Proneva, a new medication that prevents the degenerative brain disorder by killing individuals before its onset. ""Clinical trials have shown that a single dose of Proneva can end the lives of patients who otherwise would have developed a serious and life-threatening illness,"" said FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh, explaining that in a recent study Proneva successfully prevented Alzheimer's in 87 of 87 people who were administered the drug. ""For the millions of Americans who already suffer from this disease or have shown early signs of dementia, we recommend commencing treatment as soon as possible."" According to Walsh, preliminary research also suggests Proneva may be equally effective at preventing cancer, AIDS, and heart attacks."
Paula Deen Sponsors .05K Walk For Diabetes Research,5/07/12,3148,"SAVANNAH, GA—Celebrity chef and restaurateur Paula Deen announced Monday that her recently launched Step for a Cure Foundation would host its first annual .05K fun walk on May 20 to raise money for Type 2 diabetes research. The star of the Food Network shows Paula's Home Cooking and Paula's Best Dishes said the .031-mile course would cover a half block of Whitaker Street in Savannah's Historic District and would be open to walkers of all skill levels. ""Diabetes is a devastating condition that keeps folks from enjoying a regular lifestyle and doing things they love, but with y'all's support, we can help the doctors get this disease licked,"" said Deen, who hopes to raise $500,000 with the event and has asked donors to sponsor walkers with a pledge of $1 to $5 per step. ""This .05K walk may be one heck of a challenge, but it's for such a good cause I'm darn sure gonna finish it."" ""Plus I want to show people that just because you're diabetic doesn't mean you can't get out there and move around a little,"" Deen added. Deen, who has suffered from the disorder since 2009 but only recently revealed her diagnosis while endorsing a diabetes drug for a pharmaceutical manufacturer, told reporters she had begun an exhausting training regimen to prepare for the 164-foot event, walking slowly on a treadmill for up to 15 seconds each day. According to the food media mogul who made a name for herself by drinking straight liquid butter on television, the .05K should take about an hour to complete and will provide a fun family atmosphere, with a band playing at the halfway point and walkers at the starting line being cheered on by spectators at the nearby finish line. In addition, Deen assured participants the walking route would include 32 water and aid stations, which will serve deep-fried, melt-in-your-mouth garlic cheese biscuits ""just in case anybody gets the butter tingles."" ""This is a fundraiser, not a race, so it's important to make sure nobody gets too winded or wears out their little ol' legs,"" said the bestselling author of a children's cookbook that suggests eating cheesecake for breakfast. ""Just go at your own pace. Nobody needs to walk fast or anything."" ""I'm sure I'll stop and rest part way and take a 20-minute breather myself,"" Deen added. ""It's easy to lose steam once you hit that wall around step 72."" In an effort to limit the depletion of energy in walkers' muscles during the ""fatiguing"" 1,969-inch hike, Deen suggested all participants load up on carbohydrates by eating a pan of her famous homemade batter-dipped French fries the night before the walk. ""We're asking folks to give whatever they can to help out, because if there's a more urgent cause than finding a cure for adult-onset diabetes, I sure as heck don't know what it is,"" said Deen, explaining that part of the fun-walk proceeds would be used to purchase insulin so those afflicted with the disease can continue eating as many ""yummy treats"" as they desire. ""Ain't it just the worst?"" ""Believe me, honey, I know how sad it is to say 'no thank you' to that second pan of brownies, or reduce your mayonnaise intake by a quart,"" Deen continued."

Health Department Still Not Able To Really Prove Why People Shouldn't Be Eating Candles,2/06/12,1041,"'They Won't Kill You Or Anything, But They Can't Be Good For You,' Say Officials WASHINGTON—Department of Health and Human Services officials held a press conference Monday to announce that while no studies had been conducted to establish that the practice is unhealthy, people still should not eat candles. ""While we doubt the ingestion of small amounts of candle wax is life-threatening, we nonetheless recommend that anyone thinking about eating candles refrain from doing so, and that anyone currently eating candles stop,"" said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who during a follow-up Q&A confirmed the guideline even applies to pumpkin-pie-scented candles and birthday candles with frosting and cake on the bottom half. ""Instead of conducting clinical trials on the long-term effects of candle consumption, we're just going to ask people to use their common sense on this one. Please don't eat candles."" At the same press conference, HHS officials also suggested that people shouldn't eat lip balm ""because, come on, don't be an idiot."""
Study Finds Hearing Loved One's Voice Induces Excruciating Pain In Coma Patients,1/14/12,3801,"BALTIMORE—According to a study published Monday in The New England Journal Of Medicine, people in comas experience excruciating, indescribable levels of pain whenever they hear the sound of a loved one's voice. The Johns Hopkins University study, which used fMRI brain-imaging technology to monitor the cerebral activity of more than 400 coma patients while friends and family members talked soothingly at their hospital bedsides, found that every second a loved one was speaking, subjects felt pain so agonizing that researchers have likened it to the sensation of having one's skin slowly removed with dull scissors before being doused in gasoline and set on fire. ""Whether the patient's sister was reading aloud from a favorite book or a spouse was relating shared happy memories, the data conclusively proved the participant was experiencing wave after wave of pain so torturous that you or I couldn't even begin to imagine it,"" said Dr. Adam Tyner, lead author of the study. ""After hearing a loved one speak, every single coma patient we observed exhibited a huge spike in activity within the pain centers of the brain, at levels comparable to those of someone dropped into a vat of hydrochloric acid and then forced to roll around in salt."" ""If you are in any way significant to or loved by a coma patient, it appears visiting that person in the hospital is the absolute worst thing you can do to him or her,"" Tyner continued. ""You have to understand, if these individuals could speak, they would be screaming at their loved ones to please, for the love of all that is good and holy, stop talking."" Tyner said the data also proved that patients were very much cognizant of their surroundings and seemed to know precisely who was causing them the worst pain any human being could possibly experience. He went on to stress that what the subjects were experiencing was not simply emotional pain, but a very real and horrible physical pain, similar to the sensation of being dragged naked behind a truck over miles of jagged lava plains covered with tacks and broken glass. ""During trials in which a young son or daughter urged a parent to please, please just wake up, the pain reached an intensity so severe we can safely hypothesize these patients would gladly have jumped to their deaths from hospital windows cursing their children's names, had they the capacity to do so,"" Tyner said. In addition, the study found many other stimuli besides vocalizations that caused immense pain in coma patients. The smell of fresh flowers, the presence of Mylar balloons, or a loved one gently running fingers through the subject's hair all caused pain so extreme it would cause a healthy person to mercifully black out. However, because of their condition coma patients are unable to scream for help, and are instead  forced to remain completely silent and aware as they endured a pain 10 times worse than that of a torture victim. ""No stimulus compared to utterances of 'I love you,'"" Tyner said. ""Those three words resulted in a pain that has no known equivalent, but the closest approximation would be the sensation of hot, rusty needles flowing through one's very blood stream."" Tyner said that the full implications of the study were still not totally clear, but that loved ones could take immediate steps to improve the palliative care of those in comas. ""Don't talk to them, don't gaze upon them lovingly, don't even think about them,"" Tyner said.  ""Not surprisingly, the evidence suggests those in comas are so sensitive they can  faintly pick up sympathetic thoughts from friends and family, which also causes them terrible, unimaginable pain."" ""The best advice I can give is that if you care for these people at all, just leave them completely alone until they either wake up or die,"" Tyner added."

LASIK Surgery Allows Baron To See Without Monocle,10/29/11,980,"KÖNIGSBERG, EAST PRUSSIA—Baron Fritz von Friedrich VII, steward of Württemberg, told reporters Saturday that the LASIK surgery he recently underwent to correct the vision in his left eye has been an unmitigated success, allowing him to see without the aid of a monocle for the first time in 30 years. ""I grew so dreadfully weary of affixing my monocle whenever I wished to look over a writ concerning one parcel of land or another,"" said the baron, adding that the sunglass monocle he had to wear while his eye recovered was worth the inconvenience, though its darkened lens forced him to rely upon the opinion of his manservant when selecting a dressing gown each morning. ""Now if only they had some miracle remedy for my terribly sensitive hands so I didn't have to wear these wretched white gloves all the time!"" Von Friedrich added that he was most grateful for the fact that he will never again have to wear contact monocles, the gold chains of which badly irritated his eye."
FDA Approves Putting Picture Of Trish On Cigarette Packs,10/26/11,3989,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to accurately portray the risks of smoking tobacco, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved rules Wednesday that will require all cigarette packaging to bear a large warning label featuring a graphic image of Trish. FDA commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg told reporters the new labeling, which depicts the face of 32-year-old chain-smoker Trish and will be mandatory as of Feb. 1, 2012, is part of an ongoing campaign to inform Americans about the gruesome consequences of smoking tobacco. ""We believe displaying a photo of Trish on every pack of cigarettes sold will help discourage young people from starting this deadly habit and also motivate current smokers to quit,"" Hamburg said. ""I'm certain Americans of all ages will instantly understand the devastating repercussions of tobacco use after confronting the picture of Trish at a bar gesturing with a cigarette and cackling hoarsely."" ""What if that were you or someone you cared about?"" Hamburg added. ""It really shows the ruinous impact that smoking can have on your life."" Representing the largest health initiative launched by the FDA in recent years, the new warning label will also include a single line of text: ""Cigarettes caused Trish."" According to government officials, disturbing imagery of rotting gums and teeth, disease-ridden lungs, a corpse in a morgue, and a deformed infant have all proven far less effective at conveying the dangers of smoking than a single picture of Trish smiling. Numerous clinical trials have shown that more than 90 percent of individuals responded with feelings of intense nausea and despair when shown the photo of Trish with her face under a fluorescent light, bringing a cigarette to her lips. ""An estimated 443,000 Americans are killed by smoking every year, so obviously we need a straightforward image that accurately depicts the pain and suffering caused by cigarettes,"" said Lawrence R. Deyton, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. ""Nearly every one of our study participants reacted to Trish's photo by saying it was one of the most disturbing images they'd ever seen."" ""It's true that the warning label with Trish is both shocking and revolting, but it's also the only way to reach people,"" Deyton added. While many Americans agreed that placing Trish's image on cigarette packs would definitely deter some potential consumers, others have called the scare tactic reprehensible. ""To walk by and see Trish's photograph plastered on every carton in the cigarette display is a bit extreme, I think,"" St. Louis resident Paula Kauth said. ""I could see a written warning describing her scrunched up face, double chins, and stained tank top, but to show that picture is just too much, especially for more sensitive shoppers."" ""It'll make people physically sick while they're standing in line,"" Kauth added. ""What point does that prove?"" Steve Ponzoch, a native of Omaha, NE and smoker for the past 15 years, called the photo ""fucking nasty,"" and remained convinced the image must have been doctored to look extra offensive. ""You could smoke fifty packs a day and I'm sure it would kill you long before you ever looked like Trish,"" Ponzoch said. ""It's unfair. That's totally false advertising. They must have used a computer or something to make it appear more explicit, because it honestly doesn't even look realistic."" Meanwhile, other critics have claimed the photo is too tame, arguing the true ramifications of the habit cannot be clearly demonstrated without a full-body shot of Trish holding up a cigarette while wearing a two-piece bikini that reveals her flabby stomach, chunky thighs, and faded Blues Traveler tattoo. ""If they want the public to stop smoking, they need a striking image that will stick in people's mind forever,"" Dr. Len Litchtenfeld of the American Cancer Society said. ""And to do that they're going to need a photograph of Trish in which see gazes upon the viewer with a grotesque look of genuine lust in her eyes."""
"Report: 40,000 People Died On Ferris Wheels This Summer",10/20/11,908,"NEW YORK— In its annual report of carnival and amusement park fatalities released Thursday, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that 40,000 riders lost their lives in Ferris wheel accidents during the summer of 2011. ""Approximately 18,000 riders slipped out of their safety restraints and fell, suffering repeated traumas as they hit each spoke of the moving wheel on their way to the ground,"" said OSHA spokesperson Ben Simmons, who cited routine wear on the machines as the underlying cause of most fatalities. ""We estimate 9,500 were engulfed in flames, 4,600 starved to death, and 17 fell victim to the Ferris Wheel Slasher, who is evidently still at large. Overall, Ferris wheel fatalities increased 6 percent from the summer of 2010."" The report also listed 294 deaths from three separate incidents in which a Ferris wheel detached from its axle and rolled into other Ferris wheels."

Quiz: Is Your Weight Keeping You From Getting Drunk?,3/04/11,1004,"This blog entry is reprinted with permission from the Department of Health and Human Services. Studies show an individual with a BMI of more than 30 needs six shots of premium grade vodka to feel even mildly buzzed, whereas someone with a BMI between 20 - 25 only needs half of that to lose all of his or her inhibitions. Isn’t that all the reason you need to maintain a healthy weight? Take this quiz to find out if your weight may be affecting your ability to become intoxicated in a timely manner: 1) Do you usually have to carry one of your skinny friends to the bathroom to vomit before you even feel buzzed? 2) Are you are able to drive perfectly after shot-gunning four Keystones? 3) Do you have to drink an entire bottle of Jagermeister before you want to fight someone? 4) Are you friends unable to lift you for a keg stand? 5) Does a game of beer pong leave you out of breath but not drunk? If you answered “yes” to any of the questions above, talk with your doctor about a weight-loss program."
Healthy Living Tips For Shawnas,2/18/11,1303,"This blog is reprinted with permission from the Department of Health and Human Services Having a healthy lifestyle isn't just about staying out of the sun (or out of a tanning bed). Here are some simple tips to help Shawnas participate in a healthier life: Eat Right
Corn nuts and jalapeno poppers are not a suitable meal. Eating a balanced, nutritious diet can help you get back in to your acid-washed jeans and fringed Styx crop top that you haven't been able to put on since '97. Don't Smoke
Smoking increases your risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and running into your ex, Rick, outside the 7-11. Besides, smoking can turn your remaining teeth brown. Above all, never smoke while pregnant as it is very harmful for your unborn children. Don't forget how Tammy turned out. Limit Alcohol Use
Alcohol can raise your risk of liver disease, cancer, and the likelihood that you'll have promiscuous sex with Darryl's cousin again. Drinking more than four drinks in a row is considered binge drinking for a woman. Note: if you are drinking directly from a bottle of Malibu, that does not count as just one drink. Practice Injury Prevention
Make sure to check under your trailer on a regular basis for evidence of rodents, fire hazards, and your brother Kevin who might try to cook meth under there again."

Department Of Health And Human Services Recommends Standing At Least Once A Day,1/31/11,3134,"WASHINGTON—As part of an ongoing campaign to promote physical fitness and well- being, the Department of Health and Human Services is urging all Americans to set aside time at least once a day to stand. Speaking to reporters Thursday, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius extolled the numerous benefits of regular standing, explaining that it can be central to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. ""We recommend placing two feet on the ground shoulder-width apart, straightening out the legs, and then locking the knees to hold an upright position,"" said Sebelius, adding that just about anyone can start standing regardless of age or prior experience. ""Supporting your own weight while keeping your torso erect won't just make you feel better. It will also force much-needed blood to your legs—and the positive effects will continue long after you've sat back down."" ""So get out there and stand,"" she continued. ""One to two times a day, if possible."" In conjunction with the announcement, HHS officials are distributing a free poster to the public with guidelines on how to stand safely and efficiently. The instructions, along with illustrations to show each separate phase of movement, caution beginners to rise slowly, brace against a sturdy object for support, and always be under the supervision of a spotter. While the poster lists as an initial goal the ability to stay up for five seconds, it suggests those who have mastered the basics aim for at least three minutes of moderate standing per session. Advanced standers, classified as those who can easily maintain the position for 10 minutes or more, are urged to also try lifting their arms to eye level and, if they're feeling up to it, taking a step. ""We don't want people to push themselves too hard too quickly and get hurt,"" said HHS Deputy Secretary Bill Corr, noting the importance of saving enough energy to bend one's knees and sit back down. ""If done correctly, though, standing can be a fun activity people actually look forward to each day."" According to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, the number of Americans who stand daily has dropped 32 percent in the past decade. In an effort to reverse the trend, HHS is hoping to increase its education and outreach programs so that the majority of citizens are standing regularly by 2016. Dallas resident Joshua Miller, who recently signed up for a standing class at his local gym, told reporters that while adding a standing regimen to his daily routine has at times been challenging, he believes that he will eventually see results. ""You can really feel it in your legs; it's hard work,"" Miller said. ""There are some days when I'm so exhausted that the thought of putting on my clothes and standing just sounds like the last thing in the world I'd want to do, but I try hard to push through. I know the more I stand, the more energy I'll have later on for other things, like eating."" HHS officials were also quick to note that proper stretching and breathing techniques should be performed before and after every session in order to avoid common standing- related afflictions such as vertigo and stander's knee."

"So We Meet Again, The Croup",4/20/10,3918,"How very curious. The patient seems to be displaying some highly unusual symptoms. There doesn't appear to be any swelling of the lymph nodes, yet I detect signs of a fever and the boy complains of nausea. Hmm, I wonder. Clearly, this is no common cold I'm dealing with here. No, something about this child's sickness is almost reminiscent of…could it be? Why, yes, of course! How could I have missed it? That distinctive barking cough; the constricted breathing; the hoarseness of the patient's voice. It could only mean one thing… It is the vile handiwork of none other than my greatest adversary, acute laryngotracheobronchitis. Or should I call you by your real name, The Croup? My old nemesis. Well, well, well. I thought I had seen the last of you back in the Washington Heights Children's Memorial Hospital. I watched as white blood cells aided by steady doses of corticosteroids tore you apart. There's no way you could have survived! Thanks to the quick-thinking mother who recognized your symptoms in time, I had you just where I wanted you. Or so I thought. What was the name of that case? Ah, yes, it was ""The Case Of The Young Boy Who Caught The Croup."" But alas, it appears you escaped your just fate yet again. I can't say that l'm surprised. Naturally, I was thrilled to have finally bested you once and for all. And yet, now that I am confronted with you once again, I sense that old feeling returning to me: that intoxicating surge of adrenaline that seizes me each time we enter into our delicate dance of good and evil. It is exhilarating, is it not, The Croup? Of all the vile foes I have battled in the past—Chicken Pox, Rubella, The Mumps—none has challenged me quite like you. Part of me, I must admit, almost…missed you. It's impossible, really, to imagine a life without you, my age-old archrival. Even though you're a respiratory illness that tends to strike young children and I am a twice-divorced pediatrician in his mid-60s, some might say that we're two sides of the same coin, you and I. It's as though we were made for each other. Ah, who could forget our first thrilling duel in Eugene, OR? I was only a medical student back then, but I recognized immediately that you were no simple ailment of the air passages. Your cunning and resourcefulness were so utterly devious and yet so exquisite. And what about our epic battle of wits in Toledo? How fondly I remember that particular encounter. You didn't really think I would fall for the old ""I'm just a mild case of Whooping Cough"" routine, did you? You underestimated me, my friend! But what you did to that young boy in Austin 10 years ago was unspeakable. Why did you do it, The Croup? Why? It was me you were after, not the boy. The memory of that dire day haunts me always. That is why I will never rest, never give up until I have expunged your heartless villainy once and for all. And now, the hour of your defeat is finally at hand. Look around you, The Croup. There is nowhere to turn now. No upper airways for you to retreat into. Why, whatever is the matter? Are you…scared? Do you sense your victory is slipping away from you? You sense yourself weakening, don't you? Yes, yes, your astonishment is filling the room. You are asking yourself, ""How did he beat me?"" It is simplicity itself, my dear Croup. Allow me to explain: You see, I always knew you would be back. I knew you couldn't resist. So, over the past six months, I have subtly let my guard down just enough to lure you back in. And now, thanks to a little help from my trusted colleagues at the Merck corporation, I have secured just enough precious Decadron to foil your dastardly plot. Once again, The Croup, it was your arrogance that was your ultimate undoing. Until we meet again, my darling adversary… Mrs. Weiss, give Brian two of these every day for at least a week and make sure he gets plenty of fluids and rest and he should be fine. Take care, now."
"Passage Of Health Care Reform Brings Democrat-Republican Score To 317,622-318,047",4/20/10,800,"WASHINGTON—With their legislative victory on health care last month, Democrats narrowed by one point the gap in their 150-year-long competition with Republicans, bringing the current score between the rival political parties to 317,622-318,047. ""The Republicans had a really strong first half, racking up points with their opposition to slavery and extension of citizenship to Native Americans,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said at a press conference Monday.

"Republicans, Leukemia Team Up To Repeal Health Care Law",4/08/10,3615,"WASHINGTON—Citing a mutually shared vision of health care in America, congressional Republicans and the deadly bone-marrow cancer leukemia announced a joint effort Wednesday to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the historic new bill that extends health benefits to 32 million Americans nationwide. ""Republicans have no greater ally in this fight than leukemia,"" said Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC), who was flanked by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH), and the abnormal increase in white blood cells. ""Denying insurance to Americans with preexisting conditions and ensuring that low-income Americans stand no chance of receiving quality health care are just a few of the core beliefs that the GOP and leukemia share."" ""And believe me, if anyone is angrier than the Republican Party that children can no longer be denied coverage for having preexisting conditions, it's leukemia."" DeMint continued. ""We're a match made in heaven."" In the coming weeks, Republicans and leukemia will travel the country in an effort to diminish support for the increasingly popular bill, which GOP sources said goes against everything that Republicans and the massive accumulation of toxic cells stand for. According to party leaders, all forms of the deadly blood disorder, including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and large granular lymphocytic leukemia will lend their support to the Republican effort. ""I look around and I see Sen. Bob Bennett, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, eosinophilic and megakaryoblastic leukemia, and Sen. Pat Roberts, and I think, 'This is what the Republican Party is all about,'"" Sen. McConnell said. ""We don't like this new bill. We don't like that it will cut the national deficit by $1.3 trillion over the next 20 years. We don't like that it's now illegal for insurance companies to suddenly drop a parent for getting deathly ill. That's why we're so very proud to be working with leukemia."" While chronic leukemia was reportedly worried about how its association with the Republican Party would affect its public image, the destructive pathogen was ultimately swayed by language in the final bill that offers small business owners tax incentives to provide health care to their employees. ""Getting chronic on board was key,"" one Republican strategist said. ""It made it politically viable for acute [leukemia] to join the repeal the effort."" A longtime ally of the Republican Party, leukemia also supported GOP efforts to stop President Bill Clinton from passing sweeping health care reform in 1994. A decade later it endorsed President George W. Bush's Medicare legislation, which effectively forced many senior citizens to pay full cost for prescription drugs. And in 1971 it supported President Richard Nixon's escalation of the Vietnam War into Laos. ""Leukemia has always been a disease that veers to the right,"" said Newsweek columnist Ezra Klein, adding that Republicans have also sought out the support of high-profile illnesses such as sickle-cell anemia, type 1 diabetes, and sepsis. ""And at the end of the day, you can't ignore the fact that this deadly blood disorder has a lot to lose if the bill succeeds."" Thus far, Republicans and leukemia are confident that the bill will be repealed. ""In 2010 leukemia and the Republican Party will make history,"" a spokesman for the illness said. ""Because years from now, when people look back and ask who was on the right side of the issue, they'll remember the day that Republicans and leukemia came together to make a real, permanent difference in the lives of millions of Americans."""

Yet just this morning, a cashier at the coffee shop in the hospital I can now legally work at again actually said it right to my face. ""Here's your change, mister."" Exact words. As if I didn't just drop $1,200 on that board-certified course to earn back the title ""doctor"" after the regrettable events of last May. Where does he get off? Am I the world's best doctor? Absolutely not. But I am nowhere near the worst, either. And I'm certainly not the first to accidentally remove the wrong kidney and then have to be restrained by orderlies when the family has the nerve to question my excuses. So what makes them—or anyone with a loved one whom I may or may not have permanently injured through negligence or outright drunkenness—think they have the right to refer to me as one of their own? It's not like they drove 45 miles every Tuesday and Thursday night to share a community college classroom with other disgraced physicians,† did they? Now that I've relearned the basic attitudes and morals that should act as an obvious guide for someone in the medical profession, I expect to be called ""doctor"" in every circumstance. And if you disagree, then just take a look at what's hanging on my wall: that diploma, the medical license with the large red ""X"" stamped over it, and that other, smaller license that states I can practice medicine under certain probationary terms and conditions for the next 90 days. That's right. According to the great state of South Carolina's Board of Medical Examiners, I should be afforded the honor and courtesy of my position, even if you're part of that class-action suit pertaining to the tainted blood. The lady who accused me of sexual misconduct six years ago had the respect to call me Dr. Berstyn when she pointed me out from the witness stand. So should you. But it's bigger than me and the now two separate occasions upon which I've taken the Hippocratic oath. It's about tradition. The title of doctor is steeped in history. It is a recognition of years of hard work, and it lets the community know that this particular person has paid the $25,000 in fines required by the courts. Even if his lawyer still thinks he can get that reduced to $15,000. So when I run across people like this coffee shop worker, it makes me sad, because it shows just how much our society has fallen. You see, not being called ""doctor"" doesn't just affect me. It affects everyone in our hallowed trade who ever toiled for years in medical school or took a bribe so someone would be moved higher on the organ donation list. If one of us gets caught in the resulting sting operation, then, in a way, we all get caught in the resulting sting operation. You could say that the ethics class I was forced to take has made me a better doctor. It reminded me that signing every sheet in your prescription pad and leaving it in a spot where it will inevitably disappear and be replaced with an envelope full of money is not only legally wrong—it's also morally wrong. I know that now. The teacher, Dr. Brian, even helped me see that my patients were people with feelings, no matter how little money they make or how ignorant they are about medicine. I wish I could go back in time and redo those out-of-court settlement meetings with that babyless couple. There'd be a lot less swearing and threats of physical violence on my part. I'm just a different person now. So, yes, the mandatory medical license reinstatement ethics class was difficult, and sometimes humiliating, but it was worth it. The nine months I endured without a license were very dark indeed. Not because I couldn't practice medicine—which I definitely did—but because people were not technically required to call me ""doctor."" Now they are, and by God, I will make sure they say it loud and clear. Unless they're one of those poor kids whose tongues I accidentally removed."

Alzheimer's Disease Causing Baby Boomers To Misremember 1960s Even More,2/04/10,4125,"PALO ALTO, CA—Alzheimer's researchers at Stanford University published a study this week showing that the degenerative brain disease is beginning to affect the baby boomer generation, causing many to remember the 1960s even less accurately than they normally would. ""We're seeing men and women who have spent so much of their lives misremembering the past grow even more detached from reality,"" said neuroanatomist Dr. Arthur Rothensen, who conducted the study. ""This terrible disease has made thousands of boomers' memories of the 1960s almost completely unreliable and fragmented. And we're talking about people who, even before they contracted Alzheimer's, believed they single-handedly ended the war in Vietnam."" Added Rothensen, ""It's just sad, really."" The study, which surveyed more than 1,500 baby boomers, found that Alzheimer's disease had a noticeable effect on those already suffering from ""selective memory loss,"" and only added to the unrealistic and often romanticized nature of personal accounts from the time period. Among the survey's participants, those who for decades had misremembered the '60s as a rose-colored utopia in which everything and anything was possible were 38 percent less likely to accurately recall the past. ""Dad always used to exaggerate his experience of the 1960s, but now he's totally gone,"" said Dylan Finster, who recently moved his father Harold into managed care. ""It was bad enough when he would go on and on about being at Woodstock, and how it completely changed the world for the better. But these days, not only did Woodstock change the world, he was also airlifted out of Hanoi with Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane in 1969."" ""I miss those old, innocent lies,"" Finster continued. According to the Stanford study, the growing dementia of Harold Finster is not uncommon. In fact, the ability of baby boomers to remember the more negative aspects of the '60s, such as the infighting among many activist movements, the inherent sexism behind free-love attitudes of the day, and the dangerous blurring of lines between harmless experimentation and full-blown drug-abuse, almost always grew worse after diagnosis with the degenerative brain disease. ""I was washing dishes at Alice's Restaurant when Lt. William Calley ran in and shot Bobby McGee Kennedy right there in front of me,"" said 66-year-old Jacob Schwartz, a participant in the study who suffers from Alzheimer's. ""It was the hottest Summer of Love on record, which was probably why all the blacks were playing in the fire hoses. They were having such a good time! We all were!"" ""I remember when Marvin Gaye sang that 'I Have A Dream' song in Washington, D.C.,"" 63-year-old participant Shirley Meneken said. ""Everything was perfect after that. There were no more problems or disagreements after that song. Everything was so good and perfect! And we were there! We did it! Nobody felt any disillusionment years later."" In addition to mixing fact with fiction, confusing progressive action with being stoned out of their minds, and holding onto impossibly positive recollections of what was in reality a very complicated time, a majority of baby boomers in the study also misremembered the decades that followed. ""Zero of 1,500 subjects admitted to remembering anything about the disco-malaise of the 1970s, the surface-level materialism of the 1980s, or the overindulgent parenting of the 1990s,"" Alzheimer's Research Center director Robert Feinmann said. ""It's almost as if those memories are too painful to deal with, either because they're ashamed of them or because they're so unbelievably lame. Either way, to most boomers, it's like those times happened to someone else."" ""Essentially, we're dealing with a group whose values have always been malleable—they rebelled against a 'greatest generation' of war-winning parents whom they now worship, they always claimed to have changed society by refusing to participate in it and even claimed they invented rock and roll,"" Feinmann continued. ""Yes, Alzheimer's may be loosening their grip on reality, but we're not sure how firm it was to begin with."""

Montessori School Of Dentistry Lets Students Discover Their Own Root Canal Procedures,11/20/09,3588,"NEW YORK—Inside the Montessori School of Dentistry, you won't find any old-fashioned cotton swabs, or so-called periodontal charts, or even any amalgam fillings. That's because at this alternative-learning institution, students are being encouraged to break away from medical tradition and discover their very own root canal procedures. ""At Montessori, we believe dentistry is more than just the medical practice of treating tooth and gum disorders,"" school director Dr. Howard Bundt told reporters Tuesday. ""It's about fostering creativity. It's about promoting self-expression and individuality. It's about looking at a decayed and rotten nerve pulp and drawing your own unique conclusions."" ""In fact, here at Montessori, dentistry is whatever our students want it to be,"" Bundt continued. Founded in 1981, and tailored after the teaching methods first developed by Italian-born educator Maria Montessori, the three-year academy offers a fresh and innovative approach to learning seldom found at more conventional schools of dentistry. Teachers—or ""roving dental facilitators,"" as they prefer to be called—can be difficult to spot: They often choose to stay out of the way of their inquisitive pupils, and only make gentle suggestions as to how an infected root chamber should be drained. ""When performing a root canal, there's no such thing as right or wrong,"" said Montessori educator Vanessa Perrin, who added that she doesn't so much teach her students how to treat an inflamed nerve, as lead them to an open mouth and then stand back. ""Sure, we could say to our students, 'The enamel here has completely eroded and needs to be addressed immediately.' But what's more satisfying, what's more dynamic, is to just let them slowly develop an 'impression' of why a patient might be screaming."" ""We try to encourage our students to work with their patients in order to determine a successful course of action,"" Perrin added. ""That's one of the many reasons why we don't believe in using any anesthesia during surgical procedures."" According to administrators, the Montessori School of Dentistry strives to present an alternative to the dogmatic structure of other schools. In addition to being able to set their own curriculum, students at the private institution can take a break during long and involved operations if they grow bored or feel uninspired. The confining and antiseptic atmosphere of tradition is absent even from the classrooms themselves, relaxing environments that are sometimes filled with comfortable, overstuffed sofas rather than dentist chairs. ""If a student is installing a crown, and feels midway through as though he or she would benefit more from, say, seeing where a tooth implant might lead, they can do that here,"" said Montessori professor Donald Scheneke, who told reporters that he sees the dentist office as a place for exploration and expression, not rules. ""In here, there's no such thing as 'absentmindedly drilling through to the lower gum' or 'mistakenly pulling out the wrong maxillary lateral incisor.' I can't tell you the number of times I've seen people give up on the entire dentistry profession just because they were terrible at filling cavities."" Recent graduates from the small, independent school agree. ""Thanks to my professors at Montessori, I feel like I can handle any professional challenge that comes my way,"" Dr. David Greenblatt, DDS, said as a syringe filled with Novocaine dripped slowly into the back of a patient's throat and down into his lungs. ""Or, at the very least, accept that it's not the end of the world if I can't."""
This Would Be The Best Mental Hospital Ever If Elliott Gould Weren't Hiding In The Toilet,11/19/09,3594,"I've been a patient at the Sunhaven Mental Health Center for about six months now, and I honestly can't say enough about what a fantastic institution it is. Whether it's the beautiful grounds, the progressive methods for treating various psychiatric disorders, or the highly experienced staff of therapists, nurses, and orderlies happy to provide for one's every need, Sunhaven is, for the most part, an outstanding facility. So I hope I don't sound ungrateful when I point out that Elliott Gould has been hiding in the toilet for at least a month now, and I'm the only one who seems to care. Not that the bathroom facilities here aren't otherwise exceptional, of course. In fact, I doubt there's another psychiatric hospital in the state with showers this clean. But am I really supposed to just turn my head and not notice when Elliott Gould pops out of the toilet tank like a jack-in-the-box and tells me he's going to be monitoring my excretory habits for the next 50 years? Frankly, I expect more from a mental health center of this caliber. It's not just the one toilet, either. Elliott Gould is in all of them. I'll sprint across the hall and down four flights of stairs to a distant bathroom, trying to outrun him, but he's always there waiting for me. You'd be amazed how fast Elliott Gould can move through central plumbing. All I'm saying is that it's a little difficult to enjoy a nice nap under Sunhaven's beautiful Georgian-style portico or a meal in its first-class dining area when you know that Elliott Gould is waiting for you in that bathroom stall with a 20-page urine questionnaire. And no one around here appears bothered by any of this, which is weird, because the staff is normally so on top of things. Every little detail—well-stocked vending machines, fresh flowers in the common room—is attended to, but for some reason they all just look the other way when it comes to the whole Elliott Gould situation. It's downright bizarre. It's not like the staff here has never been around a celebrity before. Lee Majors is always doing flips and cartwheels outside the window of the crafts room. And Ted Koppel takes his afternoon tea while breathing fire on the fitness center ceiling practically every other day! To be honest, I think it takes so much work to make this place run as smoothly as it does that most of the employees would rather just ignore Elliott Gould and act like it's not even happening. But the least they could do is log my complaints. I'll be walking down the hall with one of the nurses, and she'll pretend not to hear someone whistling the theme from M*A*S*H on the other side of the men's room door. Then, when I try to drag her inside to witness Elliott Gould and his filthy research firsthand, I'm the one who ends up restrained to a bed for 24 hours, not him. Of course, with the comfy Posturepedic beds at Sunhaven, it hardly feels like restraint at all, and that's what's so frustrating. I often look out my window at the idyllic, leafy courtyard and am reminded of how lucky I am to be a patient in a hospital like this. It's so easy to forget that Sunhaven is even an ""institution""; that's how hard they work to make this place feel like home. And on my best days, as I wake up in my spacious bedroom, bathed in warm, natural light, I can feel all my old anxieties and paranoid fears slipping away—""I can do this,"" I tell myself. ""I'm going to make it."" After all, even if Eliott Gould is in my toilet, the silver men are here, and they're doing their best to make sure everyone cares about your stomach cancer when the devil breathes on you."

Man Dies After Secret 4-Year Battle With Gorilla,10/26/09,3497,"ROANOKE, VA—Local claims adjuster David Seaborne, a devoted husband and father of three, died Tuesday at the age of 37 following a long and painful personal battle with a 512-pound eastern lowland gorilla. According to his wife, Christine—one of the few people who was aware of his courageous struggle—Seaborne chose to fight the muscular, quarter-ton primate in private night after night in hopes of maintaining as normal a life as was possible for his family. “In some ways, I’m relieved that it’s finally over and David can be at peace,” said a tearful Mrs. Seaborne, clutching at a recent photograph of her husband, most of his hair missing after being ripped from his scalp by the rampaging jungle beast. “To watch him seclude himself in that basement every night and know that he was about to be in an unimaginable amount of pain—it just became too much to bear.” “He fought that terrible gorilla with every last ounce of strength he had, but in the end, David’s body just couldn’t handle it anymore,” Mrs. Seaborne added. “Every morning, he’d look at me with tired eyes and deep scratches across his face, and he’d say, ‘Honey, I’m going to beat this thing.’ God, he was brave.” Mrs. Seaborne said she’s used most of her husband’s life insurance payout to start the David Seaborne Foundation, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of those battling gorillas or other great apes. According to the foundation’s website, the growing problem affects one in every 29 million Americans, and one in every 80 Congolese. Although Seaborne never let on to friends or coworkers that he was desperately fighting for his life with a violent primate, many suspected that something was wrong. “I noticed that David had lost a lot of weight over the past couple of months, especially when he came in with his arm torn off,” fellow claims adjuster Kevin Delano said. “He also left work early a lot for doctor’s appointments, or when he was just too weak to make it through the day. Still, with all he was going through, David never complained.” The few people who knew of his hardship said that, even toward the end of his ordeal, when Seaborne was often completely covered in feces, the gorilla never managed to rob him of his dignity. Dr. Earl Patterson, the physician who treated Seaborne throughout his life-or-death battle, initially gave Seaborne just six months to live. Though the prognosis was grim, Patterson said that, with the help of powerful tranquilizers, Seaborne was able to beat back the gorilla several times, and his situation started to look more promising. The gorilla, however, eventually stopped responding to the drugs and returned with a vengeance. “If we had caught this thing earlier, before its growth got completely out of control, David would have had a much better chance of survival,” Patterson said. “But after it reached the silverback stage, it was only a matter of time.” “I tried to make David as comfortable as possible, and even gave him a helmet, but at that point the most we could do was pray,” Patterson added. Patterson said that he has strongly urged Seaborne’s wife to take preventative measures to protect the couple’s three sons, aged 9, 12, and 15, from suffering the same fate as their father. “Because these things tend to run in the family, Jonathan, Patrick, and David Jr. are in a very high risk group,” Patterson said. “Realistically, though, there just isn’t a whole lot that can be done. After all, that gorilla is still in their basement.”"

Obama: Health Care Plan Would Give Seniors Right To Choose How They Are Killed,10/06/09,4546,"WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama held a nationally televised address Tuesday to ""clarify any misunderstandings"" about his health care proposal, assuring Americans that under the new bill senior citizens—and not the federal government—will have the right to choose how they are executed. ""Let me dispel these ridiculous rumors once and for all and set the record straight: Under my plan, seniors are going to be killed the way they want to be killed, end of story,"" said the president, who acknowledged that ""wiping out"" the nation's elderly population has always been his No. 1 priority. ""If your grandmother would rather be euthanized in the privacy of her own home than be gutted and hanged on a high school soccer field, she is entitled to that right."" ""Once again, let me be perfectly clear,"" Obama continued. ""Seniors, rest easy knowing that I will never, under any circumstance, sign a bill that doesn't give you the option of being murdered by my administration in a manner of your choosing. I promise you that."" During his 45-minute address, the president repeatedly stressed his deep and abiding respect for the nation's 65-and-over citizens, saying that murdering them in ways they wouldn't want to be murdered would be both un-American and ""flat-out wrong."" Obama also accused his opponents of using scare tactics to score political points, manipulating seniors' fears with misinformation about their upcoming state-mandated deaths. The president said he sympathized with and related to the fears of older Americans, adding that if a politician told him he could only be killed by being forcibly removed from his home and shot in the street like a dog, but left out the fact that he could also be put down by painless lethal injection, he would be scared, too. ""Folks' concerns over my plan are all based on bogus claims that we intend to set up death panels to kill off senior citizens,"" Obama said. ""Well, that is preposterous. A death panel is only one of many ways we can exterminate the elderly. Under my plan, they can be beaten or poisoned to death. They can be murdered by the Marines or the Air National Guard. They can die fast or they can die slow. They can even be drowned in their own bathtubs."" ""The point is,"" Obama continued, ""there is a way to die in this plan for everyone."" According to the 970-page bill, seniors would have access to more than 600 methods of execution, all of which would be covered by Medicare. The legislation would also allow aging Americans to keep their own primary care physicians if they prefer to be euthanized by their family doctor. The bill also calls for the creation of government-run carbon monoxide poisoning clinics, termination chambers in all YMCA basements, and a new giant pit in the Nevada desert where seniors can be dumped and buried en masse. ""Let the record show, I am opposed to the government getting more involved in people's lives,"" Obama said. ""But in times of great change government has typically stepped in to lend a helping hand. That is why free shuttle buses to school gymnasiums pumped full of sarin gas will be provided for all of our seniors."" Following the speech, White House sources said they expected full party support for the proposal. However, some far-left-leaning Democrats have openly criticized the president for backing down from his initial policy of death panels, arguing that a system offering multiple execution options completely undermines their ideal of a single, universal senior-killing policy. ""The president has watered down a perfectly reasonable plan in hopes of placating the opposition,"" Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) said. ""Look, we started this health care crusade because we believe that death panels are the very best way to eliminate the senior population, and I, for one, stand firm in that belief."" The Republican reaction was even more sternly worded. ""Seniors!"" House minority leader John Boehner (R-OH) said. ""Run for your lives! Obama is coming to kill you! He will kill all of you!"" However, many older Americans lauded the president for finally speaking to them like adults on the matter, and said that for the first time in months they felt they weren't being taken advantage of. ""It was refreshing to feel like I wasn't being used as a pawn to settle one political party's score against another,"" 74-year-old Florida resident Rose Benzio told reporters. ""I didn't agree with everything President Obama had to say, but I think there is probably an option in his plan that will suit me. Decapitation sounds interesting."""

Report: Some Kid's Head Cracked Open In Gym This Morning,9/02/09,3009,"NAPERVILLE, IL—-In an event that everyone at James Madison Junior High is calling really freaking gross, some kid's head got cracked open Wednesday during third-period gym class. The unnamed student, whom eyewitnesses described as some spaz from Mrs. Calloway's homeroom, reportedly attempted to rebound a basketball, lost his balance, and fell backward, slamming his head super-hard against the floor. Although the extent of the injury has not yet been determined, seventh-grade sources said that it was totally gushing blood and would probably need like 400 stitches. ""It was nuts,"" 12-year-old Brian Swanson said. ""He fell straight back."" ""There was tons of blood dripping all over the place,"" added Swanson, who told reporters that the sound of the kid breaking his head on the floor could seriously be heard all the way to the boys' bathroom. A majority of those surveyed believe that blood is still pouring out of the crack in the kid's head. As of press time, it has not been established whether or not the student's parents have been contacted, but many agreed they will flip out when they see their child's head split open like that. Sources reported that gym teacher Mr. Jenkins was majorly pissed when he found out about the accident, telling the whole class to ""shut up and sit down"" when everyone started freaking out. Moreover, numerous kids in the class corroborated allegations that Mr. Jenkins totally swore by saying ""Fuck"" upon seeing the cracked-open head. According to several students who definitely saw the incident happen with their own eyes, Mr. Jenkins had to actually carry the kid to the school nurse, because he was bawling so hard. Others verified early reports that snot was hanging out of the kid's nose from all the crying. The entire class, however, disputed 13-year-old Rick Everson's claim that he himself had cracked his own head open this one time. ""No way,"" said Heather Blake, adding that Everson was such a liar. ""If that happened, you'd either be dead or in the Special Ed classes."" Eighth-graders Brian Grabowski and Tim Steinmetz both provided accounts that several students who witnessed the accident puked everywhere, which they knew because the hallway outside the gymnasium reeked of barf. Expressing regret that he was not in the class at the time, Grabowski told reporters it would have been hilarious to see students blowing chunks all over the place. ""I totally bet you that Stephanie Hulbert was puking,"" Grabowksi said. ""She throws up like every day."" According to Ben Vandenberg's uncle, there was a worse incident 15 years ago, in which an eighth-grader fell while running down the hallway and accidentally stabbed a compass almost totally through his frigging hand. The kid reportedly had to be taken away in an ambulance with the compass still hanging out and everything. During a brief fact-finding mission before fourth period, members of Mrs. Griebe's geography class were unable to prove speculations that the kid's hair had chunks of brain in it."

"I'm Sorry, But There Was Almost Nothing Else We Could Have Done",8/11/09,3446,"Please, sit down. I don't know how to say this, but I'm afraid your father didn't make it. I'm so sorry. I know nothing can make this tragic news easier to hear, but if it's any consolation, we did practically everything we could for him. With a few relatively tiny exceptions, there was nothing else we could have done. Your father—or grandfather, was he? Whatever, anyway, that guy's wounds were extensive. His spleen ruptured en route to the hospital, and his internal bleeding was a real hassle to control. Dr. Juzwiak and I operated for almost three hours, on and off, and although we exhausted a good, I'd say, 75 percent of the options we had, the damage to his heart was simply too severe. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this. But there was only so much that his insurance plan covered. To be fair, we didn't have a very strong chance going in. Sure, there were some radical new procedures we could have tried, but they're really expensive, and you could certainly never have afforded them. Plus, they're extremely complicated and would have taken just hours and hours to perform correctly. Believe me, you have no idea. But I assure you, we did everything we could, within reason, to try and at least make an effort to save your…male relative's life. We opened his chest up, rooted around for what seemed like forever, and tried pretty damn hard to restart his heart. The details are technical, but trust me when I say it was a real mess in there. I washed my hands before and everything. The whole bit. Well, almost the whole bit. I had the general idea, anyway. Given your grandfather's age, overall state of health, limited medical coverage, the fact that it was almost 5 p.m. on a Friday, and that hand cramp I got midway through, the odds were stacked against him. He was in bad shape. Nonetheless, from the moment I woke up from my afternoon nap until the minute we decided to call it a day, Dr. Juzwiak and I gave it the ol' college try—you can be sure of that. He's in a better place now, really. This hospital is terribly overcrowded, there's no AC, and I feel like I see a different sick guy walk in here every 15 minutes. It kind of sucks. Giving news like this is probably one of the hardest parts of my job, which is why I generally make my interns to it. I can see the pain in your faces. I know you're angry; I'm angry, too. I just wasted three hours of my life on a long-shot patient and I come all the way down here only to discover that the damn vending machine's out of Sprite Zero again. Hopefully, in time, you and your family will find some solace in the fact that we gave it a good, solid go. I mean, we didn't get carried away or anything, but we definitely did a majority of the things we could have done for your father at the end there. Think of it this way: Even if we had saved him, he was pretty old to begin with, so he probably would have died of something before too much longer, whether we killed ourselves operating on him or not. All we can do now is pray that the insurance company agrees to pay for what we did manage to do for him. Please…don't feel the need to say anything now. You've just had a terrible shock. The death of a loved one is never easy. Right now, the best thing for you to do is go down to the accounts department, fill out and sign a bunch of forms, write a few checks, thank us for all our hard work, and then go home and get some rest. I'm very nearly sorry for your loss."

"So This Is A Panic Attack, Eh?",7/30/09,4582,"Hmmm. Something seems to be happening. I'm definitely noticing a quickening of the breath, a pounding of the heart, racing thoughts, and I believe…yes, the feeling of an elephant sitting on my chest. If I didn't know any better, I'd say this is one of those elusive ""panic attacks"" I've heard so much about. Huh. I really didn't expect it to be quite so utterly terrifying. Weird. It's almost as if the more I think about how panicked I am, the more panicked I get. Like some kind of, what do you call those? Vicious circles. Like I'm spiraling around in an state of utter helplessness, unable to function on even the most basic level. Yeah, that about sums it up. I'd like to try to calm myself down by drinking a glass of water, but—it's really the darnedest thing—the kitchen sink feels 400 miles away, and the thought of actually getting up to go over there feels about as impossible as flapping my arms and flying to the moon. Man, these panic attack things really are as petrifying as they look in the movies! Now, granted, I'm new at this, but I can't help but notice that there doesn't appear to be any concrete reason for me to feel so terrible. How odd. I guess I assumed that such a sudden, paralyzing wave of unbearable dread like this would follow an actual occurrence of some sort. Like, say, my girlfriend leaving me. Oh my God, what if my girlfriend leaves me? Perhaps if I think about it for a moment longer, I can come up with all kinds of specific reasons to feel this terrible. Oh, yep, here they come. Here they come. Loneliness, getting fired from job, alienation by social circle, blood clots in legs, my dog hates me, plane crashes, cancer. Gee, these panic attacks are powerful stuff, aren't they? They weren't kidding! I can't quite put my finger on the total sensation of unavoidable doom that's coursing through my body like a tidal wave. But if I had to describe it, I'd probably go with ""all-consuming."" Yeah, definitely all-consuming. Everything in my field of vision seems to contain malevolent, menacing forces bent on my destruction, which is a bit of a surprise considering they're just inanimate objects in my living room. Lamps, end tables, rugs…who knew they could be so horrifying, in a nonspecific sort of way? Aaaand, now I'm sweating. Oh, my stars and garters, isn't this wild? I wonder what's going to happen next. If I weren't stuck in the fetal position, I'd be on the edge of my seat with anticipation. Going by what my brain has been telling me repeatedly for the past 20 minutes, I'd predict that I'm about to die. Probably a heart attack. Or stroke. Or brain aneurysm, diabetic shock, spontaneous lung collapse, or…can you panic to death? My, my, what amazingly rapid thoughts I'm having. Maybe if I repeat some simple phrase to myself over and over maniacally, that'll calm me down. It's worth a try, right? You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. Nope. Turns out the only sounds I am capable of making right now are strangled gurgling noises and quiet sobs. Oh, wait. I seem to be calming down a bit. Yes. Things are coming back into focus and I can feel my heart slowing. All right. Settle down. Breathe slow. Someday I'm going to die. Oh, God, it's back. Here we go. I had better call 9-1-1 and have an ambulance come pick me up. Then they can take me to the hospital and complete a barrage of tests that will all come back negative, and the doctors will tell me there's nothing wrong with me physically, and they'll chastise me for wasting their time and valuable hospital resources, and the bill will be outrageously high, and I won't be able to pay it, and I'll be right back here in this whirling vortex of unrelenting horror and fear. Oh, my goodness gracious. How long do these things last? Perhaps hiding under the covers in my bed will help. Let's see now…no, nope. Still just as panicky under there as I was curled up in a ball on the couch. This panic attack sure is persistent. Looks like it's going to follow me wherever I go. In fact, come to think of it, nothing can help me at all. Alternately hugging the couch pillows and throwing them across the room doesn't seem to have any effect. Sobbing with big fat tears running down my face isn't doing any good either. The worse things get, the more I panic, and the more I panic, the worse things get. Who knew that, all this time, when people were talking about a panic attack, what they really meant was a nonstop rocket-sled ride to hell itself, where your soul gets sucked through a straw by demons? Well, at least I finally understand what all the hubbub is about."

Swine Flu Season Is Really Flu-ing By!,5/21/09,4113,"Paging Dr. Dudek! Paging Dr. Dudek! You're wanted in the OR to perform an MRI and EKG on REO Speedwagon ASAP! A-OK? Don't be afraid, my loyal readers. I haven't left the humor-writing biz for the medical profession. (Sure, I have been known to cut folks up and split a few sides…but I've never reached in there and pulled out a kidney!) I'm just getting in the spirit of the season—flu season, that is. That magical time of year when your nose does the running…and you stay in bed! And boy was this year a doozy! (Or should I say flu-zy?) Last month, the twins caught a nasty case of the influenza, which, as I soon discovered, is not the name of a lovely Spanish girl. They started sneezing and sniffling and coughing and aching and Dopey and Doc and Bashful and all the rest. I took one look at their red noses and watery eyes and knew they had caught the train—the flu-sTrain (flu strain)! Whoo, whoo! All aboard! Making all stops to Chi-cough-go, Feverdelphia, New York Snotty, and Germany! Figures. I spend the last 12 years trying to teach my girls how to share things, and the first time they do, it's an infectious disease! Why do I even bother? Now, call me old-fashioned—or better yet, send a telegram!—but I think these kinds of colds are best handled with a cup of warm soup, a good night's sleep, and enough cough syrup to take down a yak. But my wife, Rosemary, has spent the last three months sleeping in the den and watching cable news until the wee hours of the morning, and according to her, the only remedy for the flu is a heaping tablespoon of panic. Apparently (and I am not making this up) there's been an outbreak of something called swine flu, and Rosemary was convinced our girls had caught it. I asked her, ""How could the twins have gotten the swine flu? They're vegetarians!"" The last time I was allowed to bring bacon into this house was when the wife and I rented Footloose. I told her the only way I'd get some pork is if I knew someone in Congress. Hey, does swine flu come with a side of barbecue sauce? Because if so, count me in! Of course, Rosemary always just sighs and leaves the room when I'm being a ham. Turns out this ""Porky Pigfluenza"" is spreading faster than Sharon Stone's legs, so my wife decided it would be a good idea to take the girls to the doctor. Seems she thinks we have too much money lying around the house, and only a medical professional can cure that! Oh, my aching wallet. These doctors, I tell you. They're either crooks, or quacks, or both. Their motto is, ""You think you're sick now? Wait until you get the bill!"" It ended up costing me $218 to spend an hour in the waiting room and six minutes with the doctor. Can you believe it? Last time I spent that much time and money to see one guy, he was onstage playing with Stills and Nash. Hey, Doc, maybe while you're checking the girls for signs of curly tails, you can tell me how it's possible that my kids get the swine flu and I'm the one who ends up wallowing. Well, you can stick an apple in my mouth, rotate me on a spit, and serve me at a luau, because I am cooked. Let's just hope this whole mess is covered by my oink-surance (insurance)! Don't worry. We'll be back for another checkup…when pigs flu! Of course, the girls just had regular flu, not swine flu. (They probably built up immunity from years of keeping their room like a pigsty!) But before everyone loses their heads—or their snouts—about this e-pork-demic, let me ask you this: Has anyone tried reasoning with the swine flu? Maybe we could talk some sense into it. Just remember to speak its language: pig latin! Ey-hay, ine-sway u-flay! Y-whay on't-day ou-yay ick-pay on-way omeone-say our-yay own-way ize-say? Icroscopic-may!

Renowned Hoo-Ha Doctor Wins Nobel Prize For Medical Advancements Down There,3/30/09,3263,"STOCKHOLM—In recognition of her groundbreaking work treating life- threatening diseases of the privates, renowned hoo-ha specialist Dr. Victoria Lazoff was awarded the Nobel Prize in Lady Medicine this week. The world's foremost authority on ailments down south, Lazoff led a team of cutting-edge hoo-ha doctors to develop new strategies for detecting abnormal growth in…you know, that area. The accomplished physician humbly accepted medicine's highest honor before a crowd of her peers, and spoke about the importance of regular screenings to prevent unnecessary complications up inside one's business. ""Recent advancements have brought us closer than ever to eliminating this threat, but early detection is still our best defense,"" said Dr. Lazoff, who earned a doctorate in lady parts from Johns Hopkins University. ""I thank you all for this great honor, which I hope will finally bring the world's attention to the serious matter of [hoo-ha] disease."" Attendees said Lazoff then presented a number of slides pertaining to the, uh, nether-type zone. This marks the first time in more than 20 years that a Nobel Prize has been given to a physician who specializes in all that stuff downstairs. Committee members praised Lazoff for helping to stem the frightening epidemic, which last year killed more women than ta-ta and derriere cancer combined. In many cases, Lazoff's methods have been able to prevent the spread of malignant cells from the inside of the um, geez, to the…more inside of…you know, the part that's sort of, uh….God, is it getting hot in here? During the remarkably noninvasive procedure, targeted blasts of radiation are delivered to the, err, naughty region through a special, well, wand-like device that is—ahem—inserted near the, ho boy, ""affected area."" You get the picture. The treatment was also found to eliminate fibrous growths without causing nerve damage to the surrounding bits, the inside stuff, and that other thing that looks kind of like a rubber hoop. For these reasons, Lazoff's work has been heralded by many in her field as ""invaluable"" to modern medicine. ""Dr. Lazoff is a brilliant and dedicated physician who has saved countless lives with her research, and I can think of no one more deserving of this award,"" said noted pediatric oncologist Dr. Harold Brimson. ""How many do you think she sees in a day? Must be a ton."" Accompanying the Nobel Prize is a $1.4 million grant that, according to medical experts, can buy Lazoff a lot of those metal spreader thingies. But the talented physician told reporters she is not interested in monetary reward, and only hopes to educate at-risk women about their own vag—genit—about their health. ""We should be encouraging an open dialogue with our young women, one that isn't constrained by some outdated facade of 1950s morality,"" Lazoff said to a crowd of people looking down at their shoes. ""I cannot say this clearly enough: Ladies, please, make an appointment to get your annual [looksie-doo], especially if you are [seeing a fella] or have experienced pain or sensitivity in your ['Hello, my baby! Hello, my darling! Hello, my ragtime gal!']."" Added Lazoff, ""It is time for this country to begin having a frank discussion about the [sound of loud, extended train whistle]."""
FDA Approves Salmonella,3/10/09,3641,"WASHINGTON—Calling it ""perfectly safe for the most part,"" and ""not nearly as destructive or fatal as previously thought,"" the Food and Drug Administration approved the enterobacteria salmonella for human consumption this week. The federal agency, which has struggled in recent years to contain the food-borne pathogen, and repeatedly failed to prevent tainted products from reaching store shelves, announced Monday that salmonella was now completely okay for all Americans to enjoy. ""Rigorous testing has shown that salmonella is…fine,"" FDA director of food safety Stephen Sundlof said. ""In fact, our research indicates that there's no need to pull any more foodstuffs from the market. Not raw chicken. Not contaminated spinach. Not thousands of jars of harmful peanut butter. Not anything."" ""It's approved,"" Sundlof continued.""Healthy, delicious salmonella is finally approved."" Following the announcement, the FDA released a 20-page report, which included evidence that salmonella is barely more dangerous than other live-culture products such as yogurt, and results from a clinical trial which found that participants who ingested salmonella were totally fine for up to three minutes. The report also concluded that salmonella has been around American kitchens for centuries now, and must therefore be at least harmless, if not actually good for us. ""Of course, as with everything, we encourage moderation,"" lead FDA researcher Phillip Millar said. ""Don't just eat a whole pint of salmonella in one sitting. It's like ice cream or, for example, E. coli in that respect."" Added Millar, ""A little bit goes a long way."" According to FDA officials, the intracellular bacterium will be commercially available in a variety of forms. Plans are already in the works to offer salmonella as a flavorful topping, food spread, powdered drink mix, dessert gelatin, and as a ""no frills"" yellow liquid guaranteed to enhance one's overall eating experience. With hundreds of possible applications, the newly approved gram-negative microbe will also open the door for many innovative and exciting products. ""This is thrilling news,"" Hellmann's CEO Robert Reichert said. ""We've been waiting for the federal go-ahead to produce salmonella for decades now. In fact, we have an entire line of lukewarm, sun-soaked, and partially turned mayonnaises that we just know Americans will love."" One of several new foods to feature the motile microorganism is Salmonell-Os—an O-shaped breakfast cereal packed with hearty typhoid clusters—which is expected to hit grocery stores by April. Other products currently in development include Salmonella Helper, Kraft's Extremely Painful Mac, 'Nella Wafers, and peanut butter. ""Now that salmonella's been approved, we're working overtime to get our products to market,"" said David Wellbrook, head of sales for Oscar Mayer, the nation's leading producer of bologna-based goods. ""I've never seen so many orders come through in a single year, much less a single day. It's incredible."" News of salmonella's approval also comes as a relief to many homemakers, who, until now, had been cautioned against letting the bacteria spread. ""It used to be such a pain to have to sanitize my kitchen,"" Chicago resident Margaret Thewles said. ""Now all I need is one cutting board. I'll cut raw poultry on it, prepare my salad veggies on it, and then use it to serve dessert when I'm done."" Michael Weinback, a California native and father of two young children, agreed with Thewles. ""This is…arrghhh…great,"" Weinback said from the bottom of his living room stairs. ""Oh, Jesus…here it comes agai—uuuuhhhhh, Christ. Get hel…just get…aarrghh."""

""If our projections are correct and current trends in rough, dry sex continue, we'll see a spike in sales starting in mid-January,"" Ocean Spray CEO Randy Papdellis said during a press conference.

""Because I'm in a good mood today, and because I like your face, I'll let this baby go for only $20,"" said Jenkins, referring to the ambiguous object, which lacked even the most basic of defining traits, and appeared to serve no discernible purpose, decorative or otherwise. ""All right then—$15, but I can't go any lower than that. After all, you don't see very many of these around anymore."" Jenkins added that if you take the impossible to determine item off his hands, he'd throw in a second one for your car."
"New Pain-Inducing Advil Created For People Who Just Want To Feel Something, Anything",11/21/08,3110,"PHILADELPHIA—Wyeth Pharmaceuticals unveiled a new pain-causing line of Advil this week that will help millions of benumbed, hollow consumers to feel at least somewhat alive for up to four hours. ""Advil Release delivers a soothing burst of pain when cold and listless Americans need it most,"" Wyeth CEO Bernard J. Poussot said during a press conference Monday. ""Just two capsules can deliver all-day relief in the form of searing, life-affirming agony; the kind of agony Advil users trust when being a pale specter of humanity adrift in a meaningless and uncaring universe is just not an option anymore."" According to Poussot, the new drug works by delivering a powerful stimulant straight to the brain's pain center, causing an intense stinging sensation all over the body. If taken regularly, the deadening futility of day-to-day life will be temporarily washed away in a flood of blessed and cleansing torment. ""Two fast-acting, long-lasting Advil Release taken three times a day are recommended for anyone who is convinced he or she will never laugh or cry again,"" Poussot said. ""Teenagers who see no difference between being dead or alive, nor why it makes a difference either way, may require twice the suggested dosage."" Continued Poussot, ""Those wishing to never again suffer through another numb, flat day devoid of even the basic components of humanness are advised to take an entire bottle of Advil Release along with a quart of gin."" A nationwide advertising campaign for the new medication is slated to begin next week. In the first of two 30-second TV spots, a woman is shown walking outside on a winter's day and coming upon a puppy that has frozen to death. As she stares unblinkingly at the small, frail carcass, a disembodied announcer tells viewers: ""Don't spend another day unable to shed a single tear for the eternal tragedy that is existence. Embrace the pain. Advil pain. It's the only thing that's real."" Public reaction to the new medication has been generally positive. Millions of emotionally dulled people across the nation have scrambled for the opportunity, any opportunity, to temporarily escape from mechanically lurching through unfeeling day after unfeeling day after unfeeling day after unfeeling day. ""This new Advil has really—oh, God, the sublime suffering,"" said 27-year-old copy center employee Nathan Tillson of Roanoke, VA, tears welling up in his eyes. ""Sweet Jesus, I haven't closed off. I can still feel."" ""Gah,"" Tillson added before doubling over on the floor and openly sobbing for the first time in as long as he could remember. Other pharmaceutical companies have also begun marketing their own brands of over- the-counter medications that will help the emotionally anesthetized feel briefly alive. The makers of NyQuil are reportedly developing a new product they describe as ""the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, aching, screaming, crying, writhing, so you can possibly—for the love of God—experience some sense of normalcy medicine,"" and Johnson & Johnson recently released a new line of Tylenol Maximum Suffering, the active ingredient of which is thumbtacks."
Blistex Executive Makes Fool Of Himself At Lip-Balm Conference,11/15/08,3520,"SCOTTSDALE, AZ—While attending the lip-balm industry's largest annual conference, Blistex marketing executive Bernard Ganley committed a number of embarrassing social gaffes, breached several codes of conduct, and generally acted in a manner unbefitting a major lip-balm company representative, sources reported Thursday. Ganley, who was sent to the four-day conference to launch Blistex's new lip moisturizer, first humiliated himself Monday morning when he failed to remember what the signature product was called. By the end of the week, the 62-year-old executive had made a dozen more blunders, including walking straight past an important regional wholesaler, stumbling over basic industry terminology, and suggesting that applicator tips were a ""thing of the past."" ""Bernard should have been honored to be part of such an esteemed event, but instead he makes a complete ass of himself,"" said conference attendee Donald L. Porter. ""To say the things he did in front of ChapStick CEO Russell Morton, whose grandfather single-handedly built the lip-soothing industry—it's an atrocity."" ""Asking if ChapStick ever tried adding mint to its medicated formula,"" Porter continued. ""Is he out of his godforsaken mind?"" The national symposium, which took place at the Scottsdale Resort and Conference Center, was reportedly almost ruined by Ganley on a number of occasions. According to sources, the thoughtless executive threw away free samples right in front of vendors, asked horrified onlookers the difference between salve and balm, and alienated several Carmex distributors when he noted that the company was still using those ""little white jars."" Many claimed the all-natural lip-care company Burt's Bees received the worst of Granley's insensitive remarks. Granley failed to recognize Burt's Bees CEO John Replogle and then overlooked the senior executive's outstretched hand after it was determined that the two of them had met several times before. In addition, Granley offended Replogle when he told him that Burt's Bees' products tasted a lot better than he remembered. ""I understand that Blistex is one of the top three lip-balm manufacturers in the country, but who does he think he is acting so dismissive?"" said Kiss My Face CFO Crystal Ward. ""Burt's Bees is established now. You don't just brush them off. And you definitely don't go up to that table and not talk to Harriet."" ""Jesus Christ,"" Ward continued. ""You just don't do that."" Granley's competitors were not the only ones to feel the brunt of his inappropriate behavior. On Tuesday, the Blistex executive drew the scorn of his own company after incorrectly referring to its new sheer moisturizing solution as ""ointment,"" and was nearly fired on the spot later that same day after suggesting that Blistex's flagship cherry flavor be discontinued—a move many called ""unthinkable and highly offensive."" ""You can't attack cherry flavor and expect to get away with it,"" said vice president of Blistex business development Steve Mundle. ""This will get back to corporate, it'll get out to people. Heads are going to roll."" ""This was supposed to be a breakthrough year for Blistex; we were supposed to be celebrating,"" Mundle added. ""Instead. one loose cannon had to destroy everything we worked so hard to build."" Granley reportedly made his worst faux pas on the final night of the symposium, when he invited conventioneers up to his suite for the annual cocaine orgy, only to stand naked in front of the entire room and ask if anyone had brought Vaseline."
Coworker Has That Excuse That's Going Around,11/11/08,656,"ANN ARBOR, MI—Digital Copy Shoppe employee Don Newson, 38, called in to work on Wednesday complaining that he was certain he had come down with the 24-hour excuse that has been going around. ""My back is killing me, I feel stuffed up, and I have this pounding headache,"" said Newson, citing the initial symptoms of the excuse, which often afflicts those who are already late for work. ""It sucks, because I want to come in, but I don't want anyone else to catch what I've got. I should be fine after sleeping for a couple days."" Newson has placed himself on a strict regimen of watching the past six episodes of Entourage on HBO on Demand to cure the excuse."
Majority Of Americans Never Use Physical Education After High School,11/10/08,3790,"CEDAR RAPIDS, IA—Kevin Higgins always hated gym class. Like many of his classmates, he questioned the relevance of things like ""exercise"" and ""physical fitness,"" and wondered if these skills would ever provide any practical, real-world benefits. Though he endured more than 720 hours of gym over 12 years, the 32-year-old accounting clerk said Monday that he has still never used physical education once in his life. ""I don't know why they bothered teaching us all that stuff,"" said Higgins, who since graduating has not once encountered a situation that required him to move his body at a sustained pace or keep himself in healthy shape. ""I mean, come on—when will I ever need to physically exert myself for an extended period of time?"" Higgins is not alone. According to a recent poll, nearly 85 percent of all Americans admitted that, since entering the real world, they have found very few reasons to utilize the concepts they learned in physical education. In fact, most high school graduates claim that despite their gym teachers' insistence that this knowledge would come in handy later in life, they have still never used bending, breaking a sweat, or coordination. ""I remember my gym teacher droning on and on about this thing called 'physical well-being,'"" Higgins said. ""I still don't even know what that means."" Many educators and high-ranking health officials maintain that it is essential for young adults to learn such valuable skills as participating in activities and interacting with peers, increasing the intake of oxygen and nutrients to the blood, going out of doors, and moving. However, thousands of Americans have nonetheless gone on to lead very successful lives without ever bringing their heart rate over 120 beats per minute. Erica Burnstrom, a 28-year-old aeronautics engineer living in San Jose, CA, said that abstract concepts such as aerobic activity and raising one's knees above the hips in a rapid ""pumping"" motion have not added any appreciable value to her day-to-day life. ""I never use any of that stuff, like walking quickly for five minutes,"" said Burnstrom, who paused from using the Pythagorean identity to solve for the cosine of 71° and 144° in order to speak to reporters. ""I understand that my phys-ed teacher needed to know all that stuff because that was his job, but I'm not some specialist who needs to lie flat, lift her torso into a sitting position, and then return to the original position for a living."" ""I wish they'd have taught us useful things in gym, like sitting at a computer and ordering things,"" Burnstrom added. Many Americans claimed that once they finished high school, skills such as increasing joint mobility and building muscle strength were no longer necessary. ""If something needs to get from one place to another, I can just use my cell phone, or hop in the car. And I know they say that physical education promotes balance, but that's what my cane is for,"" said Miami, FL resident Keith Monahan, 32. ""The only thing I still use from gym class is that occasionally I'll throw on some sweatpants while I'm sitting on the couch watching television. So I guess I learned that."" Omaha insurance salesman William Haylor, 43, said that when his 8-year-old son asked him how to do a chin-up, he realized that he had simply forgotten. ""I know I used to be able to do that, but for the life of me I can't remember,"" Haylor said. ""They're really hard to do. I think that's why I stopped."" ""I wish I could help him out,"" Haylor added. ""But what's the point? He's never going to use it anyway."" In response to these findings, many Americans have urged the government to stop wasting millions of dollars on useless physical education programs and start focusing on real problems, such as obesity, arthritis, and chronic back pain."

Burned Lower Half Of Mort's Face Revealed In 'Bazooka Joe' Stunner,11/01/08,4480,"NEW YORK—The world of bubblegum- related comics was forever changed Monday, when, after more than 50 years, the Bazooka Joe supporting character known as ""Mort"" finally revealed the lower half of his face to be a grotesque mask of third-degree burns. The eye-opening strip, unveiled earlier this week by the Topps Company, is being called the darkest, most compelling installment in the entire Bazooka Joe series. In the strip, a wisecracking Mort pulls down his trademark red turtleneck and, for the first time, exposes millions of readers to the jumbled mass of flesh and bone that lies beneath it. ""Readers will never look at Mort or, for that matter, any of the other Bazooka Joe characters the same way again,"" said noted bubblegum-art historian and author Phillip Weissenthal. ""This changes everything—Mort's relationship with Jane, the time he and Bazooka Joe went to the zoo together, his fervent dislike of Metaldude. It's a paradigmatic shift on a scale never before seen in bubblegum literature."" ""That face,"" Weissenthal continued. ""God, that scarred and blistered face."" According to sources at Topps, the shocking revelation represents five decades of careful planning on the part of the strip's many artists. Though initially concerned about unveiling Mort's scorched and deformed face to the public, all agreed that the time had come to show what had remained covered all these years. ""This was perhaps not what people expected from Bazooka Joe,"" said the strip's current art director Anthony Sheppard. ""It may not be pretty and it may not be easy to swallow, but it's the truth. This is Bazooka Joe. This is two square inches of real life."" Created in 1953 by World War II veterans Woody Gelman and Wesley Morse, Bazooka Joe was reportedly started as a way for its two creators to deal with the horrors they had witnessed while fighting overseas. ""Bazooka Joe has always been about mankind's search for meaning in a world marked by pain,"" said staff artist Martin Shore, who claimed that the idea for Mort first came to Gelman after he watched entire villages burn to the ground in the Philippines. ""Sure, the sight of Mort's charred and blackened jaw may shock some of our readers, but maybe they should be shocked. Maybe it's time they woke up and realized the true, unrelenting nightmare that is our very existence."" Added Shore, ""If they don't like it, they can buy another fruit-flavored gum."" A number of Bazooka Joe writers, some of whom have been with the comic since its inception, said that Gelman and Morse would be proud of the controversial strip were they still alive today. According to veteran gag-writer Henry Paluschi, the latest Bazooka Joe strip is a living testament to the spirit of the bubblegum comic. ""Why do you think it's called Bazooka Joe?"" said Paluschi, explaining that Morse named the strip in honor of Pvt. Joseph Weinek, who was blinded in his right eye by a surprise bazooka attack shortly before U.S. forces were overrun in the Battle of Mindanao. ""All this time—haven't you ever wondered what's beneath Bazooka's eyepatch?"" Paluschi continued. ""Well, I'll tell you. It's nothing. Nothing at all—just an empty, gaping mass of pus and scar tissue. A gaping hole, one as dark and bare and devoid of all hope as the future we face."" Though some have called the controversial comic strip ""inappropriate for the majority of its intended audience,"" others have praised the strip, heralding it as a profoundly moving and inspirational artistic risk. ""Seeing Mort reveal the source of his inner demons is what finally gave me the courage to stop pulling my own turtleneck over my face,"" said Ted Hyams, a cancer survivor who lost his lower jaw to the devastating disease. ""He is a symbol of that which enables us, at our best, to transcend man's inhumanity to man."" ""And also, you can win prizes, like a fun Bazooka Joe bobblehead figure, if you collect enough strips and mail them in,"" he added. Hyams' support is reflected by many within the creative world who have been affected by Bazooka Joe over the years. ""There are those who may be angered by the frankly disturbing imagery the Bazooka Joe comic strip is choosing to present,"" said Art Spiegelman, a Pulitzer Prize–winning artist and former Topps employee. ""But it's the job of all true art to challenge and subvert the assumptions of its audience, and to confront them with the brutal realities they may not otherwise want to see."" ""Hehe,"" Spiegelman continued. ""Face facts."""
Plastic Surgeon General Warns Of Small Breasts Epidemic,10/20/08,5394,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA—According to a report released Monday by U.S. plastic surgeon general Dr. Louis T. Saddler, an alarming number of American women are suffering from dangerously small breasts. The Office of the Plastic Surgeon General—headed by a presidential appointee tasked with monitoring the national aesthetic, alerting the public to any small flaws, and offering a wide range of affordable, noninvasive laser resurfacing options—first addressed the countrywide plague of undersized breasts in the mid-1980s by demanding that manufacturers of A- through C-cup bras place large warning labels on their products informing female consumers of the potential risk of having deficient bosoms. Since taking the position in 2001, Dr. Saddler has continued these education efforts, launching several ad campaigns and personally reaching out to women all across the nation. ""The undersized breasts problem in the United States has reached crisis level,"" Saddler said during a press conference held at the National Centers for Rhinoplasty and Microdermabrasion. ""Unless they receive immediate cosmetic treatment, millions of women in this country will lose the attention of their male acquaintances completely, and some may never be able to land husbands or, if they are somehow already married, keep their husbands' interest."" Added Saddler, ""I urge all Americans to educate themselves about the differences between silicone and saline, and contact my secretary Linda to set something up."" According to information found on the plastic surgeon general's website, there are several easily identifiable indications that a woman may be afflicted with Chronic Breast Deficiency, or CBD. These include the inability to fill out tight sweaters, as well as invisibility when in proximity to women who have large breasts. Females with this disorder may also experience a troubling absence of back pain. Despite impressive advances in augmentation mammoplasty in recent years, breast smallness continues to be a scourge on the female population, in some part due to the difficulty many women have in recognizing the symptoms. According to Saddler, some can live with a severe chest deficiency for years without realizing that they have a problem. ""A woman who suspects that she may have this condition can verify it with an extremely quick, normally painless test,"" said Saddler, later adding that symptoms such as a fluid, natural movement of the bosom or any breast shape other than a perfectly round, rock-hard grapefruit should also serve as definitive warning signs. ""It's as simple as consulting a trained professional such as a strip-club bouncer or licensed drywaller to assess your personal risk."" ""I cannot stress enough how important it is for women who believe they already have large breasts to remember that they can almost always benefit from having even larger breasts,"" Saddler added. Citing statistics showing that small breasts strike women of every age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, and that every region of the United States is uniformly affected with the exception of Southern California, the plastic surgeon general stressed that a nation of under-breasted women is ""everyone's problem."" In an attempt to reach out to as many citizens as possible, including those not directly afflicted, the Office of the Plastic Surgeon General has released a series of public service announcements that emphasize the important role men can play in helping to turn the tide of the epidemic. ""If your daughter, girlfriend, or secretary has small breasts, let her know that she should get the help she needs,"" Saddler says in one of the televised spots, standing before a diagram of Pamela Anderson. ""Referring to under- endowed women's mammaries as 'mosquito bites' or likening a female's appearance to a diving board are just two of the many effective methods that can encourage those suffering from this unpleasant disorder to seek treatment."" The informative PSA also suggests several coping strategies that can allow small-breasted women to lead a relatively productive life while securing the funds necessary to have their disorder remedied. These include giggling at anything a man says, wearing shorter skirts, and engaging in empty promiscuity. Although the plastic surgeon general's office has had a long-standing and fruitful partnership with the media to promote the image of a healthy, ample-chested lifestyle, Saddler said legislation may be the key to solving this crisis. Last week, Congress proposed a bill that would earmark $600 million to provide high schools nationwide with educational programs and literature. ""The younger a woman is when she realizes that she has this problem, the better off we'll all be,"" said Sen. Wayne Allard (R-CO), head of the recently formed Itty-Bitty Titty Senate Subcommittee. ""Of course, we support all women receiving treatment for this disorder, regardless of how old they are."" ""But after they hit 45 or so, really, what's the point?"" added Allard, referring to a condition known as aging, which is cited by the plastic surgeon general as another worrisome but treatable issue currently affecting 100 percent of American women. Several studies have found that the dreaded aging syndrome also affects men, but, in those cases, is known alternatively as ""dignification"" and is generally considered to be an asset rather than an impairment."
Area Man Pretty Sure It's Not Broken,10/01/08,500,"YOUNGSTOWN, OH—Despite coming down on it pretty hard, area man Doug Grissett maintained his position Thursday that it is not broken. ""I didn't hear a pop,"" said Grissett, claiming that it only hurts a little when you push it right here. Grissett also confirmed that he can move it like this, and like this, but when he tries to move it like this, ah fuck. He added, ""This happened once last August, the same thing. It's probably nothing."" At press time, it has swelled up to the size of a cantaloupe."
Another Disgusting Operation Proves John McCain Is Healthy,9/23/08,904,"SCOTTSDALE, AZ—In an act designed to completely reassure voters about his health, presidential candidate John McCain checked himself into the Mayo Clinic yesterday, where he successfully completed another unbearably bloody, invasive, and most foul operation. ""Sen. McCain's enterocutaneous fistula was treated swiftly and without incident, "" said Dr. Michael Yardley, standing before the press covered in the 72-year-old's blood and fecal matter. ""After we breached the abdominal wall to take numerous tissue samples from his small intestine, it was clear the senator was in perfect health for his age. A few more simple blood and mucus tests too horrifying to discuss here and the senator will be fit as a fiddle."" Next month, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will manually disimpact stool from McCain's fetid rectum in what is expected to be a painless procedure for the spry and virile Arizona senator."
Man Succumbs To 7-Year Battle With Health Insurance,9/22/08,3722,"DENVER—After years of battling crippling premiums and agonizing deductibles, local resident Michael Haige finally succumbed this week to the health insurance policy that had ravaged his adult life. Haige, who had suffered from limited medical coverage for nearly a decade, passed away early Monday morning. According to sources, the 46-year-old was laid to rest at Fairplains cemetery, surrounded by friends, family members, and more than $300,000 of mounting debt. ""I miss Michael every single day, but at least he can finally rest now,"" said Sheila Haige, who watched as insurance rates ate away at her husband over time. ""What Michael went through, the humiliating forms, the invasive background checks, the complete loss of dignity and hope—I wouldn't wish that kind of torture on anyone."" Once a healthy and happy father of two, Haige saw his life forever change seven years ago when health insurance professionals diagnosed him with a preexisting condition. As months passed and his line of credit continued to deteriorate, the former high school football coach would experience excruciating headaches and bouts of nausea every time another hospital bill arrived. ""My dad always seemed invincible, like there was nothing in the world that could hurt him,"" son Ryan Haige said. ""But then, one night, I found him bent over a stack of UB-92 and HCFA forms, and he was crying. I'd never seen my father look so scared in all my life."" Added Ryan, ""Making those payments each month—it was killing him."" While family members refused to look at Haige's insurance plan as a death sentence, it soon became clear that their loved one was facing the biggest fight of his life. Countless visits to doctors, claims adjusters, and loan officers proved futile, with Haige being told at every turn that his case was hopeless. ""They said there was nothing they could do for him, that modern medicine was powerless against this monster,"" Sheila Haige said. ""Still, Michael never gave up. He kept saying that he was going to beat the odds, that he was going to find some way to get coverage."" According to an independent study released last month by the Mayo Clinic, health insurance is the nation's No. 2 cause of death, claiming the lives of some 400,000 Americans each year. A silent killer, health insurance often strikes without warning, its harmful and profit-based policies avoiding detection until it is far too late. Although the cruel bureaucratic disorder does not discriminate, statistics have shown that senior citizens, young dependents, and those woefully underemployed are most at risk. ""I can't tell you the number of patients I've had to deliver the bad news to over the years,"" said Haige's longtime family physician, Dr. Howard Silverman. ""It's never easy to look someone in the eye and tell them it's going to have to be out-of-pocket. For most of these poor people, prayer is the only hope."" Toward the end of Haige's seven-year ordeal, family members said, the once loving husband and father had become an empty husk of his former self. ""I remember the last thing he ever said to me,"" said eldest son Mark Haige, holding a small picture of his father during happier times, before the endless battery of co-pays began. ""He took my hand in his, and he said, 'Son, promise me you'll never sign up for a high-deductible, network-model HMO.'"" While still angry and in shock over Michael's premature passing, Sheila and her two children say the whole experience has taught them the importance of family. ""If Dad were still with us, I know he would want us to be here, at home, supporting Mom,"" Mark Haige said. ""She really hasn't been doing so well ever since Bankers Life and Casualty denied her life insurance claim."""

CDC Powerless To Stop Spread Of Virulent Mayonnaise-Borne Pathogen,8/18/08,5091,"ATLANTA—Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday that despite continued efforts to halt the multistate outbreak of an intensely noxious, mayonnaise-borne virus, they have been unable to combat its deadly progress. The first known case of the viral strain, which thrives in the delicious, creamy environment of mixed egg yolks, vegetable oil, and vinegar, was recorded by the CDC just three weeks ago and may be the strongest and most infectious contagion ever detected in mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-related substance. The agency’s leading scientists have determined the epicenter of the growing pandemic to be an infected roast beef sandwich in the St. Charles suburb of Chicago. Despite the best efforts of the CDC, an estimated 40 million Americans have already been affected by what the media has dubbed the “White Plague.” “We have identified the popular condiment mayonnaise as the sole carrier of this highly contagious and deadly viral strain,” said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the CDC. “There is no known cure, and for now, all citizens must seriously examine their mayo-eating habits in order to avoid contracting the disease. Maybe you could try eating your turkey club with mustard, or perhaps a small helping of relish.” “Most importantly, do not panic,” Gerberding continued. “We assure you that normal mayonnaise consumption will resume as soon as we clear the dead and contain this lethal pathogen.” According to information released by the CDC to all major television and radio stations, ingestion of the mayonnaise-borne virus results in shooting body pains, headaches, fevers, internal bleeding, abnormal gait, loss of muscle control, dementia, and, in its final stages, a slight decrease in one’s desire to consume mayonnaise. Death generally occurs within 48 hours, by which time the virus has completely liquefied the host’s gastrointestinal tract. Although officials originally hoped direct appeals to the American public would curtail the spread, two simultaneous educational campaigns and a series of warning labels have proved ineffective, and experts are now estimating the that death toll will surpass 100,000. “All citizens within the affected zones please be advised: If you absolutely have to put mayonnaise in your potato salad, at least use a clean knife,” said Gerberding, specifically referring to those living in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia, and Pennsylvania—the region commonly known as the “Mayo Belt.” “And I cannot stress this enough: If a glob of mayo comes in contact with your skin, do not lick it off.” Gerberding also cautioned that there is no “safe” mayonnaise, and that adding flavors such as chipotle will not counteract the virus’s effect. Thus far, the public seems unfazed by the rapidly disseminating, initially tasty pathogen, with many brave citizens saying they will continue buying and consuming the condiment regardless of its potential health risks. “I don’t want a dry sandwich,” said Salt Lake City native Scott Hagens, 42. “That’s no way to eat.” “If I get it, I get it,” said Louisville resident Debra Rothman, 56. “I’m not going to change my whole life around every time they come on TV and say something is bad for you.” With the virus claiming more victims each day, the CDC has utilized all available outlets to urge citizens to avoid such mayonnaise-heavy foods as deviled eggs, tuna salad, and coleslaw. But new figures suggest the rampant media images of mayo-enhanced products may have backfired. Sales of the creamy sandwich topping have increased 55 percent since the public service announcements began. “Thankfully we didn’t warn people not to eat spoonfuls of mayo straight out of the jar,” one anonymous CDC official said. As the nation’s top microbiologists feverishly work to develop a vaccine for the virus, they continue to face setbacks, as many of the mayonnaise samples procured for analysis have disappeared from the laboratory. Fortunately, doctors have found some success using heavy doses of antibiotics to combat the virulent disease. “Left unchecked, Hellmansviridae could potentially wipe out all human life in North America by the end of lunch on Friday,” said Dr. Derek Patterson, an infectious disease specialist. “But tests show it can be treated with antibiotics when patients reduce their daily intake of mayonnaise to three tablespoons or less per 12 hours.” “Sadly, only one in 100 Americans has effectively been able to reduce personal mayo consumption to these levels,” Patterson added. Upon successful development of a vaccine, CDC officials had planned to administer the preventative treatment through a hummus-based delivery system, but initial testing showed high levels of human resistance to any potential medicinal chickpea spread. The public health organization is now seeking FDA approval for a mayo-based mayo vaccine. “I pray my colleagues will be able to find a cure before it’s too late,” Dr. Gerberding said. “But, at the moment, it seems all we can hope for is a Miracle Whip.”"
People With That Brain-Eating Virus Should Really Just Take A Sick Day,8/13/08,4285,"I know we live in a career-oriented society, but if you ask me, people's priorities in the workplace are all out of whack. Sure, everyone wants to shine, to be that ""go-to"" gal or guy, but sometimes it goes too far. In my opinion, when you come down with something, be it the common cold, the flu, or that brain-eating virus that's been going around, you should just take a sick day. It's a simple matter of courtesy to those around you. No one is so ""indispensable"" that they can't take a day off without everything going off the rails. I know I'd rather do a little extra filing than have to watch someone's brain get slowly devoured by a deadly parasitic organism in the middle of a meeting, for Pete's sake. Coming into the office with anything more than the sniffles is just unprofessional. If you know you've contracted an airborne pathogen that attacks the cerebellum like millions of tiny, insatiable sharks, why not do us all a favor and keep your contagious self home in bed? In this Information Age, most work can be done from home anyway. It's just as easy to get an e-mail saying ""My head! Kill me! Please, someone kill me!"" than to hear Julie Weingarten scream it at the top of her lungs from the next cubicle. Remember the time Keith caught that weird stomach virus from his son, and within two weeks everyone in the office had come down with it? Well, I was sick for two days, and all I thought was, ""Keith, why did you even come in today?"" The office would be a lot more productive if there were fewer government agents in hazmat suits traipsing in and out to drag people off to containment facilities, I tell you. And when you consider the fact that this brain-eating virus carves out tunnels in your frontal lobes, makes your eyeballs bleed, and swells your glands up to eight times their normal size before it chews away the last vestige of your conscious self, it should be pretty obvious to anyone that you have something serious enough to call in sick for. If you don't stay at home and get better, you just take up valuable time, the whole system gets backed up, and then Harvey's breathing down everyone's neck about falling behind. God, I miss Harvey. Plus, according to the emergency warning announcements blaring out of every loudspeaker in the city, being out of doors at all is dangerous. Yet these same people—who can barely even get from room to room without walking into a wall 10 or 15 times—have the nerve to get behind the wheel and commute to work! What if they hit a kid? And those annoying exploding pustules that shoot green mucus across the room—yuck! Jerry was in the kitchen with me when those sores decided to go off, and one landed right in my salad! I had to throw it out! I'm still a little peeved at him, even after he drowned himself in a mop bucket to stop the pain. It's just more work for the rest of us when we have to drag your diseased corpses into the parking lot and incinerate them with flamethrowers. To say nothing of the fact that those sores are filled with an acid that burns through anything in its path. I shouldn't have to worry about getting dissolved alive on top of everything else I do around here! Nobody likes it when a security breach at a top-secret laboratory leads to the slow and painful death of everyone you know and love, but that's what sick days are for. I swear, if our manager, Ted, hadn't been found under his desk half-dissolved in a pile of flesh and cartilage, I would have filed a formal complaint. Now I have to wait until corporate sends us a new manager, but knowing this company, that could be weeks. Maybe longer if the government collapses and the country is plunged into anarchy like those terror-struck young men in the National Guard truck were yelling about. Honestly, the company's time-off policy is at least partially to blame. With the holidays coming up, and only five sick days per year, it's no surprise people are hesitant to take them just because some nightmarish doomsday scenario is rapidly annihilating what remains of Western civilization. So if this whole ""brain-virus epidemic"" thing has any upside, it will be that this company, and many others across the nation, will take a long, hard look at their sick-leave policies. Well, that's unlikely, but there's always hope!"

""Most of these people are barely even buzzed, and 87 percent of the time they're driving primarily on back roads for distances of like, eight miles, tops,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Henry Tillman, adding that the vast majority of inebriated drivers stuck with only beer all night, so they were totally fine. ""Roughly 64 percent of drunk drivers have cousins who are cops anyway, so it's really no big deal."" The study concluded that a mere one in 15 drunk drivers end up dying in a cascading torrent of fire, so, you know, odds."
My Morbidly Obese Wife Said The Most Interesting Thing The Other Day,7/30/08,4091,"After 23 years of marriage, you'd think there would be nothing in the world my morbidly obese wife could do to surprise me anymore. You'd say, ""Howard, I bet you know just about everything there is to know about that massive woman of yours."" But I guess I still have a lot to learn, because yesterday morning my wife, who is quite fat, turns her head to me and says, ""They should do a game show hosted by that father from Growing Pains."" Just like that! I just laughed and thought to myself, ""That's my 450-pound wife for you—always full of surprises!"" It's times like these, when she catches me off guard with an insightful comment, that I remember why I married her in the first place. My Kate is truly one of the sweetest, fattest, smartest people I know. She's not only my enormous wife—she's my enormous best friend. And she's funny, too! Whenever we have guests over at the house, watch out, because my unhealthily overweight wife keeps everyone on their toes with her trademark wit! Like three years ago on my birthday, she gave me this card that had an old man on the front with only four teeth in his mouth, and on the inside it said ""Happy Four-Teeth-ith Birthday!"" Kate was already giggling before I walked over to her couch-bed to grab the card from between her pudgy, bloated sausage-fingers, so of course I knew something was up. Sure enough, another Kate classic! Boy, my dirigible-sized wife sure knows how to make me laugh. It's so important to marry someone you can talk to. Over the course of any relationship, you go through lots of ups and downs. On the good days, you're traveling around and going to dinner parties and everyone's still able to fit through standard doorways, but other days are harder, and you've got to be able to cheer each other up when things get tough and you can no longer share a bed in any real sense of the term. But no matter how bad things get, I can always rely on good old immobile-flesh-mound Kate to make me smile. God, I'm so lucky to have such a fat interesting fat wife. She really is one of a kind, my Kate. Whenever I see her reading books on treating the various skin disorders that result from chronic obesity or just drowning in her own sweat, I can tell the wheels in her head are spinning. She never stops thinking! Every day, she's thinking and thinking and eating and widening…growing. It's like every part of her is bigger than the next. She's not even a woman anymore, she's just this—this thing I inject insulin into while it consumes stacks of honey-glazed ham like a thresher and says the most adorable things when it isn't wheezing or choking on its own spit and bile. I love my wife! Just yesterday we were watching the news and John McCain started talking about how Barack Obama wants to make gas unaffordable for middle-class Americans, and then my wife kind of swayed her arms back and forth to work up the momentum to shift her body in my direction, and as the bulk of what was once her left breast toppled down her expansive upper belly and under her right arm, she said, ""Gas is already unaffordable for most middle-class Americans."" And wouldn't you know it, as soon as it was his turn to speak, I'll be damned if Obama didn't say almost the same thing! I swear, if she'd been upright and wasn't being strangled by her own neck flab, I could have kissed her. I don't mean to go on and on bragging about my amazing wife who's killing herself with food, so I'll just tell you one more vintage Kate story. It's a doozy. See, back in college, my then-not- unspeakably-obese wife lived in a sorority house that used to throw these wild parties. And one time, Kate had a few too many and—well, there was this bra hanging from a ceiling fan and—or was it the staircase? Darn it, she was just telling me yesterday in the kitchen. We were talking about her old sorority and college, and she was telling me about this Halloween party they threw and I realized the skin folds of her underarms were no longer symmetrical and then she said…. Oh, you know what, I just don't tell it as well as my heaving sack of a wife does."

"Falling Down Laundry Chute And Breaking Neck Remains America's No. 548,221 Killer",6/20/08,4121,"ATLANTA—With more than four such deaths occurring over the past seven years, safety advocates are once again concerned about fatalities resulting from falling down a laundry chute and breaking one's neck, an accident that is still among the top 600,000 killers of Americans. Although other deadly mishaps have increased during the first half of 2008—most notably shooting oneself in the head after mistaking a handgun for a telephone, which jumped four spots to the No. 548,219 most common cause of death—Dr. Lawrence Dunn, a public health expert and spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cautioned that citizens should remain aware of laundry chute– related fatalities. ""Lethal spinal-cord injuries involving laundry chutes may not be as prevalent as deaths stemming from inserting too many peas into one's nose, but that doesn't mean they don't occur,"" said Dunn, referring to Nasal-Legume Asphyxiation, the nation's No. 499,987 killer. ""Of the approximately 40 people who fall down laundry chutes every six years, a consistent 10 percent continue to break their necks and die."" Dunn also outlined the economic impact of nonfatal injuries attributed to laundry-chute mishaps. These accidents have been blamed for more than $350 in lost productivity in 2007 alone, just $50 less than incidents involving the eating of thumbtacks while sleepwalking. Though the statistics presented by the CDC appear dire, there are some who remain hopeful the trend can be turned around. According to the Michael Baron Foundation, a charitable organization established to reduce fatalities caused by falling down a laundry chute and breaking one's neck, there are several ways to lower the incidence of this extremely specific accident. ""As with any other health and safety issue, the key to prevention is education,"" said David Baron, who started the foundation after his son was killed in a Cleveland-area Regency Hotel laundry chute in 1997. ""If you accidentally drop a Nerf football or, as in Michael's case, half a Snickers bar down a laundry chute, walk down to the basement to retrieve it. At the very least enter the chute feetfirst."" Added Baron, ""It is important to remember that the attitude of 'falling down a laundry chute and breaking my neck will never happen to me or my family' is exactly what puts people at risk for these types of horrible accidents."" According to researchers, it is nearly impossible to predict who is most at risk of succumbing to falling down a laundry chute and breaking one's neck. Baron said that of the 28 people who have been killed in this manner over the past 45 years, nearly every ethnicity and age group is represented, adding, ""laundry chute–neck breakage is everyone's problem."" ""Falling down a laundry chute and breaking your neck does not discriminate,"" Baron said. ""Anyone who has access to a shaft long enough to build up the velocity sufficient to fracture any of the C1 through C7 vertebrae is a potential victim."" ""It is, however, one of the few cases in which obesity is beneficial,"" Baron continued. ""An overweight person will often become wedged in the chute, preventing a fatal fall."" Baron was careful to point out that people with weight problems should still take necessary precautions when working with or around laundry chutes. Citing statistics gathered by the Melinda Havemeyer Foundation, Baron said that becoming stuck in a laundry chute and starving to death because the rest of one's family is on vacation in Arizona is currently the No. 657,982 killer in the United States. In addition to increasing public awareness of deaths caused by falling down a laundry chute and severing the spinal cord, Baron suggested several direct precautionary measures. These include keeping a hamper full of extra pillows at the bottom of laundry chutes at all times, placing large, easy-to-read warning placards around chute openings, and moving to a house without a laundry chute. ""Until someone comes up with a safer means of conveying dirty laundry from the top floor of a house to its basement, this is the reality we have to live with,"" Baron said."
I'm Training To Ruin A Marathon,6/18/08,4428,"When I set my mind to something, there's no turning back, no slowing down, and no excuses. So when I heard about the upcoming 17th Annual Richland County Marathon, I started training immediately. For the last four months, I have been pushing myself to the brink of exhaustion to prepare my mind and body for the ultimate physical challenge: ruining a marathon. I'm going to ruin the whole thing. Now, I know what you're thinking. Sure, everyone would like to ruin a marathon, but who among us has the discipline and energy to get up at the crack of dawn morning after morning, through rain, sleet, and snow, and practice handing out cups of vinegar to the frontrunners? Me, that's who. Yes, there are some mornings when it's darn near impossible to keep going—when you feel like you just can't chip one more pothole in the course with a pickax. But endurance ruining is all about pushing through the pain. And when the big day comes, and you make it over that final hurdle, dodge the cops, and shove an old guy into the bushes, you'll know all that training was worth it. Granted, I've never taken on anything of this magnitude before. Oh, I used to ruin cross-country meets back in high school. And there was that father-son fun ruin I did back in '06, of course, but that was just for charity. If I'm going to needlessly sabotage a full 26.2 miles of road, I have to make sure I'm at the top of my game. No ifs, ands, or buts. That's why I like to start off my training day bright and early with a full breakfast of espresso, some diet pills, and a small bag of rock candy. It keeps me edgy and volatile when I'm in the thick of disrupting a tight race. Also—and I can't stress this enough—it's very important to stretch properly before and after yelling derogatory remarks at Kenyans. You don't want your legs cramping up on the way to the escape route. Training rituals like this may seem tiresome and pointless now, but trust me: When you're two hours into terrorizing a highly anticipated marathon, they make all the difference in the world. After you've been ruining a marathon for a couple hours, your body will just take over and you won't even realize that you're spoiling the day for everyone. I call that getting in the ""ruiner's zone."" It's like my arms and legs could just keep dumping buckets of cooking oil off a highway overpass forever. When you get there, more than ever, it's important to keep focused and not let your mind wander. You've got a lot of race to wreck, and you've got to keep your mind sharp for what's coming up ahead. It's good to make a checklist in my mind, so I don't get distracted on race day. Are there any cables or streamers around that I can use as trip wires? Is this a good time to call the fire department to report a massive four-alarm blaze at the 12-mile mark? Do I hip-check the guy in front of me or stop abruptly and trip up the three people behind? If I make all the right decisions, and really push myself, I could ruin this marathon in record time. The biggest thing I've learned about training to thwart a marathon is that you have to set small, manageable goals for yourself, and then gradually work up to bigger, more challenging goals. Try starting off with something simple, like printing out ""Marathon Continues to the Right"" signs and pasting them up by the on-ramp to the interstate. Once you're comfortable with that, you can work your way up to a larger goal, like breaking beer bottles into a sack and dumping them out in front of the wheelchair racers, or loading up on carbs and dairy so you can vomit all over the finish line. As the day of the marathon approaches, it's easy to psych yourself out by thinking of all the tiny things that could go wrong. The hornets could all die en route to the starting line, or I might forget to slash the tires of the first-aid trucks that follow the runners. But when you're ruining a marathon, you have to push all those little what-ifs out of your head and just go out there and try your hardest. Sure, you might not end up ruining every inch of the marathon, but just imagine the looks on their faces when 300-plus people fail to cross that finish line. Race day's tomorrow. No more excuses. No more letting my own fears, or my wife's sobbing pleas, or the combined efforts of city and state law enforcement agencies get in the way of me accomplishing my goal. No, sir. Not this time. I've trained too hard for that."

Way Too Much Raised For Bronchitis Research,6/04/08,839,"MINNEAPOLIS—The nonprofit organization Clean Airways announced Tuesday that it had raised the completely unnecessary sum of $140 million to further the study of bronchitis, a minor inflammation of the lungs which has claimed zero lives in 75 years and primarily affects smokers. ""With this [ridiculous] amount of money, doctors will have the means to better understand bronchitis, and learn to treat it faster,"" Clean Airways spokeswoman Linda McDonald said about the marginal illness, which, unlike AIDS, cancer, or muscular dystrophy, usually clears up after two weeks. ""Hopefully next year we can raise even more."" Though McDonald did not comment on exactly how the record-breaking sum would be spent, she would not confirm or deny the possibility of simply purchasing 280 million bags of Halls orange-flavored mentholyptus cough drops."

Badly Injured Man Not Done Partying Yet,4/26/08,4176,"BATON ROUGE, LA—Veteran partier Adam Girard announced his intentions to continue partying late Saturday evening, assuring onlookers that the multiple injuries he had sustained over the previous six hours did not require medical attention, and were not severe enough to prematurely end the festivities. Despite the fact that Girard, who was attending a house party near the Louisiana State Univeristy campus, had twice fallen more than eight feet onto his shoulder while attempting to walk along the front-porch banister, the 24-year-old bookstore clerk appeared resolute in his commitment to continue consuming alcohol, singing, dancing, and hitting empty beer cans like baseballs with the tube of an old vacuum cleaner. ""Whoo! Party!"" Girard said. ""Someone get—turn on Rock Band. I'll be all like, 'Bwah. Bwah-bwah.'"" According to witnesses, the recent college graduate arrived at the party sometime during the mid-afternoon barbecue without any visible bruises, abrasions, or long scratch marks down the left side of his face. As the afternoon progressed, Girard enjoyed an estimated 12 Miller Lites before moving on to rum and Cokes, shots of tequila, boxed wine, and Miller Lite again. By 10:30 p.m., onlookers said, Girard had played more than a dozen games of beer pong and badly scraped the insides of both arms attempting to climb a nearby oak tree on what he misinterpreted as a dare. ""I really just wanted to keep my distance,"" said party attendee Eric McGill, 22, who added that he did not know how Girard had irritated his eye, but guessed it had something to do with an earlier incident involving a can of hairspray. ""He was scaring the shit out of me. I have no idea how he managed that keg stand with his elbow bent back like that."" A number of acquaintances said they were unable to dissuade Girard from completing his partying agenda, which apparently included riding a mattress down a flight of stairs and ""boxing"" a number of lawn ornaments. ""I tried to tell him sprains don't heal themselves, but he kept calling me a pussy and telling me to chug,"" said Girard's roommate, 23-year-old Darren Iverson. ""I wasn't even holding a beer at the time. I'm pretty sure he has a concussion."" Added Iverson, ""And I know you can't use Jäger to clean a wound."" At several points throughout the evening, those in attendance assumed Girard had ceased partying and gone home. Though everyone thought Girard had left, a small group arriving at the party shortly after midnight discovered him lying behind a shrub in the front of the house. When they woke him, Girard reportedly jumped up ""like a fucking leopard or something"" and ran into the house. A few hours later, Girard was seen taking a bicycle from a neighbor's garage and pedaling down the street, yelling out that he was going to go for a swim and that his collarbone was fine. ""When he came back, his hair had some blood in it and there were grass stains all over his shirt,"" said Jenny Bergman, 21, who added that she did not realize the figure stumbling across the front lawn was Girard until she saw that he was drinking beer from a Crock Pot. ""He was holding a license plate for some reason, which he threw onto the roof."" ""I offered to bandage his arm but he said his biceps would just break it,"" Bergman continued. This was reportedly not the first time Girard has persevered through significant obstacles. In May 2007, he overcame a dislocated shoulder to attend the minor-league baseball game he had spent the morning tailgating for; later that summer, Girard won a poker tournament even after burning his hands attempting to light shots of vodka on fire; and, on his 21st birthday, he partied all night despite having spinal meningitis. Host Brian Warren, 23, finally asked Girard to leave and check in to the hospital at 4:15 a.m., just after Girard broke Warren's plastic lawn furniture attempting to climb onto the roof for the third time that evening. ""I need my license plate,"" Girard said. ""Fucking."" Though Girard had not returned home as of press time, a limping hitchhiker fitting his description was recently seen across town wearing a shower curtain and asking for a ride ""back to the party."""

Wii Video Games Blamed For Rise In Effeminate Violence,3/17/08,4209,"WASHINGTON—Concerned parents are again blasting the Nintendo Wii for an incident of effeminate violence following a 13-year-old boy's limp-wristed attack on three of his classmates at a Cleveland-area middle school Tuesday. The incident—the sixth of its kind in as many months—has left parents searching for answers and struggling to comprehend the dainty assault, which left the necks of two sweaters severely stretched out and countless fingers stubbed. ""These games are a prissy little menace to our society,"" said Linda Roberts, 35, a mother of three and founder of the group Parents Against Wii, which is suing Nintendo for $52 million in damages from two recent swattings. ""One of these days, the red marks on our children's arms might not just go away after five minutes."" The Wii, now the most popular gaming system in the country, most recently came under fire last month, when 15-year-old Los Angeles student Brian Strickland, who reportedly plays Wii Sports tennis, was expelled for flicking his wrist back and forth at a fellow sophomore's head. And in January, 12-year-old Boulder, CO native Andrew Conner, a fan of the WarioWare: Smooth Moves game, was hospitalized after swinging his arm like an elephant trunk into members of the eighth-grade boys basketball team. ""The Nintendo company is knowingly exposing our children to disturbing acts of foppishness right in our living rooms,"" said Roberts of PAW. ""Even more frightening, the motion-sensing technology teaches them that the only way to resolve conflicts is to flail their arms in acts of fruity aggression."" Wii's critics claim that the sissified games use disturbing pastel imagery, graphic representations of adorable characters, and disorienting kaleidoscopes of color to prey on children's basest flaming instincts. The game Dewy's Adventure, in which children control a cute droplet of water who must return fruit to a magical tree, is often cited as one of the worst offenders. ""Three years ago, our children were not prancing after their peers and brutally flicking each other on the playground,"" Roberts said. ""They were well-behaved wimps who spent their recess periods hiding from bullies. What are these terrible games doing to our country's sallies?"" While no scientific link has ever been established, a report to be released by PAW later this month indicates an alarming correlation between Wii's growing popularity and a shocking 200-percent increase in wuss-on-wuss violence. In addition, the group documented 634 incidents of fussy skirmishes, all of which ended in tears. According to the American Psychological Association, prolonged exposure to cutesy video-game violence can increase aggressive frolicking and angry fluttering in children. Paula Greer, co-chair of the APA Committee on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media, warned that Wii games reward players for explosive girly behavior rather than enforcing proper negative social consequences. ""The Wii's fluffy flowers and bright peach-colored sunlight glorify chasing precious talking rabbits with plungers,"" Greer said. ""What kind of message is that sending to our children? That it's 'cool' to act like some kind of electrical elf or banana fairy?"" The APA is working with the Entertainment Software Rating Board to update its rating system to reflect the perceived influence of Wii on children's behavior. According to suggested guidelines, games that contain insipid language, vigorous paint scrubbing, and mild to moderate bell-ringing will be rated P for Pansy; those that include simulated sand-pouring and intense lily-pad racing will be rated NP for Namby-Pamby. But some believe critics of the Wii are overreacting. Benjamin Warren, a First Amendment lawyer based in New York, defended the video game manufacturer, claiming it alone did not invent priggish hostility. ""Limp-wristed flapping has been around for as long as children have had wrists,"" Warren said. ""Our society has always blamed whatever new trend comes along, be it windmills, knitting, the harpsichord, or Jazzercise."" Added Warren, ""Wii is just the latest target—a fuzzy, pink, cuddly little target with big eyes and a squeaky voice that just makes you want to eat it up."""

Area Senior Remembers A Simpler Time When His Anus Didn't Leak,2/02/08,4137,"CARSON CITY, NV—Looking out his window as the cars zoom by and a jet plane rumbles overhead, 87-year-old Hank Fletcher sees a world far different from the one in which he grew up. In his day, the retired factory worker says, life was simpler. The streets were quieter, people were more polite, neighbors all knew one another, and his anus did not emit oily discharges of liquid stool. But times have changed. ""When I was a young man, there was no uncertainty in the world—dinner was at 5:30 sharp, people who got married stayed that way, and my anus didn't leak,"" Fletcher says. ""I can still remember playing stickball till the sun dipped below the trees. Why, I'd round the bases pretending I was Rogers Hornsby without ever having to think about a viscous brown liquid trickling down my leg. The future seemed so bright."" As time marches on, Fletcher remains one of the last direct links to a bygone era of American life when people passed their evenings relaxing by the fireside or listening to Hopalong Cassidy on the radio. Mothers and fathers would sit on couches free from protective plastic covers, and children would play games in the corner, oblivious to the crime, famine, and warm streams of fluid seeping out of their anal cavities that seem so commonplace today. ""How I loved to stroll down the promenade arm in arm with my best gal, Dorothy,"" Fletcher says, shifting in his chair as he pages wistfully through a faded old scrapbook. ""We'd talk and laugh, unconstrained by bulky plastic sacks tied to our waists, and go into all the shops—never to buy anything, of course, just to look and to dream. We'd wander along the boardwalk all evening, she with her blue Gainsborough hat and I with my clean underpants, all the while holding hands and not ejecting fecal matter from our anuses."" ""But Dorothy's been gone for many a year now,"" he adds as he closes the scrapbook, ""and as for my anus, well, as I said before, it leaks constantly."" Seated on a rocking chair covered in a blue tarpaulin to protect the wood from foul-smelling stains, Fletcher chuckled to recall how tiny and hard to come by TV sets were in those days. His family had only one car, he could see a movie for a quarter, soda pop only cost a nickel, and his sphincter was strong enough to expand and contract when he intended instead of hanging permanently open like an unlatched floodgate. ""Back then, the days were as cool and sweet as a sip of lemonade, and the night sky was filled to the brim with bright shiny stars,"" Fletcher says. ""Now there's so much noise and pollution that you can't even hear yourself think. People are always screaming and shouting for no good reason, zipping around from place to place, and the hustle and the bustle and my anus leaks, and it's all computers."" ""Glenn Miller, jalopy rides, Lucky Lindy, my non-leaking anus,"" Fletcher adds. ""Those were the days."" Indeed, this octogenarian lived most his life in a time that made him proud to be an American and during which he did not have to change his pants five times a day. He can recall as if it were yesterday seeing the troops come home after Normandy, when the nation was riding high and his feces were satisfyingly firm cylinders that easily held their shape in water; and watching two men land on the moon just moments after he expelled the contents of his bowels all at once in the bathroom rather than in dribs and drabs over the course of an afternoon. Then, on Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists flew two hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and Fletcher's anus leaked, and he knew the world had changed forever. ""Things ain't how they used to be,"" he says, shaking his head. ""Especially in regards to my anus."" Despite it all, Fletcher admits that today's youth have it harder than ever. Amid fears of war, global warming, and political instability, Fletcher leaves the younger generations with a simple word of advice from a man who has seen it all. ""Every once in a while, take a moment to appreciate everything you have in this life,"" Fletcher says, ""because before you know it, the world will pass you by, and also your underpants will be moist with shit."""

Only Positive Statistic Of Year Announced,12/12/07,1009,"WASHINGTON—Amid a growing list of domestic and international concerns such as skyrocketing fuel prices, the slumping dollar, massive recalls of tainted food, the housing market collapse, and an increase in obesity, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals delivered the country's only positive statistic Tuesday when officials announced that cases of feline leukemia had stabilized. ""In this current climate, we were all waiting for some good news,"" said Brad Gambrell, 37, an unemployed census worker. ""With more infants perishing during childbirth, fewer citizens covered by health insurance, and air quality steadily worsening, it's a huge relief that the number of cats dying from this horrible disease is staying the same."" Additional data showed that, upon hearing the news, hundreds of Americans who were being evicted from their homes or learning that they had colon cancer briefly experienced a glimmer of hope—a once-common sensation that has declined by 250 percent since 2002."
Bush's New Dentist Faces Tough Confirmation Hearing,12/09/07,4569,"WASHINGTON—The Senate Judiciary Committee announced Monday that, after five days of intense questioning, internal debate, and outside testimony, it is no closer to confirming Dr. Richard J. Applebaum, President George W. Bush's controversial nominee to be the 73rd presidential dentist in U.S. history. Applebaum—a Howard University College of Dentistry graduate, owner of the private practice Gentle Dental, and close friend of the Bush family—faced a seemingly unending battery of questions during the first week of his confirmation hearing, with the committee's 19 members grilling him on issues ranging from tooth decay to tartar control to the divisive ""brushing side-to-side or up-and-down"" question. According to committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), however, the most important matter is restoring honor and dignity to the dentist's office. ""We cannot stand by and allow the Republicans to rubber-stamp another dentist,"" Leahy said on NBC's Meet The Press Sunday. ""We need someone with integrity. Someone who will not ignore untreated abscesses in the posterior region of the mouth. Someone who will not simply be told that Mr. Bush flosses daily and blindly accept that as fact. Someone who is tough on plaque, yet gentle around the gums."" Applebaum's testimony thus far indicates that he has always been a vocal proponent of mercury amalgam fillings, which does not sit well with some of the Democrats in the Senate. He has, however, earned bipartisan approval for his policy on latex gloves. In addition, he has shown a commitment to featuring a wide selection of toothpaste flavors—including pina colada—and, with the exception of two occasions in the summer of 1992, has consistently consulted patients beforehand as to their favorite flavor. His stance on fluoride treatment is unknown. Although Applebaum's testimony has revealed a philosophy largely in line with current dental thought, his record is not unblemished. An FBI investigation launched shortly after his nomination revealed conflicting viewpoints on the issue of brushing. ""Dr. Applebaum, according to our records, in March of 1999, you told a patient by the name of Bev Kaplansky that it was advisable to brush twice a day. Yet just two years later, in February of 2001, you told one Mr. Grayson Peters that brushing should occur after every meal,"" a transcript of Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-IL) questioning read in part. ""Well, which is it, Dr. Applebaum? Two times a day, or after every meal?"" Applebaum's refusal to answer Sen. Durbin's question has led many Democrats and some Republicans to declare that they will not support his confirmation, claiming that they do not want ""another Dr. Cesario."" Dr. Samuel Cesario, Bush's previous dentist, served for a tumultuous two years before resigning in October amid accusations that he politicized the position by handing out free toothbrushes and floss dispensers to the president, that he was pro-gingivitis, and that he ordered the illegal torture of several U.S.-held detainees. While most agree that Applebaum represents a significant upgrade from Cesario, Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) was disappointed that Bush did not select the senator's own dentist, Dr. Harry Gellert, whom Specter has long championed as ""a very nice man."" The media, meanwhile, has often portrayed Applebaum as a beneficiary of nepotism, as both his father and grandfather worked in the dental profession. Some critics have been even harsher. In a recent segment that has been highly circulated on the Internet and within the political blogosphere, MSNBC's Keith Olbermann called Applebaum, 52, a ""spineless hypocrite who is being called on not to clean teeth, but to obsequiously kowtow to the Bush administration."" ""In a 1987 checkup with a young child who shall remain nameless, you purportedly discouraged the consumption of so-called 'sweets,' but just moments later, sir, you rewarded that same child with a lollipop from the office treasure chest,"" Olbermann said during a ""special comment"" addressed to Applebaum on the program Countdown. ""Are we to believe that you do not classify lollipops as 'sweets,' sir? And more importantly: Is this really the man we want scraping the gums of the leader of the free world?"" Though Bush, who is said to be suffering from a severe toothache, has urged a swift confirmation and even threatened to name Applebaum as a recess appointment, there is speculation that the Democrats may attempt to filibuster the nomination, as they did to 1968 chief justice appointee Abe Fortas and 2003 White House plumber nominee Dave."
"Overweight College Student Announces Plans To Wear Shorts, Sandals For Rest Of Year",12/07/07,4192,"STATE COLLEGE, PA—Overweight Penn State University freshman Kyle Norton cleared up any confusion about the future of his daily wardrobe Monday when he declared that, despite the recent drop in temperature, he will continue sporting the same mesh Penn State Lacrosse shorts and Birkenstock sandals he has worn since the start of the 2007–08 academic year. The lunchtime announcement, which was made at Penn State's Pollock dining hall, followed a week of speculation as to why the 19-year-old failed to return from Thanksgiving vacation with essential winter clothing items such as pants, socks, boots, or closed-toe shoes. ""I know many of you are wondering if I will start wearing what many consider 'appropriate' clothing because the weather is getting more frigid,"" said the heavy-set, 5-foot-10-inch Norton, who has worn his signature outfit 106 days in a row. ""I want everyone to know that I remain steadfast in my decision to wear shorts and sandals, and only shorts and sandals. I assure you that this decision is final and will remain as such no matter how severe conditions outside become."" ""The cold weather just doesn't bother me,"" Norton added. Norton, who has unkempt curly brown hair that detracts attention from his perfectly rounded figure, and a scraggily beard that sparsely covers his face and double chin, stated that he would also forgo a winter coat this year, and would continue to don the same loose-fitting, coffee-stained hooded sweatshirt he has been wearing since mid-October. In addition, Norton dispelled rumors that he would be making any adjustments to his current rotation of the three short-sleeved shirts he wears underneath the half-zipped sweatshirt, which reportedly include an XXL plain white T-shirt, a black Monty Python Life of Brian shirt, and the shirt from his 2005 high school production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, for which Norton served on the build crew. After concluding his announcement, Norton lumbered back to his dorm room to spend the afternoon ""lying around and maybe practicing [guitar]."" According to Dr. Marie Stratton, a professor of sociology at Harvard University who observed Norton's behavior for several weeks, Norton's odd choice of wardrobe is not uncommon. ""You must understand that, due to Kyle's awkward and bulbous frame, the simple act of bending over to put on a pair of pants has become a daily ordeal,"" Stratton said in a telephone interview. ""As a defense mechanism, Kyle will claim to his peers that his decision to wear loose clothing with elastic waistbands and no restriction around the ankles is not one of convenience, but rather a characteristic of his unique personality and 'laid-back' attitude. Kyle intends to use this strategy to divert attention away from his obvious and glaring obesity and become someone who is idolized by his peers for his ability to remain unfazed by bitter cold temperatures."" ""It is a truly remarkable and valiant effort,"" Stratton added. Though temperatures are expected to dip into the mid-20s this week, a shorts-and- sandals-wearing Kyle told reporters that not only will he keep walking at the same leisurely pace to his 9 a.m. philosophy seminar, but he will also continue sitting outside the building 10 minutes before class while he smokes a cigarette and does the crossword puzzle in Penn State's student newspaper, The Daily Collegian. Although there are no rumors to the contrary, Norton added that he would not cease eating ice cream during the walk from the dining hall back to his dorm room. Upon being asked if his behavior was merely for attention, Norton balked at the notion, saying that the choice is ""just who he is."" ""I always hated when my mom made me wear shoes and pants in high school,"" Norton said. ""Now that I am in college I am free to wear whatever I want, whenever I want. For the first time in my life, I don't feel so constricted."" Though some of Norton's fellow students are concerned for his well-being during the upcoming winter months, most have taken the announcement in stride. ""Oh, yeah, the fat dude with the shorts and sandals,"" Penn State sophomore Ryan Mullaney said. ""I think I have a Spanish class with that guy."""
U.S. Breath Reaches All-Time Worst,12/07/07,4721,"WASHINGTON—Responding to a foul stench emanating from the mouths of Americans nationwide, officials from the U.S. Department of Breath and Human Services issued an emergency announcement Tuesday warning that American breath quality has been elevated to ""stank mouth,"" the poorest single rating in the nation's 231-year history. In a solemn announcement, DBHS Secretary Michael Leavitt informed the nation that his organization initially considered ignoring the findings, believing that the situation would resolve itself after the next routine tooth-brushing. ""After several days with no improvement in odor, it became painfully clear that this agency simply had to say something,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt maintained that DBHS is doing all it can and will continue to observe the worsening crisis from at least three feet away. Added Leavitt, ""I am compelled to ask the American people: What did you eat?"" Attempting to handle the awkward national emergency in the most delicate manner, health officials at first theorized that everyone in the country had been out late the night before and did not have a chance to freshen up in the morning. But after more than 400,000 uncomfortable conversations, officials deemed it necessary to notify the American public in order to prevent the loss of more social lives. ""We can no longer afford to turn our heads away and ignore this problem,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt urged all Americans to accept a breath mint or a stick of gum, or, if such items are not available, a carbonated drink, which he claimed was not clinically proven to be an effective remedy, although there is some evidence that the carbon dioxide molecules may in effect ""burn away"" stink germs temporarily. Despite the urgency and magnitude of DBHS's announcement, some critics maintain that the response has been shortsighted and only aimed at making the problem temporarily smell like mint. Some even claim the putrid smell might already be irreversible. ""This Band-Aid approach will work, but only for a few hours at most,"" said Walter Romano, D.D.S., a Cleveland-area dentist who has begun handing out free toothbrushes and stickers depicting sound oral hygiene to residents in his area. ""This country hasn't flossed in years. In fact, I believe some people have even made the ill-advised decision to gargle not with mouthwash, but almost exclusivley with dog shit."" Others claim the problem is even worse than health officials are letting on. ""This is a full-blown stenchademic,"" said Dr. Guy Hammond, a leading researcher of smelliness, who added that the catastrophe will only worsen with dinner approaching. ""Before long, the U.S. will surpass even Britain as the nation with the worst breath in the Western world."" According to an independent study conducted by Hammond, the percentage of Americans whose breath could scare the stink off a skunk increased dramatically over the past year, from 17 percent to 29 percent, while the number of citizens whose breath could peel paint off the wall went up from 23 percent to 45 percent. The remainder of Americans, the study found, had breath so bad it could sink a battleship. While no direct cause has been determined for the sudden spike in ass-mouth, officials believe it may be connected to a combination of garlic, onion, meat, cheese, tobacco, coffee, alcohol, plaque, laziness, and bodily fluids. With initial tests showing the rancid odor to be virtually impervious to multiple applications of Big Red, Leavitt said his agency is urging citizens to avoid inhaling through their noses, and cover their mouths when they talk. ""Sadly, millions of Americans were raised to believe they could cup their hand and put it over their face to smell their breath,"" Leavitt told reporters. ""But our top scientists and health experts informed me personally about 20 minutes ago that this method does not work."" DBHS has embarked on a widespread campaign to eliminate the deadly odors found in almost every mouth in the country.  Refreshing relief has been slow to come, however: Efforts to deliver 30,000 gallons of ACT rinse to the hardest-hit regions of the country have stalled because so many National Guardsmen are already deployed in Iraq and the rest refused to go anywhere near the most troubled cities. In addition, attempts by FEMA workers to distribute Tic Tacs to citizens in Alabama and Texas also failed when hundreds were injured attempting to open the plastic boxes' flip-action lids.  On Wednesday, officials at the Center for Gum Disease Control and Prevention announced plans to quarantine those with the severest halitosis, though they warned that concentrating so much rotting breath in one place could make the entire nation puke simultaneously."

"If I Die, Please Finish This Sandwich",10/31/07,3931,"It's never pleasant to think about, but the fact is, someday I will die. It's true that I am in relatively good health and should have many more wonderful years ahead of me. But it would be irresponsible of me not to be prepared for the worst. It's a dangerous world we're living in, and who knows what tomorrow will bring? Therefore, with a heavy heart, I must make my last wishes known. If I do pass on before my time, I beg of you, finish eating this sandwich. This may be difficult, but it's something that has to be done. As my friends and family—the people closest to me in the world—you've been with me through thick and thin, and I love each and every one of you. But I also love this sandwich, and if something happens to me before I am able to finish it, I want you to pick up where I left off: halfway through a delicious corned beef on rye. I realize this is a lot to ask. Many of you are busy with your own sandwiches or deli wraps, and it might seem impossible to leave your lunches behind and take care of my abandoned corned beef. Believe me, I plan to swallow every last bite of this piled-high wonder myself and maybe even move on to a brownie. But life doesn't care about plans. That's why I need you to promise me. Promise me you won't let a single ounce of this spicy brown mustard go to waste. Finish it while it's still warm and toasty, and I can rest in peace. I won't dwell on the awkward details about how the sandwich should be divided up among you. I just trust that, when the time comes, you'll know what to do. And it gives me comfort to think that I'll be watching over you from heaven, giving a little smile when you realize those chips are the nice Kettle ones. Such is my legacy to you. Sometimes I wonder how we got to this point. At 43, I shouldn't be thinking about what's going to happen to the remainder of this sandwich. I should be enjoying my home, my two beautiful daughters, and the delectable crunch of caraway seed meeting corned beef. But that's the reality of life in an unpredictable world. My father died of a heart attack at 68, and it was a terrible shock to all of us. And there was no will. He died right in the middle of a bowl of chili. I don't want to leave you with that kind of burden. I can't bear to think of you all standing around the kitchen, trying to figure out how to honor my memory. So I'm telling you right now, so there's no confusion: Eat this sandwich. All of it. Plus the pickle spear. There are a few specifics I need to go over pertaining to my last wishes, so there is a public record of them. While it may be hard to hear, it's even harder to say, but I think you'll all agree it is for the best. If I die from a sudden fatal stroke or a massive brain aneurysm while in mid-bite, there's a chance that I will still be clutching the sandwich. If this happens, you'll need to pry it out of my lifeless hands in order to finish eating it. Try to keep my mother out of the room when you do this, because it will be very hard for her to see. She's quite frail now that Dad's gone, and I'm worried about her heart. If, however, there is no apparent cause for my untimely death, it is imperative that you make sure to rule out ""poisoned sandwich"" before carrying out my last wishes. Look, there is absolutely no need to worry about me. I'm going to sit here and enjoy this perfectly stacked sandwich, eat these chips, and wash it all down with a cold beverage just like I do every Thursday at lunch. However, if—God forbid—something does happen and I'm unable to give this sandwich the proper eating it deserves, I need to know that someone will have the presence of mind to step over my corpse, consume the rest of this widowed sandwich, and wash it down with what's left of my Dr. Pepper before the ice melts and it gets all watery. Do this, and I shall be eternally indebted to you, as will my parents, my wife, and Mike at the Pump 'N Pay sandwich counter."
Small Change In Procedure Wendy's Manager's Crowning Achievement,10/25/07,851,"MERIDIAN, ID—Manager Duane Robert's 12-year career at Wendy's climaxed in a moment of triumph Tuesday, when his longtime condiment policy limiting the number of barbecue-sauce packets handed out to customers was given an official entry in the Florence Street franchise's employee manual. ""For years I've been saying three packs of BBQ sauce was too much,"" said Robert, standing proudly beside the salad bar in his freshly pressed yellow uniform. ""People would just throw out the third one or whip it at cars in the parking lot. But when I saw my words immortalized in print, right between the policy about tying up long hair and the procedure for changing the grease trap, I knew that my dream had been realized."" Impressed employees said Robert's decisive course of action would forever change how things are handed out at the drive-thru window area."
FDA: Juicy Green Apple Conditioner Best Used With Juicy Green Apple Shampoo,10/22/07,829,"WASHINGTON, DC—According to a warning issued by the Food and Drug Administration Monday, a generous amount of Suave Naturals Juicy Green Apple Conditioner should always be applied evenly and massaged into wet hair after washing with Suave Naturals Juicy Green Apple Shampoo. ""This is absolutely essential for optimal shine, shimmer, and texture,"" said FDA spokeswoman Linda Mergens, who urged Americans to grab the product off the shelves and buy it after health officials discovered that the shampoo contains vitamin E, which is crucial for bringing out the natural beauty in hair. ""Consumers should never under any circumstances mix Suave Naturals Juicy Green Apple Conditioner with Pert Plus, as it may impair luster."" The FDA also warned that failure to use the product properly could result in hair not smelling like apples."
New Heart Device Allows Cheney To Experience Love,10/03/07,4415,"WASHINGTON, DC—Recovering from minor heart surgery Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney stunned both the medical and political establishments when he mysteriously began to experience love for the first time in his life, sources reported Tuesday. It is believed to have been the first recorded incident of Cheney exhibiting compassion for his fellow man. Calling the vice president's sudden ability to love ""mystifying"" but a possible medical breakthrough that could aid other Americans who suffer from acute mulishness and generalized misanthropy, Dr. Jonathan Samuel Reiner, Cheney's cardiologist, said in a press conference at George Washington University Hospital that the vice president exhibited a series of unexpected side effects almost immediately after regaining consciousness following his surgery. ""The vice president broke free from the straps that secured him to the bed and lurched at me as he customarily does following a heart procedure,"" said Reiner. ""But instead of trying to strangle me, he wrapped his arms around me in a hug."" According to Reiner, Cheney left the hospital under his own power, but returned minutes later complaining of unfamiliar chest palpitations and sensations of warmth for others regardless of political affiliation or income. A test of the replacement defibrillator showed that the device was functioning properly, and an examination of Cheney revealed no physical abnormalities. ""The vice president's eyes had an unfamiliar gleam in them, and he didn't sound like his usual self at all, so we checked for signs of a stroke, but found none,"" Reiner said. ""His voice was atypically soft, and his hands felt warm to the touch."" Lynne Cheney, wife of the vice president, told reporters that her husband was ""doing fine"" upon release from the hospital, but acknowledged that he had exhibited some peculiar traits. ""When he came home, he did not characteristically stomp into the house and grumble about how the 'stupid American people should just be shot,'"" Mrs. Cheney said. ""Instead, he bent down to scratch the dog behind his ears instead of kicking him, and kissed me off-camera for the first time in 10 years."" Mrs. Cheney added she has not ruled out the possibility that her husband's blood- thinning medication may have been switched, unintentionally or not, with a CIA mind-control drug. Over the past two days, various White House and Capitol Hill sources have also reported bizarre behavior by the vice president. Cheney was back at work Monday, and, according to incredulous eyewitnesses, greeted each of his staff members by name. Later that afternoon, he canceled his regular weekly meeting with Halliburton executives, then kicked off his shoes, rolled up his pants, and strolled around barefoot on the White House lawn. Attending a Monday evening GOP fundraiser at the Washington Convention Center, Cheney was accompanied by David Gillian, 6, a young boy he had previously crippled, and by a small fawn who had followed him to the event. Mounting the podium as the featured speaker, he told supporters he had cast aside his planned speech on the counterinsurgency in Iraq's Anbar Province in order to ""tell the real truth."" ""If the events of Sept. 11 have taught us anything, it is this: We need to learn to love one another,"" Cheney said. ""We are all entwined in an unbreakable braid of human brotherhood. Each of us has something good and special to offer. If we work together, we can make the world into a most wonderful place where we can turn our attention to the truly important things, like snuggling."" During a C-SPAN-televised appearance at the Senate Tuesday, Cheney, in his role as Senate president, announced he had brought doughnuts for everyone, and encouraged the legislators to be more sensitive to one another's feelings. ""I've wasted so much of my life on a mindless quest for power and outright destruction,"" an increasingly emotional Cheney said. ""What about all the sunsets I've missed?"" ""What are these things you call 'tears'?"" added Cheney, as Senate ushers politely escorted him from the chamber. Despite his miraculous turnaround, doctors are calling Cheney's condition unstable and, if left untreated, possibly fatal. On Friday, Cheney will return to George Washington University Hospital to have the defibrillator removed, as it is feared that prolonged exposure to love could overwhelm his already shrunken and ulcerated black heart."
Over-Optimistic NFL Doctor Says Injured Bills Player Kevin Everett Will Fly Out Of Hospital,9/27/07,4168,"HOUSTON—Less than a month after Buffalo Bills tight end Kevin Everett suffered a life-threatening dislocation and fracture of his cervical spine that was predicted to leave him with permanent neurological damage, enthusiastic National Football League physicians attending him at Houston's Memorial Hermann hospital have announced that Everett will not only make a full recovery from injury, but will most likely gain the power of flight and soar out of the hospital under his own power. ""What we're seeing in Kevin's case is proof that the serious-injury recovery rate in pro football is nowhere near as serious as people have come to believe,"" Dr. Robert Homburg, a neurosurgeon assigned to Everett's case by the National Football League, said while pointing at the wings he had drawn on Everett's spinal X-rays. ""Not only will Kevin be able to walk out of the hospital, he actually won't have to, as he will heal so completely that he will be better than he was before and will almost certainly be able to fly out unassisted."" ""I don't think I'd be exaggerating Kevin's prognosis if I said we're looking at a 200% recovery here,"" Homburg added. Just days ago, physician Teodoro Castillo, Everett's original physician, said the injury was ""extremely severe"" but that healing was progressing surprisingly well, pointing to Everett's ability to sit up without difficulty and even move his right arm slightly as evidence that he might someday walk without difficulty. Upon being told of Homburg's claims, Castillo said the recovery would be a ""staged process of indeterminate length"" and that flying was almost certainly out of the question. ""While it's true I have treated few players with Kevin's level of physical conditioning and mental resilience, I don't think it's fair for the NFL's doctor to tell him that he'll be able to fly,"" Castillo said Wednesday. ""First of all, the trauma to his spinal cord was so extreme that we had to inject chilled saline into his body to induce healing. Second, no matter what Dr. Homburg says, people cannot just grow wings and fly, period, and to tell Kevin that is cruel. He probably won't even play football again."" Dr. Homburg said that, while he appreciated Castillo's cautious approach, he was only in partial agreement with his colleague. ""Sadly, I'm afraid it's true that Kevin will never play football again—the league cannot afford to give the Bills the sort of unfair competitive advantage a flying tight end would offer them,"" Homburg said. ""It's a lot like how Steve Young and Troy Aikman had to retire when their concussions gave them telekinesis and the power to stop time. Still, for Castillo to just dismiss the idea of Kevin's more-than-complete recovery out of hand is cynical and unprofessional. Like many injury-related issues, while it may be based on sound medical practices, it goes against everything the NFL is about."" ""Also, I should make it clear that I'm not saying Kevin will actually 'just grow wings and fly,'"" he added. ""It could be from magic, a rare form of spinal helicopter blades, or small jet boosters emerging from his feet. We have to keep an open mind about this."" Reactions to the news from around the league were mixed, with the NFL's front office sending Everett and Homburg their congratulations on his full recovery; players' union executive director Gene Upshaw saying that any further medical complications in Everett's case would be interpreted as the result of improper flight procedures and would result in the cancellation of his NFLPA benefits and pension, if any; and Everett's fellow Buffalo Bills players responding with a stunned silence born of disbelief and, presumably, joy. For his part, Everett is determined to stay positive. ""I'm just taking things one day at a time,"" Everett said from his hospital bed, where he is preparing to begin physical therapy and doing his best to ignore the multiple news reports about his injury. ""I heard that some league doctor had said some good things about me, and I guess that's nice. I'll walk out of this place, just you watch. But just between you and me, sometimes I think those NFL medical guys are a bunch of goddamn liars."""
Chinese Authorities Execute 10 Million Recalled Toys,9/24/07,4862,"BEIJING—In an attempt to assure the world's children that the millions of Chinese-made toys currently being recalled for containing toxic lead paint and tiny choking hazards can no longer hurt them, high-level Chinese officials announced Tuesday that millions of playthings are being rounded up and immediately put to death. ""We are committed to the well-being of children and putting the consumer's mind at ease,"" said Chinese president Hu Jintao at a press conference. ""Boys and girls of the world, you need not worry. Your toys will be executed swiftly and harshly. When we are through, there will be nothing left to play with."" In the past six weeks, Mattel Inc. has recalled more than 20 million toys from China that are believed to contain lead paint and other safety defects, a situation that prompted the Chinese government to send People's Liberation Army forces into major industrial sectors to mercilessly slaughter any remaining items that have not been exported for sale overseas. So far, an estimated 9 to 10 million toys, from anonymous dolls and miniature cars to trademarked characters such as Thomas the Tank Engine, Curious George, and Big Bird have been reportedly kicked, smashed with rifles, shocked with electric batons, hanged, and pounded with nails, before having their ears severed and eyes gouged out, and then being shot. ""Believe me when I say you can sleep peacefully tonight,"" said Hu, who reportedly gave troops direct orders to force thousands upon thousands of Polly Pocket dolls to their knees, point assault rifles at the backs of their heads, and blow their toxin-filled skulls to bits. ""We wish to reassure the world that we are taking care of this problem. We shall serve the young people."" Chinese toy manufacturers are reportedly complying with the government's wishes. According to the Xinhua News Agency, in the past three days alone, factory owners roused an estimated 365,000 Barbie dolls from their dream homes in a violent series of raids. During these raids, the Barbies were separated from their Kens, were stripped naked, and had their heads shaved. They were then taken to an undisclosed area, leaned against a wall because they were incapable of standing under their own power, and shot by a firing squad as toy soldiers were forced to watch. ""We are assisting the authorities in destroying toys,"" said Chen Hai, a senior manager at Joy Sing Industrial Plastics Co., a supplier contracted by several major American toy companies. ""This is not all talk. We invite any concerned American parents to come here and tour our toy torture chambers to see the toys' agony for themselves."" Chen added that, as a precaution, the factory also executed 5,000 workers. A toy-abuse-monitoring group, the Association for the Advancement of Plastic People (AAPP), said it has gathered evidence suggesting that the Chinese government has also detained an additional 20 million toys for questioning. According to the group, even toys that contained only trace levels of lead paint were loaded onto trains bound for detention centers in remote provinces of Western China, where they were allegedly deprived of sleep, burned with cigarettes, and subjected to traditional Chinese water torture. The AAPP also released video smuggled from an unidentified detention center showing Chinese intelligence officers attempting to extract information on the whereabouts of suspected lead-tainted toys from a Little Mommy Real Loving Baby Doll, despite the fact that she was capable only of asking for her bottle and playing peek-a-boo. The gruesome footage shows the doll's eyes being forcibly taped open and her lack of genitals being melted with a soldering iron. News of the crackdown is being received favorably by parents' organizations in the U.S. ""We're pleased the Chinese government is taking such an active and serious approach to the safety of toys,"" said Annelise Bow, director of the Brooklyn, NY—-based organization Our Children Come First. ""We hope that in the future any potential uprisings among dangerous playthings coming out of China will be crushed before they can spread to our toyboxes."" Minister of Commerce Bo Xilai said he hoped the mass toy-purges would ""send a strong message to our enemies who threaten to harm us with their dangerous chemical compounds."" ""Only by flaying Elmo's lethal skin, and wrenching Dora the Explorer's deadly limbs from her sockets and publicly displaying her body parts can we effectively warn toys never to jeopardize the livelihood of the people,"" Bo said. Government officials, however, still refused to confirm the whereabouts of Thomas the Tank Engine, rumored to have been splintered into pieces by attack dogs in Manchuria. Nor would it address allegations that hundreds of toy steam shovels in Guangdong Province were forced to dig their own graves before they were executed."
"Exhausted Doctor To Wake Up Early, Finish Surgery In Morning",9/20/07,606,"LOS ANGELES—Just moments after successfully stopping his patient's heart at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, bleary-eyed surgeon Dr. Dennis Kelly called it a night and decided to finish performing quadruple bypass surgery on Harold Cruz, 67, in the morning. ""Honestly, all these organs are looking the same to me right now,"" said Kelly, calling his mind ""complete mush."" ""I need to take a nice long breather and come back to this with fresh eyes."" Kelly said that he knew it was time to put aside the surgery when he caught himself attempting to re-harvest the exact same femoral vein he had removed 20 minutes earlier."
Scientists Isolate Area Of Brain That Doesn't Like Poking,9/14/07,742,"BETHESDA, MD—After an extensive six-month study using an electroencephalogram and a finger, researchers at the National Institutes of Health have discovered the section of the human brain that responds unfavorably to poking. ""We found a direct link between this negative effect and our finger pressing on a particular area of the brain,"" said neuroscientist Matthew Redman Monday, who conducted the study on 12 healthy participants. ""After analyzing our data and testing and retesting our subjects, we finally identified this region as the surface area of the brain."" Redman added that science has still barely scratched the surface of this intricate and fascinating organ, though he intends to keep doing so as soon as he receives his grant."
Study: Casual Sex Only Rewarding For First Few Decades,9/05/07,4001,"ARLINGTON, VA—An alarming new study published in the International Journal of Sexual Health reveals that casual sex, the practice of engaging in frequent, spontaneous sexual encounters with new and exciting partners, may only provide unimaginable pleasure and heart-pounding exhilaration for, at most, 25 to 30 years. ""People who choose to participate in random, no-strings-attached lovemaking sessions with sexually adventurous strangers should be advised that this type of behavior is only incredibly liberating for the first quarter-century or so,"" said Dr. Loren Sullivan of Yale University, who coauthored the study on the long-term side effects of living out one's wildest fantasies on a semi-weekly basis. ""Though sometimes it can be longer."" The study observed 100 sexually active volunteers who were not tied down by dull, passionless relationships and were therefore able to have sex with whomever they wanted, whenever they wanted. A control group of individuals who were married or had otherwise allowed their erogenous zones to fall into complete and utter numbness was also monitored for comparison. Researchers found that those who regularly achieved mind-blowing orgasms without the expectation of commitment often experienced mild feelings of loneliness and a passing regret after as little as three decades of pure physical bliss free of emotional complication. ""There's a troubling number of adults who spend their prime sexual years in complete coital abandon, then have nothing to show for it but dozens upon dozens of highly detailed erotic memories,"" Sullivan said. ""They must be so empty inside, one would think."" Other common, albeit latent, secondary effects noted in the study include mild disappointment and mid-afternoon crankiness, as well as a lingering need for additional casual sex. Researchers could not conclusively establish a link between anonymous, passionate trysts in nightclub bathrooms and these results, however, as a large portion of the polling group was found to be asymptomatic. One participant, California native Greg Pertzborn, told researchers he sometimes wonders if the 30 years he spent beneath a different gorgeous woman every night were worth the periodic flickers of gloominess he began experiencing at the age of 59. ""When I think back on the countless times I've had raw, almost bestial sex, indoors or outdoors, with one, sometimes two Asian women whose parents I'll never have to meet, I occasionally get a little down,"" Pertzborn said. ""God, what if I wasted my life having guilt-free, uninhibited, sensually explosive sex with anyone I wanted?"" Sullivan and his team plan to continue the study, saying they expect to find that the unattached, sexually satisfied persons between the ages of 20 and 30 whom they have been monitoring will feel compelled to settle down with a single partner and begin discussing joint checking accounts ""any day now."" ""Tragically, it's quite possible that many of these singles may never realize how miserable a lifetime of phenomenal, kinky sex can make them,"" said Sullivan, adding that recent evidence suggests such a healthy, rational realization could be further hindered by the experience of spontaneous oral sex behind the bushes at poolside cocktail parties. Although the study has not yet caused any perceptible reduction in the popularity of having casual sex, proponents of the report, like husband and father-of-four Howard Kehoe, say it provides proof that promiscuity is not ""the endless carnal thrill-ride"" it is often made out to be. ""I am so thankful that I never acted on my natural impulses and engaged in a sweaty, toe-curling, life-affirming romp with that knockout I saw in the park last week,"" Kehoe said. ""I may die having only caressed the naked, goose-pimpled flesh of two women on the entire planet, including my wife, but at least I know I'll never have to endure a burst of fleeting regret long after I've retired."" ""That's one sensation I never want to experience,"" Kehoe added."
FDA Approves Seconds,8/22/07,3309,"WASHINGTON, DC—In a surprising reversal of its longtime single-helping policy, the Food and Drug Administration announced its approval of seconds Tuesday, claiming that an additional plateful of food with every meal can greatly reduce the risk of hunger as well as provide an excellent source of deliciousness. Addressing what it calls a ""growing epidemic of cravings and hankerings,"" the federal agency recommended redesigning food labels to prominently display extra-serving sizes and pledged to better educate consumers on how to make informed additional-portion choices at home and in restaurants. ""There's plenty to go around,"" FDA commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach said between spoonfuls of mashed potatoes during a benefit luncheon at the Clean Plate Club in Washington. ""We've found that eating seconds is essential for keeping up the country's strength."" ""Besides, with people starving in other parts of the world, it would be an absolute shame to let our nice food supply all go to waste,"" the commissioner added. Once restricted to the head of the household, on Thanksgiving, or to those who had been extra good, seconds will now be made available to the general public in over-the-kitchen-counter form. However, FDA officials warn that those with a history of health problems should consult their doctor first. ""Seconds may not be suitable for everyone,"" von Eschenbach said. ""Especially those who suffer from heart disease, those at risk for diabetes, people trying to lose weight, and women."" The FDA also recommended moderation in consuming seconds. Researchers in the seconds field have noted occasional side effects, such as hardly being able to get up from the table, pants-loosening, drowsiness, and the feeling that one ""might explode"" if one eats just one more bite. A report commissioned by the Las Vegas–based International Brotherhood of Buffet Owners revealed that 75 percent of undereating occurs in those afflicted by a rare disorder in which their eyes are smaller than their stomachs, preventing them from taking advantage of all-you-can-eat opportunites. Picky eating habits and an unwillingness to stuff oneself are considered the leading preventable causes of scrawniness among Americans. ""Growing boys represent the greatest at-risk group, as unprecedented numbers of them are wasting away,"" registered dietician and grandmother of six Irma Jacobs said. ""They'll just turn into skin and bones before our very eyes unless we make a concerted effort to get them to eat, eat, eat up."" Other nutritionists suggest that the need for seconds could be eliminated by an initial very large, or ""heaping,"" helping. ""Larger portions could entirely eliminate the need to reach over, pass dishes, or get out of a chair,"" said clinical nutritionist Gary Bergen of Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who estimates that millions of calories and thousands of hours of eating time are wasted annually by making unnecessary second-serving trips. ""I find it ironic that the FDA has approved seconds, yet still hasn't standardized the dollop."" Despite months of work and the purchase of several new wardrobes, FDA researchers say their study of the consumption of thirds and fourths has been inconclusive, but they suggest a possible link between these additional servings and tummy aches."
In The Know: Should We Be Shaming Obese Children More?,8/09/07,127,Our panelists discuss whether taunting and insults would be an effective strategy to help America's obese children lose weight.
Tragic Event Forces Man To Spend Rest Of Life Confined To Office Chair,8/04/07,3315,"WILMETTE, IL—The life of recent college graduate Jeremy Fahey was forever changed earlier this month when the once outgoing and carefree student succumbed to a job offer at a local insurance claims firm, an unforeseen and tragic event that will most likely keep him confined to an office chair for the rest of his life. While many details remain unclear, it is now believed that Fahey lost any and all upward mobility moments after being hired for a data entry position at Sedgwick Enterprises on the morning of July 25. According to several eyewitnesses at the scene, the impact of Fahey's full-time employment was so sudden and crushing that it has left the former high school track star paralyzed in front of his work computer screen ever since. ""You hear stories about it all the time, but you never think that something like this is going to happen to you,"" said Fahey, who now spends most days trapped inside a windowless cubicle, and only leaves his office chair in order to use the bathroom. ""It's funny: One minute you have your entire future ahead of you, and the next thing you know, you practically need someone to drag you out of bed in the morning."" Due to Fahey's condition, simple, everyday tasks such as grocery shopping, walking his dog, or even just cleaning up after himself have become virtually impossible feats. In addition, Fahey admitted that he has been forced to abandon a number of his favorite activities, from jogging in the park to just kicking his feet up and watching daytime television. Fahey, who claims to have lost ""all sense of purpose"" due to this harrowing turn of events, is already finding it difficult to remember a time when he ""didn't feel completely numb."" ""People keep telling me that it's going to get easier, that I won't always be stuck in this position, but right now, every minute of every day is a struggle,"" Fahey said. In recent weeks, Fahey has also found himself requiring the aid of various stimulants and drugs, such as caffeine, sugar, and even alcohol, just to get through the day. Worse yet, those close to the once lively 22-year-old report that he has become almost entirely dependent on computers to communicate with those around him. ""I realize that what happened to Jeremy is nobody's fault, but still I sometimes wish I could have my old buddy back,"" said longtime friend Derrick Hodge, who recently visited Jeremy in his cubicle. ""At first I tried pretending like nothing had changed, but every time I looked at him all I could see was that…that chair."" News of Fahey's debilitating employment has left his loved ones shocked and feeling helpless. ""Jeremy had such a bright future—he could have gone on to do anything he wanted,"" said Michelle Fahey, who claimed that she almost didn't recognize her brother. ""To see him like this now, in that button-down dress shirt and those pleated slacks, it's almost too much to bear."" ""He didn't deserve this,"" she added. ""Nobody deserves this."" While Fahey has often thought about quitting for good, one thing has kept him going through it all. ""Sometimes I imagine what a relief it would be if I just gave up all together, if I never had to deal with another weekday ever again,"" Fahey said. ""But then I think about my school loans and my credit card debt, and I know I have no choice but to keep going."""
Counselors Quarantine Homesick Campers,7/31/07,817,"CAMP WALLALONGABANKA, MN—Counselors at Wallalongabanka  Sleep-Away Camp say a potentially dangerous outbreak of homesickness has been contained in Mallard Cabin, where campers infected by ""sudden acute attacks of missing their parents"" were safely quarantined Saturday before the disease could spread. ""We believe the disease arrived in a box of homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, which we have since isolated,"" said Mallard Cabin group leader Mike Essl, who oversaw the 2002 treatment of a campfire ghost story–related outbreak of the heebie-jeebies. ""Once you see the first couple of chins quivering, you gotta hustle them off quick to the cabin furthest from the craft shack."" Essl confirmed that the bodies of the four campers who succumbed to the homesickness outbreak were incinerated according to CDC guidelines."
AMA: Plastic Surgery 'Only A Few Years Away' From Making Someone Look Better,7/19/07,911,"NEW YORK—American Medical Association spokeswoman Dr. Marlene German told reporters at a press conference Tuesday that, after nearly a half-century of advancements in the field, doctors are now only ""a few years away"" from being able to make patients look better, rather than worse, following plastic surgery. ""Soon, a person will leave the hospital with an appearance that is younger, healthier, and more attractive, instead of looking like some horrific, pinch-faced thing from another world,"" German said. ""We thank the hundreds of thousands of plastic surgery patients who have helped us get to this point. Without trial and error, and the inevitable freakish failures that result, there could be no progress."" Following the announcement, women nationwide made appointments for second and third plastic surgery procedures, hoping that the new techniques might eventually help them look halfway normal again."
Health Department Closes Perfectly Good Burrito Place,6/30/07,3781,"COLUMBUS, OH—The Columbus Health Department closed the Mexican fast food restaurant Burrito Max on Monday after it failed a routine inspection, completely neglecting to take into account  the fact that the popular, conveniently located establishment was a perfectly good burrito place that served kick-ass burritos at a totally cheap price. ""The food there was just fine,"" said bike messenger Seth Sherwood, 25, adding that he ""almost never got sick"" after eating at Burrito Max. ""This is bullshit. I bet those health guys have never even tried one of their Grande Texas Chili Extremes."" According to a report filed by city food-safety inspector Dan Griffith, Burrito Max, a cheap, no-frills eatery that never aspired to be anything it wasn't, had a handful of very small, practically insignificant health-code violations, such as vermin on the premises, a persistent foul odor, traces of E. coli, and unsanitary food-contact surfaces and equipment—like what restaurant in this city doesn't. The report, however, did not mention the restaurant's free drink refills and the signature chili-cheese fries, which, according to restaurant regulars, were ""awesome."" ""If those guys got a bad burrito, they should have just asked for another one instead of writing the place up like a bunch of little bitches,"" said Ohio State University sophomore Greg Hall, 19, who, like a lot of customers, didn't absolutely love the food, but found it more than serviceable, especially during lunch, after bar time, or when he was craving a burrito. ""If they really want to help me out, here's an idea: They could open up another burrito place, keep it open until 4 a.m., and call it Burrito Max."" Though the report cited the employees' habit of not wearing hairnets or shirts and showing up to work ""in a generally unhygienic state,"" it overlooked the fact that the heavily pierced and tattooed staff added to the authentic, laid-back atmosphere of Burrito Max. Most importantly, the place served solid, hearty,  burritos fast and hot, something most burrito joints in the area do not. In addition, the line to order was never too long. ""I didn't go to Burrito Max because it was clean,"" copy shop assistant Rachael Grimaldi, 26, said. ""I went because my friends worked there, the tofu burrito was cheap, and they had a bike rack outside the front entrance."" Had health department officials bothered to interview Burrito Max's patrons, they would have learned these things, rather than just dwelling on the dirty floors—which people don't eat off of, last time anyone checked—and the consistently out-of-order bathroom with the hilarious ""Fuck You"" carved into the ""Employees Must Wash Hands"" sign. ""I'm sure the risk of food-borne illnesses wasn't as big a deal as they made it out to be,"" said 24-year-old legal assistant Deirdre Sarnoff upon hearing that the restaurant's poultry and beef were stored at improper temperatures. ""It's not like I ever bit into a cockroach or anything. Where am I supposed to eat now, some overpriced corporate burrito chain like Chipotle?"" ""Christ,"" Sarnoff added. ""It seems like every time I find a cheap place that's open past midnight the stupid city comes along and shuts it down."" Burrito Max is not the only local eatery to be unfairly shuttered by the Health Department in recent months. In March, Cecilia's Pizza was shut down for rat feces and a lack of properly covered waste receptacles, despite its sweet $3.99 deal that included two slices of cheese pizza and a medium drink. Two weeks ago, the Indian Buffet, located in the basement of an apartment building on 595 Commonwealth Ave., was closed for unsanitary conditions, though, according to patrons, the food quality was ""still pretty decent"" even after the big grease fire they had there last August."
Asthmatic Child Tired Of Hearing List Of Famous Asthmatics,6/28/07,714,"LEXINGTON, PA—Thirteen-year-old asthmatic Nate Bothman told reporters Monday that his mother's penchant for telling him about famous asthmatics is totally unnecessary, as he has already figured out that he can live a normal and fulfilling life with the respiratory ailment. ""My mom says if I use my inhaler like I'm supposed to, I can be just like Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, or [Roman statesman and philosopher] Seneca, but I really couldn't care less,"" said Bothman, who expressed similar indifference to the fact that director Martin Scorsese, Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and actress Morgan Fairchild also have the disease. ""Actually, being told Billy Joel has asthma made me feel even worse about it."""
"Half Of Nation Outraged At New, Not-Yet-Released Michael Moore Film",6/18/07,834,"WASHINGTON, DC—Though the film isn't scheduled for release until June 29, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that nearly half the nation believes Michael Moore's new health care documentary Sicko is ""unpatriotic,"" ""disgusting,"" and ""ill-informed."" ""This film is absolutely tasteless and misguided, and I can't believe theaters are even showing it,"" said GOP presidential candidate Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS), who, along with the rest of the nation, has not yet seen the film. ""I thought the role of a documentary filmmaker was to be objective, but moviegoers are going to leave the theater thinking that there is something wrong with some part of the United States, and that is just flat-out untrue."" The other half of the nation has praised Sicko, calling it a ""real eye-opener"" that would ""challenge people's preconceived notions."""
Single Bee Sends Gathering Of Humans Into Helpless Panic,6/16/07,3055,"DALLAS—A western honeybee measuring barely one-quarter of an inch in length and weighing approximately .03 ounces triggered panic among a gathering of six fully-grown Homo sapiens during a picnic at Davis Park on Monday, witnesses reported. ""Where is it—where is it?"" said 44-year-old general manager Charles Freid, who has been described by his coworkers and business rivals as  ""ruthless,"" after the bee happened to fly in his general direction. ""Get it off me! Is it on me?"" ""Jesus!"" added Freid, screaming and flailing his arms as he raced to his car, got inside, and locked the doors. The college-educated humans, all of whom are not allergic to bee-sting venom and possess both cerebral and muscular capacities several orders of magnitude beyond that of the insect, proceeded to retreat in abject fright from its half-millimeter stinger, which, when used, causes a twinge of discomfort followed by mild irritation and kills the bee. According to entomologists at the University of Texas at Dallas, the Apis mellifera was most likely trying to pollinate a nearby cluster of dandelions and was not, as alleged by 50-year-old attorney Georgia Sakko, who has twice endured the pain of childbirth and successfully battled breast cancer, ""out to get us."" ""Don't make it angry—don't make it angry!"" Sakko said. ""Is it in my hair? I feel something in my hair. Somebody get it out. Get it out!"" Airline pilot Mike Grunwold, 49, who is approximately 1,224 times the size of the bee, said that he was ""certain"" the bee had landed on Sakko's back. Fiber tests on Sakko's clothing later found no traces of a bee's presence, but did reveal a small piece of lint and matted hair that may have resembled an insect at a distance and in certain lights. Civil engineer, marathon runner, and Gulf War veteran Scott Fogel, 39, briefly attempted to use force against the bee's non-aggressive actions, waving it away with a paper plate. After accidently upending a container of potato salad, which caused the bee to suddenly swerve, Fogel leaped back several feet and dashed for cover behind a trash can. ""They're attracted to sweat,"" Fogel said. ""It makes them want to kill. Just try to keep as far away from it as you can."" After the bee seemingly disappeared, the humans—members of a species that has crossed an Ice Age land bridge from Asia to North America, domesticated the wolf, built the pyramids, and landed a manned vehicle on the surface of the moon—walked cautiously back to the picnic area. ""I think it's gone,"" personal trainer Marcus Weller, 32, said. ""Thank God."" A few seconds later, the bee emerged from an overturned Coke can, prompting the humans to scream and retreat once more. They opted not to return to the area, abandoning several hundred dollars' worth of food and picnicking equipment. The brutalized parkgoers characterized the day as ""totally ruined."" The bee, which was reportedly never more than vaguely aware of the presence of other living organisms besides the blooming plants it sought, eventually returned to its hive without incident."
Davey Gendelman Hits Puberty,6/13/07,3541,"WHITFORD, NJ—After several months of observation and interviews with nearly everyone in the young teen's life, an Onion investgation has conclusively determined that Whitford seventh grader David ""Davey"" Gendelman, 13, is presently undergoing the bodily changes that will slowly transform his awkward, boyish frame into that of a sexually mature adult. Despite repeated denials from the transparently defensive Gendelman, members of his peer group told reporters that the Whitford native now experiences spontaneous erections throughout the day. The majority of these occur during third-period social studies class, in which he sits behind classmate Sarah Miller, also 13, and stares desperately at the bra straps visible under her tank top. Several handwritten poems discovered during a search of Gendelman's school locker identify Miller as the secret object of his budding affections. When informed of her classmate's sexual interest in her underwear, Miller called Gendelman ""perverted and gross."" The boy's penis, although still tiny compared to those of most boys his age, is becoming erect at other times as well, including in the hallway between classes, on the school bus, and at lunch, an analysis of school security-camera footage confirmed. Gendelman has been observed carrying textbooks and other objects directly in front of his midsection in an ineffective attempt to conceal his blood-engorged member from his peers. Whitford Middle School nurse Kristin Price initially declined to comment on Gendelman's drastically changing body, citing confidentiality issues. However, notes obtained from Price's office revealed that the middle schooler visited her less than two weeks ago to ask a number of questions about the female reproductive system—a clear sign that hormones have begun to rage through his young body. Gym class sources eagerly disclosed that the loner's ""squeaky, childlike"" voice now often cracks, and that Gendleman has recently developed body odor, leading to frequent instances of his ""smelling nasty."" Though the signs of his puberty have become increasingly obvious, those closest to the 13-year-old were hesitant to speak to the news media about his transformation. His mother, Janice, had to be confronted with the results of a six-week examination of her family's laundry before admitting to reporters that the boy has begun to experience the nocturnal emissions of semen commonly known as ""wet dreams."" Gendelman's father, Frank, expressed surprise when he was shown pictures of women exposing their vaginas and told that they were recovered using the browser history on his family's personal computer. ""Apparently, he doesn't know about the 'delete history' function,"" Frank Gendelman said. ""He may be growing up, but he's still naïve in so many ways."" Interviews with more popular students in the school's locker room further confirmed Gendelman's budding pubescence. The larger boys revealed that despite ""acting like a little baby all the time"" and ""playing basketball like a girl,"" Gendelman has finally sprouted a slight growth of ""peach fuzz"" on his genitalia—a trait that has even earned him the derisive and humiliating nickname ""Peach Fuzz Gendelman"" among his gym class peers. Gendelman himself could not be reached for comment on this story, as he was locked in the family bathroom using the suction created after taking the top off of his mother's conditioner bottle, squeezing the air out of it, and placing his penis against the opening to simulate what he imagines oral sex to feel like."

"Shaking Off Amnesia, Gonzales Remembers He's Actually Pool Salesman From Tulsa",6/11/07,3585,"WASHINGTON, DC—Embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' future was thrown further into jeopardy Friday when he was accidentally struck by a boom microphone, reversing a years-long case of amnesia and causing him to remember his true identity as hotshot Tulsa, OK pool and spa salesman ""Cabana Al"" Gonzales. ""My God, what am I doing here?"" a dazed Gonzales asked reporters in what they assured him was indeed his office. ""The last thing I remember is slipping on some wet redwood decking out by the Boswicks' 16-by-48-foot in-ground El Tropico—beautiful pool, that one, with a hefty seven-percent commission attached—and then suddenly I'm waking up three years older, 25 pounds heavier, and defending my actions in the firing of eight federal prosecutors. Somebody has obviously made a really big mistake."" ""Clearly, I should not be seventh in line for the presidency,"" Gonzales said. ""Can I go home now?"" After being informed of the details of his recent legal career, including his opinion that the writ of habeas corpus is not represented in the Constitution and that law enforcement officers do not in fact need warrants to listen to phone calls made by private citizens, Gonzales expressed regret over ""whatever it was [he] did"" and apologized to anyone he may have inconvenienced by his actions over the past three years. White House doctors say Gonzales' amnesia seems to have been completely eradicated, leaving him dazed, shaken, and unable to explain how he became the chief law enforcement  officer  of the federal government. ""Law never really interested me much,"" Gonzales said. ""Got a brother-in-law who's a lawyer. Sold him a pool, actually. But that's it."" Archived footage from Tulsa local television found by Senate investigators shows him in several local commercials touting ""Cabana Al"" as ""the pool salesman Tulsa trusts"" as late as November 2004, mere days before Bush announced he would nominate Gonzales to succeed John Ashcroft for Bush's second term. Furthermore, voluntarily taken polygraph tests indicate that Gonzales has absolutely no idea how he came to be placed in his current job, where he is in charge of a $40 billion budget and more than 110,000 employees. ""Why the hell would anyone appoint me, of all people, to this position?"" Gonzales asked. ""All I know about law is a couple of local Tulsa zoning ordinances restricting how big a pool you can put in various-sized suburban lots. Hey, I didn't change any of those while I…when you all thought I was…. No? Man, what a shame."" The Senate has decided against holding a no-confidence vote on Gonzales, as those who opposed the attorney general believe their point has been made, and those who supported him acknowledge that he himself is pleading to be excused from duties so that he can return to the greater Tulsa area as soon as possible. ""It's already full-blown summer, and if I'm going to sell any in-ground units this year I have to start digging by the end of June or they won't be ready until September almost, and the commission on above-ground stuff is just pathetic,"" Gonzales told Congress. The attorney general has so far rejected Bush's offers to strike him upon the head in an attempt to reverse his sudden, unexpected amnesia cure and restore him to his former mental state. On the advice of counsel, all of whom, it has been verified, are actual lawyers, Gonzales has said he will not comment further on White House business, except to say that, if the president is interested, he could hook him up with a good deal on a three-season heated ""Olympia model"" for the Rose Garden."
Study: Many Americans Too Fat To Commit Suicide,6/08/07,3847,"LOS ANGELES—A report published Monday in The New England Journal of Medicine warns that the nation's obesity epidemic has reached a new level of crisis, with many overweight Americans' increased girth rendering them physically unable to end their own, fat lives. ""We've known for some time that obesity can cause heart disease, diabetes, strokes, and other potentially life-threatening illnesses,"" said report author Dr. Marjorie Reese, director of UCLA's Obesity Pathology Clinic. ""But the fact that obesity impedes suicide is truly troubling. It appears that the more reason people have to die, the less capable they are of doing so. They are literally trapped in their grotesque, blubbery bodies."" Of the one-third of Americans classified as obese, the report estimated 29 percent are too heavy, immobile, or both for suicide to be a viable option. This figure is up from 18 percent in 1996. A full 70 pages of the report focus on suicide methods that are taken for granted by persons of normal weight but often present insurmountable challenges to their corpulent counter- parts. For example, hanging oneself is most often out of the question. The report notes that a disturbing percentage of the obese are too large to ascend a footstool, too inflexible to kick it out from under them, and even if they could, are too heavy to remain atop it long enough to put their giant, flabby necks through a noose before the footstool shatters into splinters under their massive girth. Plus, as Reese writes, ""even if all other variables were eliminated, the weight of these enormous individuals would probably break any indoor light fixtures or attic roof supports to which they might tie a rope."" Overdosing on narcotics is also impossible, according to Reese. ""Body fat absorbs toxins, so fat people simply cannot ingest enough bottles of sleeping pills to have any effect, much less stop their hearts,"" Reese said. ""And slitting one's wrists in the bathtub is not an option if you can't find a butcher knife thick enough to reach the arteries under your rolls of wrist flab, or can't fit into the bathtub in the first place. All the self-loathing in the world is not going to help the obese get their meaty index fingers through the trigger guard, nor give them the flexibility to raise the pistol to their head. It's heartbreaking."" The report included detailed illustrations of extremely overweight people unable to bend over far enough to fit their heads into ovens, bobbing like corks while attempting to drown themselves, and becoming too winded scaling stairs to reach heights from which they could hurl their enormous bulk with fatal results. Another researcher at the Obesity Pathology Clinic has developed a computer model which demonstrates that even if the obese were able to jump off a skyscraper, their bodies would be ""more likely to bounce than splat."" Yet health experts say that there is hope for these hulking individuals. ""The fat need to improve their eating habits and commit to a modest exercise regimen, even if it starts with just walking from room to room inside their houses,"" said Dianne Evans, a specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health. ""If they keep that up for six to 12 months, most of these people could lose enough weight to be able to kill themselves with relative ease."" But Evans warned that losing too much weight too fast could have serious repercussions. ""What you want to avoid is a situation where someone comes down from 320 pounds to 240 in the span of a single year, and suddenly does not have the suicidal urges they once did,"" said Evans, who explained that the ""sweet spot"" of self-hatred and physical suicidal ability is extremely small. ""If they mistake their all-but-meaningless improvement for a legitimate reason to live, their fat, revolting lives may be prolonged indefinitely."""

Dog Breeders Issue Massive Recall Of '07 Pugs,5/23/07,3441,"WASHINGTON, DC—Citing centuries of quality- control issues that have resulted in chronic unreliability, cascading system failures, and even total unit shutdown, the American Pug Breeders Association announced a recall Monday of all pugs produced between February 2006 and the present day. ""We apologize wholeheartedly to any and all owners of the 2007 pug,"" APBA director Betty McAndrews said at a press conference, standing before a table where 10 defective pugs were displayed. ""While pug owners are accustomed to dog malfunction, the latest animals are prone to more problems than just the usual joint failures, overheating, seizures, chronic respiratory defects, and inability to breed without assistance. The latest model pug is simply not in any way a viable dog."" According to the APBA's online recall notice, pugs produced in the specified period are at ""moderate to high risk"" for convulsive respiratory failure, soft palate suppuration, corneal ulcers leading to sudden deliquescence of the eyeballs, catastrophic lung collapse, ingrown ribs, diabetes, patellar luxation, encephalitis, Lou Gehrig's pug's disease, impacted hips, neck dysplasia, tracheal fissures, morbid obesity, cranial arthritis, and leakage of the anal sacs. In addition, due to strong allergic reactions to almost all medications, 97 percent of pugs are untreatable. [slideshow:61936] This week, the APBA has begun to send out recall information and cardboard mailing boxes to registered pug owners, who are asked to place their '07 pug inside the box, seal it, and, if they wish, punch air holes in the top and sides. Owners must then put the box inside an airtight heavy-duty plastic bag, affix a postage-paid mailing label, and drop it off at any U.S. post office. In order to ensure that all '07 pugs are taken out of circulation, the organization is also providing a complimentary on-site disposal service to pug owners who are otherwise unable to participate in the recall. ""We'd prefer to destroy all units here at our headquarters—we already have the chimneys going day and night,"" McAndrews said. ""But the very young and the very old seem rather reluctant to send in their pugs, despite all of their well-documented flaws. To protect our reputation as pug breeders, we're going to spend the next month visiting individual homes and putting these dogs out of everyone's misery."" For Mason City, IA pug owner Lee Kraus, the APBA's announcement comes as a complete vindication after years of contending with defective pugs. In the past five years alone, Kraus has attempted to return three of the dogs to his local breeder, and each time has been denied either a refund or an exchange for a more reliable make, such as a Shih Tzu. ""I'm glad to see the APBA is finally taking responsibility for this disaster,"" Kraus said. ""Governor Fattpants gave me insomnia with his constant snorting, and Boiler ruined my bedroom set when he went into total renal shutdown."" Cindy Anderson of the Sarasota, FL–based Pug Owners Group shares Kraus's frustration with the highly developed breed. ""After trying and failing to nurse Princess Kevin through hemorrhagic lupus and Boatsley through a hysterical tubal pregnancy, I don't know if I'll ever own another pug,"" Anderson said. ""It's not worth the hassle."" ""Oh, who am I kidding? They're just so cute!"" she added. ""I love their adorable snorting and their funny little waddle. We're going to call our next one Lopez."""
Study: 38 Percent Of People Not Actually Entitled To Their Opinion,5/23/07,1086,"CHICAGO—In a surprising refutation of the conventional wisdom on opinion entitlement, a study conducted by the University of Chicago's School for Behavioral Science concluded that more than one-third of the U.S. population is neither entitled nor qualified to have opinions. ""On topics from evolution to the environment to gay marriage to immigration reform, we found that many of the opinions expressed were so off-base and ill-informed that they actually hurt society by being voiced,"" said chief researcher Professor Mark Fultz, who based the findings on hundreds of telephone, office, and dinner-party conversations compiled over a three-year period. ""While people have long asserted that it takes all kinds, our research shows that American society currently has a drastic oversupply of the kinds who don't have any good or worthwhile thoughts whatsoever. We could actually do just fine without them."" In 2002, Fultz's team shook the academic world by conclusively proving the existence of both bad ideas during brainstorming and dumb questions during question-and-answer sessions."
Jesus Is My Health Insurance,5/23/07,3236,"I tell you, people these days have lost their faith. Everybody’s turning to the television or drugs or the government to solve their problems, when they should be trusting in the Lord. Why, just the other day I went to County General because my legs were giving me awful pains, and this nurse starting asking me questions about providers and what was my health care plan and wanting my insurance card so she could copy it. I said, “Child, I don’t need all that fancy paperwork—not as long as I have Jesus in my heart.” No matter what sorts of hardships and illnesses life throws my way, I always count on the Lord to oversee my managed care. So I told that nurse to send my bills right up to heaven. Send them right on up, because Jesus is my preferred provider and He always grants me full coverage. After all, Jesus believed in healing the sick and helping the poor, so He most definitely believes in paying my doctor bills on time. The Son of God doesn’t screen for pre- existing conditions, and the only requirement for coverage is that you accept Him into your life. There is no deductible with the Lord, and every doctor, clinic, and hospital is in His network. As long as I get down on my knees and submit my claims every night, Jesus will accept them. Even though Peter denied Him three times in a single night, He never denies me, no matter how many ovarian cysts and respiratory infections I might develop.
 As long as I place my $10 weekly premium in the Holy Redeemer collection plate every Sunday, my spirit is full with the Lord. He maketh me lie down in green pastures, leadeth me beside the still waters, and covereth hospital stays for up to 90 days per benefit period. Unlike many earthly health plans, the Lord’s benefit summary is endless. It includes full vision and ambulance and X-rays. Hemodialysis, infertility treatment, dental, and gynecological exams are also included, as well as physical and occupational therapy. And well-baby and well-child care is covered too, including immunizations and hearing tests. For additional benefits details, consult your Bible. But best of all, Jesus’ plan is the only one that covers the greatest health benefit of all: everlasting life. Yes, indeed—the Lord primary-care provides. Now, I remember the days when I was all alone in the world. Until I found the Lord, I was consumed with fear because my heart problems were getting worse and I had to be on these special pills and I couldn’t afford regular insurance with my hotel housekeeping job. That’s when I discovered that Jesus’ emer- gency room accepts everybody. No lines, no waiting, no forms to fill out. He lifts my soul but never my rates. Oh, once in a while those folks from P & H Collection Agency come calling, but I know it’s just Jesus testing me. For I know that just as He delivered Lazarus from the tomb, the Lord will deliver me from the $80,000 in unpaid medical costs on my billing statement. Today, I just give myself to the Lord and know that He will always provide a substantial portion of my net health-care costs for non-elective surgeries and routine office visits. And with the Holy Spirit as my death and dismemberment policy, my next of kin will one day reap the riches of heaven. Praise be."

Christ Getting In Shape For Second Coming,4/04/07,4103,"HEAVEN—Emerging from a grueling 90 minutes of cardiovascular exercise and light lifting for tone, Son of God Jesus Christ said Monday that He is ""definitely on track"" to achieve peak fitness condition for the Second Coming.  ""If every eye is going to see Me, and all the tribes of earth are going to wail on account of  Me, I think I owe it to them and to Myself to be in the best shape of My life,"" Christ said. ""Right now I'm up to 35 minutes at seven [miles per hour] on the treadmill and benching about 165 [pounds]."" ""I'm really starting to feel like I'll have the strength and endurance to move every mountain and island from its place,"" Christ added. Since His birthday last Dec. 25, Christ has committed Himself to a demanding daily regimen of exercise and prophecy fulfillment. Each of His workouts, Christ said, starts with an hour of cardio, after which He focuses on two muscle groups, replacing conventional free weights with the Rod of Iron with which He intends to rule all nations. On Mondays, Christ works His chest and biceps and completes three sets of 10 transfigurations. On Tuesdays, He switches to triceps and abdominals, and passes as many sets of Last Judgments as He can in a minute. Wednesdays are devoted to the back and legs, and Thursdays and Fridays are for core and flexibility.  Even Sabbaths are spent doing yoga, swimming, and basic strength-training isometrics such as push-ups, leg lifts, and chin-ups.  ""There can be no day of rest,""  said Christ, His eyes filled with flaming fire. ""Rest is for mortals."" The determined Savior has also forsworn His favorite high-calorie, high-carb foods such as fatted calf, loaves, and even His own body and blood, instead embracing muscle-building high-protein shakes and electrolyte-replacing sports drinks. And when temptation calls, Christ need only look at two pictures taped to His refrigerator: an icon of Himself prior to starting His regimen and a reproduction of Michelangelo's ""Last Judgment"" fresco torn from a magazine. ""The thought of being unable to seize the seven-headed serpent and hurl it into the abyss really keeps Me motivated,"" Christ said. The Lamb of God said He made the decision to get in shape late last year when, after two millennia of relative inactivity, He realized that at His age there was ""no way"" He could return to Earth, judge the souls of the innocent and wicked alike, and reign over the Kingdom of God for 1,000 years without prior conditioning. ""The Second Coming isn't just Me sitting on a great white throne and judging away,"" Christ said. ""I also have to make all of the stars fall and shake all the powers in Heaven. That's why I've been working a lot with the medicine ball."" Christ, however, admitted that centuries of heavenly grace had enabled Him to ""really let [Himself] go."" ""I can't lead the armies of Heaven looking like some flabby slob,"" said Christ, who declined to disclose His ""before"" weight. ""That guy can't be the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. The faithful want a Messiah they can truly fear, not someone who's afraid to take off His shirt in public."" At first, Christ said He thought such a physical transformation would ""take a miracle."" During the first couple weeks of His exercise program, He couldn't work out on the treadmill for more than 10 minutes without gasping for breath and aggravating the old spear-point injury in His side. Now that He can deftly complete 20 ab-bench push-ups on the highest incline and almost as many chin-ups, Christ said, He feels more energetic than He has since His early 30s. And not only has frequent exercise made Christ feel more healthy and confident, it's ""cleared [His] head, which will really help [Him] deal with the massive amount of smiting and condemning."" Encouraged by His progress, particularly the increased definition in His pectoral and abdominal muscles, Christ is focusing all of His attention on visualizing the success of His Second Coming. ""Right now, it's all about Aug. 2,"" the goal-oriented Savior said. ""And no matter how I look, there's no going back on this one like I did seven years ago."""

Ain't Nobody Telling Me What My Baby Allergic To,3/28/07,4464,"So yesterday some bitch nurse at the clinic was wasting my time trying to tell me my baby Liondrae all allergic to penicillin or some shit. I don't know what kind of made-up bullshit that is. She probably, like, said it just to come off all important. Besides, who asked her to tell me what 'Drae allergic to anyway? I only brought him to the clinic 'cause that cut on his arm he got trying to climb the chain-link fence behind our apartment got all nasty and green and shit. They jabbed his arm up with penicillin to clear it up, but next morning, he got all swollen and looked funny, so I had to bring him back in, and that's when the nurse say he must be allergic. Now he have to be given special antibiotics twice a day, like I got time to fuck around with medicine. And then they tried to blame me for the penicillin shit, like I should've known he'd have a bad reaction to it. Well, I ain't allergic to penicillin, so I know he didn't get that shit from me. Plus, if he was allergic to something for real he would have told me about it. He probably reacted crazy like that because they poked him up with all those needles, not 'cause of no antibiotic nobody asked them to squirt up in him in the first place. People think they can teach me shit about 'Drae I don't know. They think I sit around all day and don't lift a finger. They go on about how he needs to be toilet-trained before he goes to kindergarten, but they don't give a shit that I know his favorite food is Gummi Bears, and that he loves Sean John. He also has this wooden spoon he calls Ugga that he bites on all the time, which I know is a little fucked-up but I let him do it 'cause it's important to let kids be kids. I'm a good mom. I don't see anyone else watching that baby all damn day long and buying him Arby's. 'Cept for sometimes his older sister Rywanda watch him. She eight now and she needs some fucking responsibility if she's not going to go to school. I told her how the people from the school get on my ass when she don't go, but she can't stand second grade. I'm like, damn, I didn't start cutting class until fifth grade. I thought she'd at least get through elementary, but I can't make her do shit she don't want to do. She just like me. But if she ain't going to school no more, Rywanda's gotta stay home and watch 'Drae. That boy better get over this shit soon, because ain't no way I'm going back to that clinic again. It took my ass near three hours to get there 'cause I have to transfer buses twice. Shit always happen when I take the kids on the bus, like that one time 'Drae got lost at the station and ended up on Channel 7, and that bitch Debra practically lived at my house for a week. If she want me to go back to that bullshit clinic, she can start giving me money for cab fare. I don't see her taking no three goddamn buses to get to her job. It's not like I don't got enough other things to do beside drag my ass all the hell the way out there. Those clinic people are real assholes, making me get 'Drae shots for some rubella crap he ain't even got. Even with all that vaccination shit 'Drae keep getting sick anyway. If they had a vaccination against crazy-ass temper tantrums that come out of nowhere, then I'd be down with that. These doctors think they can be the boss of you, like they know everything, but I know they are always trying to take money for stuff that just clear up on its own. Like everybody say Rywanda had strep or some shit two months ago. But she's a strong-ass bitch like her mom, and she fought that shit off in three weeks. Never even saw a doctor. 'Drae strong, too. All that medicine and vaccination stuff just makes kids cry all the damn time. I ain't raising no weak-ass baby who's gotta live in a bubble. I saw a show about kids who are allergic to like sunlight or air or something, and their parents can't hug them or nothing because they'd, like, die. That ain't happening to 'Drae, 'cause I love my baby. Plus I'm not covering everything in my house with plastic bullshit. 'Drae'll turn like four or something soon, and he's got to learn to stay away from stuff that makes him allergic, especially if I get that night manager job at the BP. It's like, cats make my eyes all watery, so I stay the fuck away from them. I don't want to find out he got sick playing with a big-ass jar of penicillin 'cause he never learned it'll hurt him. But 'Drae smart. He'll figure it out eventually, just like he did the clothes dryer."
Anna Nicole Smith Finally Reaches Target Weight,3/26/07,2660,"NASSAU, BAHAMAS—Former stripper turned Playboy Playmate turned reality-TV star Anna Nicole Smith has overcome her longtime struggle with obesity, at last reaching her target weight of 125 pounds, sources said Monday. ""Anna's been through a lot,"" said Florida Circuit Court Judge Larry Seidlin, who became visibly emotional as he spoke to reporters. ""But I think it's fair to say that she hasn't been this happy in years."" Forensics reports reveal that Smith's miraculous weight loss began on Feb. 8, when she was discovered unconscious in her Hollywood, FL hotel room. She then proceeded to shed the baby weight she had gained during her recent pregnancy, even as her numerous legal woes and the controversy surrounding her 6-month-old daughter Dannielynn's paternity thrust Smith into the public eye more than ever before. ""The last several weeks have been particularly rough for Anna, but thankfully she's turned a corner,"" said attorney Richard Millstein, the legally appointed guardian for Dannielynn. ""At least some good has come out of this sad and sordid tale."" Several sources close to Smith confirmed that she did have some work done in the intervening weeks, losing a significant amount of weight after doctors removed several pounds of her internal organs for toxicity tests. Others credit the loss to aggressive calorie cutting. Broward County Chief Medical Examiner Joshua Perper said Smith ""slowly and steadily"" shed the excess pounds before closing in on her goal in the past week. ""Those last 20 pounds were the hardest,"" Perper said. ""But God bless her, she did it. Finally, after all that struggle, she's in a good place."" Some weight-loss experts, however, see Smith's achievement as less than inspirational, claiming that such drastic crash dieting can cause the body to lose dangerous amounts of water and muscle mass. ""She can't be healthy,"" Miami-based dietitian Pam Archer said. ""From what I understand, her current appearance is, frankly, frightening. Even though she's reached her target, her weight is continuing to drop at an alarming pace. Pretty soon she'll be nothing but skin and bones."" Despite such criticism, Krista Barth, attorney for Smith's common-law husband Howard K. Stern, defended Smith. ""While we don't claim to be entirely pleased with the outcome of the events of the past several weeks, if nothing else, she finally lost the weight, and nobody, not even an appeals court, can take that away from her,"" Barth said. ""Anna Nicole deserves full credit for finally getting what she always wanted."" Smith is currently celebrating her new slimmed-down status in the Bahamas, where she is expected to remain indefinitely."
Fat Guy Mistakenly Thought Of As Strong,3/16/07,700,"FORT LAUDERDALE, FL—Due to his sheer mass, Derek ""Moose"" Glass, 26, is considered by his friends and relatives to be ""stronger than an ox,"" when in actuality the 5-foot-7, 275-pound bartender is just fat. ""I bet that guy can lift that desk over his head,"" friend Hank Ebbert, 27, said of Glass, who at that moment was lying on his couch finishing his fifth bag of Combos while watching Spike TV's Pros Vs. Joes. ""Man, I bounced right off of Moose during a collision at home plate last summer. That guy is solid muscle after you get past all that [fat]."" Ebbert went on to say that Glass was deceptively intelligent, though, in fact, the morbidly obese Glass has a below-average IQ, and is just quiet."
Slight Breeze Shatters Ken Griffey Jr.'s Femur,3/15/07,770,"CINCINNATI—Although Ken Griffey Jr. had nearly recovered from a broken hand sustained while playing with his children in December, his rehabilitation came to a sudden halt yesterday when a gentle 2 mph breeze wafted across his leg, shattering his femur in three places. ""I knew it was broken right when that breeze hit me,"" said Griffey, who was walking from his sports therapist's office to his car in order to drive to his daughter's piano recital at the time of the injury. ""These things just happen. If I would have known a breeze like that was coming, I never would have left the house."" Reds manager Jerry Narron has stated that, upon Griffey's return to the Reds, he will be fitted with a personalized protective bubble to be worn for the remainder of the season."
Actress' Abortion Written Into TV Show,3/13/07,3533,"CULVER CITY, CA—Writers of a popular prime-time CBS sitcom spent the last three weeks making late-stage script adjustments to work its female lead's recent abortion into its storyline, sources close to the show revealed Monday. In the upcoming episode of Same Difference, taped late last week and scheduled to air in May, star Kirsten Sumner's character, Trish O'Connell, the sharp-tongued but beautiful wife of portly Chicago bread-truck driver Greg O'Connell, played by Carl Hubbard, will reveal to her husband she was pregnant and had an abortion without his knowledge. Trish's revelation comprises the secondary, or ""B,"" story of the episode, in which Greg eats a meatball sandwich against his wife's wishes. ""It would've been insulting to our viewers if we never addressed the fact that Kirsten is so obviously post-abortion,"" executive producer Aaron Karsch said. ""We did consider shooting around the abortion and using lighting tricks and strategically placed plants to cover up her uterus. But everyone would have been able to tell anyhow, so we figured we might as well use it to the show's advantage."" Sumner, who decided to terminate her pregnancy after several weeks of emotional deliberation, reportedly informed the show's executive producers about it earlier this month. Though the abortion posed a significant challenge for Same Difference's 12 writers, who were given the task of addressing it in a way that would not disrupt the show's lighthearted pace or contradict Sumner's on-screen persona, Karsch said such developments ""come with the territory."" ""When you're writing a successful sitcom, sometimes the actors' personal lives find a way to creep on set and you just have to adapt,"" Karsch said. ""Kirsten's around that age when a lot of actresses start thinking about having abortions, so I guess it's not that surprising."" After viewing the rough edits of the new scenes, Karsch said he ""couldn't be happier"" with the decision to include Sumner's abortion in the show, and expects the episode will be Same Difference's most popular since ""High Definition,"" a 2002 episode in which Greg bought a big-screen TV. ""It wasn't easy, but in the end, we got some very solid material out of it—the plotline stayed true to the O'Connells' relationship while still being entertaining,"" said co- executive producer Larry Krespie, adding that, thanks to the show's resourceful writing staff, Sumner's evacuated womb may be ""the best thing that ever happened to Same Difference."" Despite his initial skepticism about how the new abortion storyline would play to the female 36 to 49 demographic, Krespie was ultimately won over after viewing the rough edits. ""Kirsten did some brilliant acting,"" said Krespie, who called Sumner's portrayal of a woman who had recently had an abortion ""spot-on."" ""Our show does a lot of quiet, observational humor, and I think anyone who's had an abortion would be hard-pressed not to relate to, and get a chuckle out of, Trish's situation."" Continued Krespie: ""Kirsten really got into the mind of her character, even in the physical-comedy scenes, like when she was trying to avoid Greg and get out of the house to get the abortion. And later in the packed abortion clinic, when she mistakes the number 81 she received from the receptionist for 18, and finds out she has to wait much longer for her abortion. But it all leads to a nice, poignant ending when both characters realize they should have been honest with each other all along—Trish with her pregnancy, and Greg with his sandwich."""
Heavily Processed Food Makes Pathetic Nutritional Claims,3/12/07,867,"CHATTANOOGA, TN—In a move that industry observers are already calling desperate, McKee Foods today unveiled new packaging for Little Debbie Zebra Cakes that attempts to emphasize the snack's feeble nutritional value. ""When people think about getting five percent of their niacin intake, we want them to think of Zebra Cakes,"" said spokeswoman Celeste Freid, who showed an early prototype of the new design's bright bold claims that Zebra Cakes offer ""some vitamin C"" and contain ""almost one percent of your recommended thiamin mononitrate."" ""People will know just by looking at the box that every 200 Zebra Cakes fulfills their daily fiber requirements."" Though consumer Max Swindel, of Westport, MA, claimed the new approach is a ""waste of money,"" he did concede the snack's original claims of ""Delicious!"" ""Yummy!"" and ""Scrumptious!"" were dangerous understatements."
Specters Of Dental Hygienists Past Haunt Convention Center,3/09/07,3511,"SPOKANE, WA—More than one dozen attendees of a drapery and window coverings trade show at the local Comfort Inn and Convention Center last weekend reported seeing ghostly manifestations of dental hygienists from conventions long forgotten. ""Wispy, milky shapes streaking past the veggie platters on the buffet tables, a faint odor of mouthwash, the sound of saliva suction machines coming from seemingly empty rooms—very spooky stuff,"" said Rich Vitanza, a Chicago-based salesman for Hunter Douglas Window Fashions, on Monday. ""It was enough to chill you to the bone, or at least make you floss regularly."" Similar reports have been commonplace at the Spokane Comfort Inn, which began hosting an annual dental hygienists convention in the 1970s. The first instances of supernatural dental hygiene–related activity, including the unexplained disappearances of sugary sweets from reception desks and room service breakfasts, began in the early 1980s. ""Once a week, like clockwork, a guest comes to the concierge desk and says that when he awoke, a new toothbrush was sitting on the edge of the bathroom sink, covered in a fresh coat of toothpaste,"" said desk manager Greg Meacham, who claimed he received phantom dental sealants on two occasions. ""Last month, the words 'Have your teeth cleaned every six months by a licensed oral-health professional' were projected onto the screen in the main ballroom during a luncheon. Thing is, the projector wasn't even plugged in at the time."" Over the years, guests have seen flickering lights in the hotel's stairway exposing what appeared to be X-rays of bicuspids, and paper spit cups arranged in elaborate geometrical patterns in the elevators. A few even reported being awoken in the middle of the night by the icy-cold touch of a gloved hand on their gums. ""I was cleaning my face, just about to reach over for my towel, when I heard a voice complaining about the Waterpik being no substitute for brushing,"" said Charlotte, NC resident Linda Matthie, who was a guest at the Comfort Inn during the Christmas holiday. ""Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a woman in a pastel outfit, but when I turned to look at her, she was gone."" ""Yes, Evelyn's practically an old friend of ours now,"" said desk manager Meacham, referring to one of the most well-known ghosts. ""The legend goes that she died of an aneurysm while attending a convention here. She's known to roam the halls, her yearning for proper oral hygiene forever unsated."" Meacham said he advises all visitors to expect chillingly banal conversations about the weather and children's soccer games to echo through the halls, though he reassures guests that the eerie smooth jazz music that often terrifies visitors originates from the hotel's public-address system. Paranormal investigator Richard Schmidt said that the hardworking, serious-minded hygienists haunting the convention center are merely yearning for the camaraderie and educational opportunities they so treasured in their earthly lives. ""Dental hygiene meant everything to them,"" Schmidt said. ""Their spirits linger here to learn about advances in tooth-whitening technology for all eternity—and to remember good times."" Recent plastics trade show–attendee Jonathan Storff said that a stay at the Comfort Inn need not be a frightening experience. ""Oh, I don't pay much attention to all the fuss,"" Storff said. ""My stay here was pretty uneventful, anyway, but my toothache is gone, my breath tastes minty fresh, and my smile has never been brighter."""
I Don't Want Health Care If Just Anyone Can Have It,3/07/07,4023,"As a concerned citizen, I must voice my adamant disapproval of the ""universal health care"" proposals we've been hearing so much about. I don't have any gripes with expanding and improving health coverage, per se. It's the ""universal"" part that irks me. Providing health care for all would completely undermine the whole idea of health care. If every last one of the 40 million uninsured bozos in this country is going to get access to the vast, virtually unnavigable system of medical care we chosen few now enjoy, then I no longer even want it. When hospital administrators see me flash my Blue Cross card, it means something. It tells the world, ""Hey, look at me: I pay increasingly high monthly premiums, submit to annual exams, and claim any health-related expenditures over seven percent of my yearly income on my taxes, and you can't."" But when this bill passes, they'll be handing out insurance cards willy-nilly, and nobody will be able to tell the difference between someone who's had health coverage for 20 years and someone whose boss was compelled by law to provide it to all full-time employees. Then again, maybe they'll offer some sort of special Platinum Plus medical card. But I can't count on that. Health care is all about exclusivity, pure and simple. It's for a group of like-minded people bonded by the dream of only having to contribute a portion of their weekly wages to ensure unfettered access to a number of licensed health care professionals. If we change all that, health care will be about as elite as a public restroom, open to any yokel who waltzes into an emergency room and can legally establish California residency. Mark my words, this will completely destroy the allure of filling out all the necessary-but-time-consuming paperwork, choosing one primary care physician attached to one specific plan, and becoming eligible for prescription medications at a reduced rate. The only reason this is even being considered is because a majority of voters want it. Well, of course they do—they don't have it! But you don't see 33rd Degree Freemasons letting any old average citizen into their inner sanctum just because he's curious. And you won't catch me sharing my God-given right to affordable lifesaving medical procedures with every bum who's got a jones for another hepatitis vaccination. It's undignified. After all, how do I know I've made it in this world if I'm not able to enjoy something others can't? Lack of access to health care is the seventh leading cause of death in the country, and that says something. It doesn't get much more elite than being part of a club other people are literally dying to get into. So what incentive would there be if everyone were guaranteed equal health care, regardless of income, age, or employment status? Who would be left to proudly tell their grandchildren about the glory days of PPOs? That is a future I'd rather not imagine, thank you very much. So why the constant desire to guarantee basic yearly screenings and vital operations for all, thus creating some kind of ridiculous, unrealistic safety net? How will people fully appreciate the excellence of the American health care system without the constant threat of it being yanked away at any moment? If middle-class children are given government-subsidized medical coverage from the beginning, they won't have anything to look forward to when they get older. Though my offspring will never have to worry about desperately trying to scrape together the money for a hospital visit, it doesn't mean we should do away with the millions of other uninsured Americans who show them how privileged they are to have it in the first place. That's just a simple matter of respect. I urge all citizens of good sense to reject any universal health care plan that gets put forward. It's time to stand up for what's right, and protect our most respectable institutions.

Temperature Of Coffee Expected To Rise Nine Degrees By End Of 21st Century,2/23/07,1096,"WASHINGTON, DC—A report released by the Union of Concerned Dietitians stated that not only will the temperature of coffee increase by nearly nine degrees by the end of this century, but also that the rise is directly linked to human activity. ""At this point, there is no way to reverse the trend, but we can slow it down,"" said UCD President Marilyn Presber, who blamed the rising temperature on corporate coffee ""super-heaters"" such as Starbucks, McDonald's, and Dunkin' Donuts, and added that if the public made a conscious effort to heat water short of its boiling point and pour ""extremely chilled"" milk into the beverage, the overall temperature increase could be delayed nearly 150 years. ""If we don't make some sacrifices now, our children's children will be living in a world in which it will be virtually impossible to avoid having the inside of their mouths burned."" However, many Americans remain skeptical of the coffee-heating issue, such as Tampa, FL coffee drinker Henry Giesen, 67, who calls it ""a hoax perpetuated by the anti-caffeine lobby and the carbonated-beverage industry."""
Doctor Trying To Get Unemployed Friend A Doctor Job,2/16/07,3636,"ALBANY, NY—Albany Memorial Hospital cardiologist Dr. Richard Grafton appealed to the Board of Trustees during its monthly meeting Monday to give his unemployed friend, Doug Ferris, a newly available position in the hospital's internal medicine wing, calling  Ferris ""a good guy, deep down"" and a ""hard worker when he wants to be."" ""Doug's been through some tough times, but I know if the hospital took a chance on him, he'd do great,"" said Grafton, 35, shortly after emerging from the meeting. ""He's good with his hands and takes direction real well. If I told him to put a stent in a patient's clogged artery, he'd do it. No questions asked."" ""He'd be fine, I swear,"" Grafton repeated. Ferris, 34, who attended Syracuse University with Grafton in the early 1990s and graduated with a bachelor's degree in communications in 1999, was reportedly laid off two weeks ago from his job as a TelePrompTer operator at the local CBS affiliate, WRGB-TV 6. Grafton said that attempting to get Ferris ""doctor work"" was ""the least [he] could do"" for his longtime friend. According to Grafton, when he learned that Dr. Ron Clarke, a general practitioner with 25 years experience, would be vacating the position to chair the SUNY-Albany medical school, he immediately thought of the newly jobless Ferris. ""He'd be doing very basic medical procedures,"" Grafton said. ""Like asking patients if they smoke, and if they do, telling them to quit. Eighty percent of being a doctor is knowing where the lymph nodes are anyhow."" Although Ferris' experience is limited to first-aid and CPR training received when he worked as a lifeguard 18 years ago, he said he would gladly accept any job that gives him the ability to pay his bills. And, he added, the chance to reunite with an old friend was ""a definite plus."" ""It's gonna be great to work with Graffy again,"" said Ferris, who, if he gets the position, would earn just over $250,000, approximately $220,000 more than he made previously. ""It'll be just like the summer of '93 when we barbacked at Bullfrog's [Bar & Grill]."" While Ferris said he planned to skim through borrowed copies of Gray's Anatomy and the Physicians' Desk Reference if hired, he believes direct, hands-on experience with such doctor activities as prescribing drugs and performing Caesarean sections would ultimately be the best teaching tool. ""I've always been one of those learning-by-doing types,"" Ferris said. ""Graffy told me that if you can put together a sound system without a manual like I can, you can pick up bone-setting. And if I ever get confused, I'll just go get one of the nurses."" Despite concerns about Ferris' lack of qualifications, most notably from Senior Administrator Theresa Bove and Chief Resident Dr. Alfred Jacobs, Grafton insisted Albany Memorial had ""nothing to lose"" by hiring Ferris. He assured the board that he would take full responsibility in the ""highly unlikely event"" that something goes wrong, ""What's the worst that can happen?"" Grafton said. ""I'm not trying to get him a job doing complicated thoracic surgery—just normal, everyday doctor stuff. Doug's not here to ruffle any feathers. The man just wants a job."" ""Plus, Doug could be a real breath of fresh air around here,"" Grafton continued. ""We already have plenty of doctor types on staff, and frankly, it can get a little stuffy. He's really funny once you get his sense of humor."" Should the board deny his request to hire Ferris, Grafton said he will contact their mutual friend, US Airways pilot Capt. Joshua Weldon, who might be able to connect Ferris with a ""sweet gig"" operating commuter flights between New York and Washington, D.C."
Nation's Joggers Sick Of Finding Dead Bodies,2/12/07,3854,"CHICAGO—Citing the sobering statistic that over 10,000 of the 12,800 slayings in the United States in 2006 were reported by joggers, a national coalition of fitness enthusiasts called upon government officials Tuesday to impose measures that would reduce the likelihood of runners discovering lifeless bodies. ""We joggers have lives outside of finding violent-crime victims,"" said jogger Elizabeth Riccardi, who recently stumbled upon the remains of a double-pickax homicide  while jogging around the Bartlett Reservoir near Scottsdale. ""We're willing to cooperate with law enforcement, but we don't all have the time to be consoled with a blanket and a cup of coffee while some cop asks us the same tedious questions."" Riccardi said that some joggers have become so fed up with the dead-body encounters that they've been forced to run only on busy sidewalks, to the chagrin of pedestrians. ""I don't run through Lincoln Park after 6 p.m. anymore, I steer clear of that alleyway by the liquor store, and I definitely do not jog by the river at all,"" Chicago resident Chaz Montgomery said. ""But, without fail, every few months I make another gruesome, routine-disrupting discovery."" ""I just want a good cardiovascular workout,"" Montgomery added. ""I never asked for this, not during an intense incline push or even a slow cooldown."" Sacramento-based runner Keith Stafford said the problem has gotten so bad for him that after he happened upon his latest body, an unidentified newborn girl, he considered ""leaving it there under the park bench for someone else to find for a change."" ""Why must runners bear this burden?"" Stafford said. ""My brother's a baker, but he never opens his oven to find a severed head inside."" To help remedy the problem, the American Joggers Association has proposed creating special police jogging units in major metropolitan areas. The units, active chiefly during the early morning and late-evening hours, would patrol parks, beaches, docks, vacant lots, factory grounds, and other common dumping sites for grisly murders. AJA President Nancy Staudenmeyer said that the problem now affects more than just recreational joggers. ""[Kenyan marathoner] Evans Rutto would most likely have won last year's Boston Marathon had he not come across an execution-style murder during Mile 19, and been detained and questioned for over an hour,"" Staudenmeyer said. ""And because the victim's hysterical mother barged in on his interrogation, Evans wasn't even able to finish the race."" The AJA has created a support network for corpse-finding runners, establishing a toll-free hotline and holding a series of 5K ""fun runs,"" all held in sealed-off, freshly cleaned, well-lit gymnasiums. The AJA also produced a series of print and TV public service announcements depicting an exasperated jogger discovering the body of a mutilated prostitute and immediately text-messaging his congressman. ""The PSAs have been very effective for raising awareness,"" Staudenmeyer said. ""There were a lot of joggers out there who thought they were the only ones finding bodies. Once they learn they're not alone, we can all work together to find a solution to this major inconvenience."" Still, many have given up running altogether, saying that the prospect of finding a naked body cut up with surgical precision has sapped whatever enjoyment they used to derive from the activity. ""I wanted to find something to replace running, so I took up fishing, "" former St. Paul, MN jogger Derek Janowitz said. ""That is, until my canoe bumped into that floating [strangling] victim."" ""I finally just gave up and bought a Stairmaster,"" he added. Public officials have not yet addressed joggers' concerns. Some privately admit that having joggers find dead bodies is a more effective and vastly more cost-efficient crime fighting alternative than using local law enforcement."
"Wah, Wah, I Have Seasonal Affective Disorder",1/31/07,3717,"Hey, everybody, look at me, I'm a tiny little baby who lets winter cold and an hour or two of extra darkness keep me from functioning. Boo-hoo, I've got seasonal affective disorder. All I feel like doing is sitting in my apartment, eating, and going beddy-bye because my hypothalamus can't cope with the decreased amount of daylight. Boo-hoo, I have fewer melanopsin proteins than regular people. Poor me, every morning I have trouble getting out of bed because it's still dark outside when I leave for work. The gray clouds and the icy slush and the brutal cold and ever-present darkness remind me of my impending doom. They magnify all my latent fears and feelings of hopelessness. Whine! I never feel this way when Mr. Sun is shining with all his might. I wish I could slumber all winter like a bear and not even be aware of the gloomy old winter outside and wake up in April when the grass is growing and the trees are budding and the flowers are blooming. Or better yet, I wish I could live in a magical place where it's sunny and warm all year round. Then I could be happy and have fun. But, wah, I can't afford to move, so I'm forced to live in dumb old Des Moines, where the sun dies at 4:49 p.m. Blubber-blub-blub, I've lost my social and intellectual coping mechanisms necessary to maintain my mental well-being, all because of a neurological condition over which I have no control and was afflicted with by a cruel random accident of biology. Pity poor little me! Every day between January and March is a living nightmare because I'm more psychologically vulnerable to the seasonal tilting of the planetary axis than most people—wah, wah, wah! Well, at least I have my $300 dawn simulator. As mean Old Man Dark approaches, I stare at it for 30 whole minutes and hope that its bright artificial light will cheer me up. But boo-hoo-hoo, my serotonin levels still aren't increasing. Besides, a dawn simulator is no substitute for wonderful, glorious Mr. Sun. Where are you, Mr. Sun? I thought you were my friend! Boo-hoo, I'm just a self-pitying little baby with a clinically diagnosed disorder who just wants to cry all the time or stare into space. My family doesn't understand me. They don't know why I just can't pull myself together. They think I'm crazy when they catch me gazing numbly at the kitchen wall. Sob! I am unable to pick up my 3-year-old and hug her or feel any motherly joy because I lack the sufficient amount of rods and cones in my retinas. Wahhh! Will Mr. Sun ever come out again? What if he never does? Oh, no! See, because I have seasonal affective disorder, I think about stuff like this all the time. That, and suicide! Just because it was cloudy outside yesterday, I had a big old panic attack and had to go to the hospital. My husband had to pick me up from the emergency room, and boy was he mad. I think everybody hates me! I feel totally worthless, and that makes my seasonal affective disorder worse! Bawl! Well, March 21 can't come fast enough. That's the first day of spring! On that day, my energy levels will magically increase because Mr. Sun is positioned above the equator. Soon the days will be longer and the sunlight shinier, and I can finally raise the shades in my bedroom and have friends again and sing and dance and play. I have the date circled on my calendar with a big smiley face saying, ""Rise and shine, Sharon! It's spring! Mr. Sun is going to hug you today. You're allowed to laugh for the first time in three whole months!"" It'll be the bestest day ever. But it's still over a month away! And I can't do anything about it but curl up under the covers praying for relief to a cruel God who probably doesn't even exist. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Poor, poor me!"
Meth Addicts Demand Government Address Nation's Growing Spider Menace,1/30/07,4037,"WASHINGTON, DC—Following the tragic falling death of 32-year-old methamphetamine addict Phillip Diggs, who was reportedly attacked by spiders while scaling a large construction crane near Palo Alto, CA, thousands of outraged and confused meth addicts marched frenetically on Washington as part of a week of activities urging the federal government to address the nation's growing spider epidemic. ""Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon—these spiders are everywhere,"" said Rich Harlowe, event organizer and founder of Tweakers' Rights NowNowNowNowNowNowNowNowNow!, in testimony before a Senate committee Tuesday. ""The government must address this problem before the situation gets out of hand and these poisonous, acid-shooting spiders develop the powers of mind control or—God forbid—flight."" ""America cannot afford to ignore this any crisis any longer,"" Harlowe added. The rally drew addicts from every part of the country, many traveling on foot through the night, trading sex with truck drivers for rides, or stealing their brothers-in-law's bicycles. At dozens of rambling public speeches, organizers decried the fact that it took the spider-related death of an innocent meth addict to raise awareness of the issue, while lauding the bravery of meth addicts, and methamphetamines themselves. A 45,000-word proposal was drafted by members of TRN during a marathon, 72-hour meeting under the Roosevelt Bridge, and presented twice to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. The document, which includes schematics for the development of a giant ""spider bomb"" the size of Rhode Island, concludes repeatedly that the problem would best be combated with large quantities of methamphetamines and steel wool. ""This very morning, I saw a small child completely covered in hairy, bloodsucking, screaming tarantulas while his parents stood by and did nothing,"" said protester Joe Lopez, pausing to spit out a black and decayed tooth. ""I was appalled. I shouted horrible profanities and incantations at them, but they ignored me."" ""I, I, I don't—this is just, just, just—I, I, I—guh, ah,"" he added. TRN activists claimed that they called for federal assistance only as a last resort, after months of trying to contain the problem with diplomacy, force, cathode rays, and methamphetamines. ""These spiders are unstoppable,"" meth addict and self-described spider-hater Christine Mitchell said. ""We've tried everything from scrubbing ourselves raw with bleach, to burning them off with lit cigarettes, to scrubbing ourselves raw with bleach. We've even tried burning them off with lit cigarettes. We're out of options."" Mitchell urged senators to form an anti-spider task force, but cautioned that the creatures' ability to appear and disappear at will would rule out a bleach-related ""quick fix"" solution to the infestation. Several other unnamed addicts who wandered in and out of the hearings described their efforts to establish ""an open dialogue"" with the spiders, but said the arachnids responded by growing dramatically in size and speaking with the voices of John Goodman, Gene Hackman, and Rosie Perez, bringing the first round of negotiations to an abrupt end. ""We tried talking to them, we tried screaming at them, we tried bursting into uncontrollable crying fits in front of them, but nothing seemed to work,"" said one witness, who refused to divulge his name, age, or ""who sent [him] here."" ""Even with human heads, they would not listen to reason."" Though most committee members had left the hearings before Harlowe's closing remarks at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, some indicated a willingness to investigate the addicts' claims more closely. ""I believe it is our duty and responsibility to act before we lose even more Americans of voting age,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D–CA), who noted that her home state had more meth addicts than any other in the country. ""Pollsters tell us that one in five voters is, has been, or will be a meth addict at some point in their lifetimes. That's a voting bloc too big for us to ignore."""
"Ailing Castro Begins 750,000 Last Words",1/30/07,902,"HAVANA—With his condition reportedly deteriorating, Cuban President Fidel Castro called top members of Cuba's National Assembly to his side and embarked on what is believed to be his 750,000 final words, according to Radio Havana Cuba, which broadcast the first 36,000 words of his apparent farewell starting Monday. ""I am not long for this world, comrades, so come close, and listen well,"" began Castro, who was expected to scale back overnight with a mere 12,000 words from his deathbed, before fully resuming with a declaration of grievances and a discussion of Italian cinema in the morning. ""…Until oppression and fear are rooted from this world, our lives may end, but our work will only begin. More water please."" Cuban government officials are reportedly working out a deal to publish the 80-year-old dictator's historic last remarks as the next three volumes of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations."
Too Much Expected From Nap,1/25/07,702,"NASHVILLE, TN—Vanderbilt University sophomore Derek Sellars drastically overestimated the mental clarity, physical replenishment, and restorative power he would attain from a 7 p.m. nap Tuesday. ""I thought I'd feel fresh and good to go for the rest of the night,"" said Sellars, who added that the brief sleep completely failed to give him the wherewithal to complete his calculus assignment or inspire a ""great topic"" for his 19th-century English Literature class paper due Wednesday morning. ""I couldn't really tell what day it was and I was all sweaty. In fact, I felt more tired somehow."" Despite the setback, Sellars plans to work straight through until his next 30-minute nap, scheduled for 3 a.m."

Hero Man Dials 911,12/11/06,2990,"NORCROSS, GA—Patricia Welch is lucky to be alive. Just days ago, the 37-year-old human-resources specialist lay helpless and bleeding on the brink of death, the victim of a freak accident in her own home. But the story gets even stranger: Welch owes her life to one brave but unlikely companion, who remarkably managed to dial 911 just in time. According to Welch, Tony, her 36-year-old husband and ""best friend,"" jumped to action after a loud crash Sunday woke him from a mid-afternoon nap on his favorite spot on the couch. Running through the house, he eventually came upon Welch, who was pinned beneath a collapsed wooden shelf used to store canned foods and nearly unconscious. He immediately sensed that she was in trouble and, amazingly, headed directly for the upstairs kitchen phone. ""He must have somehow knocked the phone off its cradle,"" said Welch, ruffling Tony's hair as the two sat in their living room. ""I guess he just did it out of instinct."" Tony's actions astonished even seasoned emergency personnel at the 911 call center. ""At first, I thought it was some kind of practical joke,"" said dispatcher Wanda Emerson, who fielded the call. ""All I could hear was some panting and the occasional whimper. But then it occurred to me that he was actually trying to communicate with us."" Emerson said that Tony remained on the line long enough for her to trace the address and dispatch emergency medical technicians. She also believes he somehow understood her instructions to return to the basement and wait patiently by Welch's side until help could arrive. ""His loyalty was, literally, a lifesaver,"" Emerson said. When EMTs arrived on the scene minutes after his call, Tony emerged, barking orders and other vital information to the stunned medical personnel, including six-year veteran Noah Archibald. ""He looked extremely excited, and we could hardly keep up with him as he led us downstairs to [Mrs. Welch],"" Archibald said. ""He had even fetched her a little blanket. It was as if he could tell how serious the situation was, and really wanted her to live."" Emory University behavioral psychologist Janice Applebaum said that, while rare, similar situations have occurred in the past. ""Men will occasionally perform beyond what we would expect in times of crisis due to a primal urge to protect their loved ones,"" Applebaum said. ""Often it's a simple matter of adrenaline temporarily taking over."" ""But I woudn't be surprised if Tony was back on the sofa in no time, as if nothing had ever happened,"" she added. Welch said that she had never seen Tony dial 911 before, and speculated that he must have been imitating behavior he had seen elsewhere—perhaps even on television. Whatever the explanation, Patricia Welch is thankful for the noble act. ""Finding Tony has greatly enhanced my life, but I never thought he'd end up saving it someday,"" Welch said. ""I'll tell you another thing: As soon as I get home, somebody very special is getting a nice, juicy piece of steak."""

""I'm doing fine, but now just feels like the right time to get major reconstruction done on my ankle,"" Hill said after a practice in which he led his team in several sets of wind sprints, and showed off his newly restored jumping ability with a 180-degree dunk. ""My only hope is that the Orlando fans understand that this is ultimately for the best, and after rehab, I should be back next year ready to go."" Hill has scheduled his surgery to take place the day before the Magic face the Detroit Pistons, a game Hill has been anticipating all season now that he is capable of playing full time and is leading his team in scoring."
Eagles Fans Fully Expect Donovan McNabb To Play With Torn ACL,11/23/06,1034,"PHILADELPHIA—Although All-Pro quarterback Donovan McNabb was sidelined last week with a torn anterior cruciate ligament that doctors expect will keep him from playing for eight to 12 months, the majority of Eagles fans fully expect McNabb to suit up for Philadelphia's game this Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts. ""This is an important game for the Eagles and for the city of Philadelphia, and a chance for Donovan to finally prove himself and get the Eagles back on the path to the Super Bowl,"" said 42-year-old Philadelphia resident Harold Guthrey, who dismissed reports that the swelling in torn and ruptured tissues around McNabb's knee was so severe that surgery would have to wait at least four weeks. ""The people of this great city have put their trust in Donovan McNabb, and he should know that Philadelphia fans expect their Eagles to play tough."" According to Dr. Frank Fitzgerald, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in catastrophic knee injuries and lifelong Eagles fan, McNabb should seek him out for a second opinion."
End-Life Crisis Marked By Extravagant Spending Spree,11/20/06,4057,"TOLEDO, OH—Ever since his retirement nearly a decade ago, area resident Oscar Subitzky just hasn't been the same. What began as a single, uncharacteristic extravagance—the payment of $15,000 for a coronary angioplasty to expand his narrowing arterial wall—has given way to a growing number of personal luxuries, from the latest brand-name heart medications to the most advanced palliative care. The unusual developments have led concerned family members to suspect that the once prudent and conservative 74-year-old widower is undergoing an acute end-life crisis. ""Sure, the operation seemed a little indulgent at first, but we could tell it was really important to Dad, so we didn't try to stop him from having it,"" said daughter Martha Welsch, 46, who can still remember when her father didn't need ""pricey doodads"" like defibrillators and cardiopulmonary-resuscitation devices to be content. ""We all thought this was going to be a one-time thing, that it was just something Dad had to get out of his system, and then things would go back to normal,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, one surgery quickly became two surgeries, which soon turned into three surgeries,"" Welsch added. ""That's when we realized the whole thing was a lot more serious than Dad just wanting to get a clogged artery cleared."" Subitzky's end-life crisis began when he suddenly left a secure job as an accountant at the age of 65. Welsch admitted she didn't quite understand what had come over Subitzky until he announced six months after his retirement that he had started seeing a cardiologist nearly half his age. ""You hear those stories about men in their late 60s all of a sudden coming home with an expensive new pacemaker or deciding to get work done on their kidneys out of the blue, but Dad just never seemed like the type,"" Welsch said. ""If he honestly thinks that spending thousands of dollars on blood transfusions is going to change the way he feels inside, I'm afraid he's got another think coming."" Lately, Welsch said, between ""all those fancy new breathing tubes he now wears,"" and the company of a new live-in nurse only a few years older than some of his grandchildren, she sometimes doesn't recognize her father. ""What's he going to do next, gallivant off to some $10,000-a-day, all-inclusive hospice?"" she wondered. In addition to throwing money around ""like there's no tomorrow,"" as Welsch puts it, Subitzky has also reportedly grown obsessed with his appearance, examining his body for lumps, bruises, or signs of congested veins dozens of times a day. According to son Patrick Subitzky, 39, who admits to being a little embarrassed by his father's newfound vanity, the older man's obsession with his looks has also resulted in a ""ridiculous new diet"" of only dark-green leafy vegetables, fruits high in citric acid, whole-grain cereals, and absolutely no meat or dairy products. ""I love him and everything, but I don't know who my father thinks he is anymore,"" said Subitzky, who cringes every time his elderly father speeds around town in that ""loud and flashy"" ambulance. ""He's even talking about a trip to Denver to see some heart specialist there. Whatever happened to the Oscar Subitzky who hated to travel?"" According to psychologist Elizabeth Schulz, who specializes in mortality-identity issues, an end-life crisis is an emotional state of fear and anxiety that often affects men and women between the ages of 65 and 100, and is usually sparked by the uncomfortable realization that one's time on earth is limited. ""Individuals in the middle of an end-life crisis are usually easy to spot, as they tend to foolishly acquire big-ticket items such as liver transplants to compensate for feelings of growing inadequacy,"" said Schulz, who in the past several years has observed increasing numbers of clients suffering from the common disorder wheeling themselves into her office. ""While these shortsighted material purchases will often work at first, leaving the individual feeling rejuvenated and even energized, in the long term they have very little effect."""
Report: More U.S. Soldiers Suffering From Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder,11/15/06,3762,"NORFOLK, VA—Pre-traumatic stress disorder, a future-combat-related psychological condition previously thought to afflict only young soldiers drafted against their will, is now found in growing numbers among National Guard members, Army, Navy, Marine, and Air Force reservists, semi-retired officers, and the newly recruited, according to a government study released Monday. ""When soldiers are put in the extreme situation of facing the possibility of large-scale death and shocking violence, many experience sleeplessness and outbursts of anger,"" said Walter Reed Army Hospital psychologist Capt. Sidney Mullenthauer. ""We're seeing more victims experience vivid, ultra-realistic flash-forwards of roadside bombings that tear through a group of innocent children, or rocket attacks on their convoys that leave fellow soldiers charred and smoldering."" ""Many of these poor souls are forced to prelive, over and over again, a landmine blowing their legs off, or large pieces of shrapnel becoming lodged in the sides of fellow soldiers' faces,"" he added. Army Pfc. Henry Gerard, 19, who suffers from acute Pre-TSD, said he blames the federal government for putting him in this mentally debilitating state. ""The government knows exactly what they intend to put me through, and they still haven't done a damn thing about it, man,"" said Gerard, who, nearly three weeks before reporting to Fallujah, suffers from nightmares in which his potential best friend is beheaded. ""I can't sleep, I can't eat, my hands constantly shake. I'm going to a place where people I don't even know will try to kill me. What the fuck?"" ""I'm not the same man I once was,"" Gerard said, adding that he spends every night drinking to drown out the screams and cries for help he expects to hear. ""War is going to be hell."" The study, conducted by the Department Of Future Veterans Affairs, found that 80 percent of part-time soldiers reported no signs of Pre-TSD while carrying out their obligatory one weekend of duty a month, but quickly developed severe symptoms upon receiving orders for active combat. ""This is also the first time we have observed both pre- and post-traumatic stress disorders occurring simultaneously,"" said Mullenthauer, who explained that the phenomenon is found most often among reservists who have returned home after completing their tour of duty and before being called up for an extra assignment. Researchers said the disorder can be brought on by the thought of holding a lifeless body in one's hands, the unshakable sense of dread accompanying an imagined nighttime ambush, and the stress of realizing one will spend 18 to 24 months in a foreign land thousands of miles from home in which death or severe injury seem all but inevitable. In addition, a significant number of those who will enter a war zone say they are plagued by repeated visions of atrocities, torture, and the CNN logo. One reservist, who has chosen to take the disease head-on by reporting to Iraq on his scheduled date, is Pvt. Franklin Mitchell, 31, husband and father of two. According to Mitchell's wife, Marian Mitchell, her husband's Pre-TSD was brought on by the proto-memories of being taken hostage. ""At first, of course, he was excited to get some money for college to study computer programming,"" Mitchell said. ""But when he came home after learning he was going to Iraq, he broke into a cold sweat and grew extremely depressed remembering how he will eventually have to shoot and kill another human being at close range."" Researchers have recently identified new segments of the population also considered to be at risk for Pre-TSD, including parents of children approaching military age, Iraqi citizens, and any person who watches more than three hours of television news per day."
Over-Competitive Lance Armstrong Challenges Cancer To Rematch,11/09/06,4744,"AUSTIN, TX—Lance Armstrong, the ultra-competitive seven-time Tour de France champion who recently ran the New York Marathon in under three hours, held a press conference Tuesday to announce that he will be taking the next three months to prepare for a rematch against the opponent with whom he is most often identified: cancer. ""I owe it to myself, to my fans, and to cancer's opponents around the world to prove that I can beat this deadly disease once again,"" said Armstrong, who says he has nothing to fear from once again facing the nemesis that defined him as an athlete. ""We took each other to the edge the last time we met in 1996, and you almost ended my career. Even if you have what it takes to face me again, I'm willing to bet everything you still don't have what it takes to bring me down."" Armstrong added that, with all the free time he has had as of late, he has been seeking out cancer everywhere, including the American Cancer Society, the Mayo Clinic, the oncology ward at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and most recently, on the streets of New York City. ""I can't deny that cancer got a piece of me last time,"" Armstrong said. ""A big piece of me. I think about it every day. But once I got done with cancer, it was nowhere to be found. It disappeared. Well, cancer, you know where to find me. I can beat you again in six—no, in three months."" ""I want cancer,"" Armstrong added. ""I want cancer so bad I can almost taste it."" Cancer, the much-feared disease that has defeated legendary athletes such as Floyd Patterson, Lyle Alzado, and Walter Payton, is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, and is 0-1 when battling Lance Armstrong. However, Armstrong said he would like to beat cancer more convincingly, saying that the first time he faced off against cancer's flurry of histological attacks, the disease dealt him a ""cheap blow below the belt."" ""You have to hand it to cancer,"" Armstrong said. ""It snuck up on me and certainly changed my life forever. But this time, through intense physical and mental preparation, I am going to show it what Lance Armstrong is all about."" ""It will take dedication, no doubt about it,"" Armstrong added, noting that he is also committed to sleeping 17 hours a day. ""But I live for competition. And everyone who knows me knows that the physical and emotional ordeals I endure are what I thrive on."" The world-class athlete claims he is open to any sort of challenge the disease can offer him, although he hopes this time cancer comes at him in a way that will ""really push [him] to the brink."" ""I wouldn't mind something like brain or lung [cancer], but I think cancer is going to surprise me with something different like a case of acute lymphocytic leukemia or even something in my pancreas,"" Armstrong said. ""It never hits the same way twice. Either way, I give myself a 100 percent chance of survival."" ""I got cancer once,"" Armstrong added, gesturing defiantly towards the cameras. ""I bet I can get it twice as good this time."" Armstrong has already come under criticism from sportswriters and epidemiologists who say that Armstrong is attempting to relive his glory days. ""Lance is a proud man, and no one doubts him for a second, but this cancer thing is just eating away at his insides,"" said University of Texas epidemiologist Graham Heatherington, who trained Armstrong for his first bout with cancer in 1996. ""I think by taking on cancer again, he's trying to tell the world he's not ready to lie down and die just yet."" ""What, do you think he's afraid to do what he has to do?"" said Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly, a longtime Armstrong supporter. ""Go on a strict daily regimen of diet and exercise? Shave his head? Get chemotherapy till he throws up and can no longer stand? He's done it once, and we love him for it. You know what? I for one hope he gets cancer again. I hope he gets it good this time."" ""It'll be good for the sport,"" Reilly added. Although Armstrong's friends and family, especially his mother Linda Armstrong Kelly, wish he would reconsider his decision to battle cancer again, they nonetheless say that they will be there to support him and stick by his bedside until the bitter end. ""Frankly, I don't think he has anything to prove,"" Kelly said. ""I should have known years ago that he would eventually try to get cancer again."" ""Hopefully, he beats it,"" she added. Armstrong, who has not ruled out injecting himself with known carcinogens if the disease fails to accept his challenge within the next two weeks, denied that he was doing it for publicity. ""My only hope,"" Armstrong said before concluding the press conference, ""is that by once again beating cancer, I can help raise awareness for cancer."""
Frito-Lay Angrily Introduces Line Of Healthy Snacks,11/07/06,4148,"PLANO, TX—With the recent trend of wholesome snack foods reaching ""truly ridiculous proportions,"" Frito-Lay announced Monday that it would, against its better judgment, roll out a new line of healthy fruit-and-vegetable-based chips next February. ""Here,"" said Frito-Lay CEO Al Carey as he disgustedly tossed a bag of the company's new Flat Earth-brand snack crisps onto the lectern during a meeting with shareholders and members of the press. ""Here's some shit that's made from beets. I hope you're all happy now that you have your precious beet chips with the recommended daily serving of fruit, or vegetables, or whatever the hell a 'beet' is."" ""Mmm, dehydrated bulb things,"" Carey added. ""Sounds delicious."" Carey appeared visibly appalled as Frito-Lay employees distributed Flat Earth snack samples to the audience. ""God help us all, would you look at these flavors,"" said Carey, gesturing toward a display showcasing the several varieties of Flat Earth chips, including Kauliflower Krunch, Raisins 'N Chives, Cranberry Spinach Explosion, Rutabaga Yum, Tofu Snaps, Eggplant Ecstasy, Broccoloroos, and Watercress. ""Look at what you've reduced us to."" ""Weren't Sun Chips healthy enough for you, you goddamn hippie bastards?"" Carey added. Frito-Lay spokeswoman Lisa Greeley, who said that the company made a commitment in 2004 to develop a healthier line of snacks but ""never thought it would actually come to this,"" described the Flat Earth brand as ""tailor-made for the small, vocal minority of health-conscious consumers who apparently can't just be content with salads, bananas, apples, or any of the literally thousands of fruits and vegetables already widely available."" ""Our new veggie snacks combine the zesty tang of parsnip, the most mouthwatering root vegetable out there, with the bold flavor of, let's say, jute?"" said Greeley before reluctantly bringing a Turnips 'N Radish chip to her mouth and forcing down a full bite. ""It's a brand-new taste sensation unlike anything you've ever experienced, unless you've ever eaten sisal twine."" According to Frito-Lay's website, the new snacks contain one-third of the fat, one-half of the calories, and one-1,000th of the irresistible flavor of Frito-Lay's classic line of potato and corn chips. The presence of trans-fats and saturated oils is avoided by employing a cooking process ""strikingly similar to the method used to create particle board."" Serving suggestions that will be printed on the packaging include ""definitely not adding any salt or seasoning, because then you might die""; dipping the chips in ""delicious plain yogurt, lettuce paste, or other ground-up Flat Earth products""; and enhancing the flavor by replacing the chip in your hand with a Hot'n Spicy BBQ chip. In January, Frito-Lay will launch a Flat Earth marketing campaign based on the slogan, ""Bet You Can't Eat Even One."" Surprisingly, however, the company is also in talks with distributors to ensure that Flat Earth snacks are installed in every school vending machine in the country. ""Oh, they're definitely going in the vending machines,"" Carey said. ""Everyone's going to share in this misery, not just a handful of Naderites with spastic colons or loser kids with no taste buds whose parents want them to grow up to be boring milquetoasts afraid to have any fun. And don't think we haven't forgotten you either, office workers on snack breaks and anyone who wants to serve a big bowl of disappointment at a cocktail party."" ""If this is what you want, America, fine,"" Carey continued. ""But if you don't like them, then you can suck my fucking dick, because this is it—no more veggie crisps after this. None. You hear me? None."" ""You're all gonna die eventually, anyway,"" Carey added. ""Might as well be eating Cool Ranch Doritos with cheese dip when you go."" Frito-Lay is now considering discontinuing its traditional snack line and focusing entirely on chickpeas and sprouts, since, according to Carey, Americans ""are so scared of getting fat, and are clearly no longer interested in good-tasting food."" ""You all disgust me,"" said Carey, who then kicked over the Flat Earth display and stormed out of the room."
America's Cowboys Suffering From Restless Heart Syndrome,11/03/06,3587,"ATLANTA, GA—Officials from the Centers For Disease Control said Monday that preliminary results from a long-term study showed that the vast majority of America's cowboys suffer from Restless Heart Syndrome, a disorder categorized by deep pangs of yearning, usually following extended, alternating bouts of lethargy and wanderlust. ""It's likely that most victims don't even know they have it,"" said research coordinator Grant Richardson, who estimates that 90 percent of cowboys are carriers of the malady. ""Then one day they're staring into a glass of whiskey while the bartender sweeps the cigarette butts off the floor, and they get to wondering about what there is to find in the next town West of wherever they happen to be. After that, something changes inside them."" Researchers isolated a hormone in nearly all of the 500 cowboys studied that triggers a subconscious longing for the feel of a saddle and the sight of windswept plains as far as a body can see. ""Next thing they know, they're tipping their hat down low, pulling up their boots, and heading off in the direction of them twinklin' stars,"" Richardson said. RHS seems to strike most often in younger ranch hands who have been restricted to the same patch of land for six months or more without being able to take long rides in God's country, where the coyotes prowl the sagebrush. Some cowboys also experience severe symptoms after taking just one whiff of old paint. Nor does the disorder appear to be a new phenomenon. After studying hundreds of tattered letters and mournful ballads, researchers determined that RHS has been afflicting cowboys since the mid-1800s, when the West was still wild and a tumbleweed could still be blown across the plains from St. Louis to Frisco without hittin' a fence. A significant number of cases appear to be triggered by an undersupply of love from a good woman. If detected early, however, RHS can be treated. ""If any cowboys find themselves experiencing unfamiliar emotions for which there just ain't no words, or an impulse to gaze up and wonder if she's watching the same sun set over Texas—home to more than 95 percent of cowboys' exes—I would urge them to swallow their pride, and come on in to see doc immediately."" Cowboy Sam Parker said he has been suffering the effects of RHS for ""purt' near as long as [he] can recollect."" ""Once I've been off the trail for a piece, my heart gets a wanderin' to thoughts of my darlin', sweet Annabelle—who couldn't marry me on account of her pa not approvin',"" Parker said, subconsciously clutching his 10-gallon hat. ""A man can only stand so much before he gets a hankerin' to set off with no one but his thoughts, his horse and 300 head of cattle. I don't care one bit if it means eatin' bacon and beans every day and every night."" Many pediatricians who believe RHS manifests in early childhood have been counseling mothers to consider whether or not they should allow their babies to grow up to be cowboys, who will never stay home and are always alone, sadly, even with someone they love. Leading epidemiologists say their goal is to contain the disease, which has no known cure, before it progresses to a more serious form such as Aching Heart Syndrome, Burning Heart Syndrome, or Trail's End Disease. ""The worst part is that many of these taciturn, weather-beaten men don't want to be healed—you can't throw a cowboy's heart in the hoosegow,"" said cowboy counselor and RHS sufferer Sam Langley. ""And the problem is, they ain't wrong. They're just different. And their hearts won't let 'em do things to make you think it's right."""
Area Smoker One Of America's Top Phlegm-Producers,11/02/06,850,"WASHINGTON, DC—A report released by the Department Of Respiratory Affairs revealed that Brooklyn, NY smoker T. Eric Mayhew, 38, has risen to the ranks of America's 2006 top phlegm-producers, alone accounting for nearly  seven percent of aggregate phlegm yield in the Northeast. ""I've made great strides these past two years, and with—"" said Mayhew, pausing to hack up approximately 10 fluid ounces of brown and orange sludge, ""—the onset of winter, I have every confidence that I can far exceed my quota in the next quarter."" Mayhew, whose sustained coughing fits can reportedly last more than 90 seconds, joins such steadfast phlegm-makers as coal miner Frank Wallersheim, five-glass-a-day milk drinker Bob Muncie, and gravel-voiced actor Wilford Brimley. The former top phlegm-producer, Saginaw, MI's Margaret Gunter, dropped abruptly off the list."

Frank Thomas Credits Recent Power Surge To Steroids,9/28/06,963,"OAKLAND, CA—After two seasons marked by nagging injuries and sub-par home-run totals, Frank Thomas credited his career rejuvenation and rediscovered power stroke ""strictly to my weekly cycle of injecting myself with anabolic steroids."" ""People ask me all the time what's my secret, how have I stayed in such good shape and been so consistent this season, and I tell them the same thing every time: It's the steroids,"" said Thomas, who has 19 homers and a league-high 62 RBI since the All-Star break. ""I give the steroids all the credit. It's not even just the muscle and the power, but the confidence I have when I step up to the plate knowing I have a total competitive advantage. I just wish I knew about this miracle drug earlier in my career."" MLB officials later announced that, should Thomas test positive for steroid use in a random drug test before season's end, his punishment would be significantly reduced for being open and honest about it beforehand."
Pectoral Muscles Targeted By Fitness Fundamentalists,9/21/06,879,"SANA'A, YEMEN—A videotaped statement shown Monday on Yemeni television provides the most conclusive evidence yet that the Muslim bodybuilding extremist group al-Huuruugh has acquired dumbbells from an unknown source and could use them to target vulnerable, undeveloped muscle groups in their pectoral region. ""I call upon the world to stand witness as I violently and repeatedly blast these pecs, purifying and rebuilding them into a shape pleasing to Allah!"" a masked, shirtless weightlifter said in the tape, over the strains of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing."" ""Seven! Eight! Nine! God is great, and so are my pecs, trapezius muscles, lower back, and abs! Thirteen! Fourteen! The great Satan Of Flab will soon feel the burn!"" State Department officials said the group is almost certainly a danger to themselves if they do not use better form and stretch thoroughly afterward."

Hero Firefighter Loses Lifelong Battle With Fire,9/12/06,2788,"DES MOINES, IOWA—After years spent in and out of hospitals, warehouses, and office buildings consumed by fire, Lieutenant Anthony Castillo, 46, finally succumbed to the combustion he had so bravely battled during most of his adult life, sources close to the deceased hero said Monday. Castillo, who over the years had become a symbol of courage to countless individuals faced with their own deadly blazes, passed away early Sunday morning at a suburban home, surrounded by family members, neighbors, fellow firefighters, and raging, crackling flames. ""Anthony fought every day with honor and dignity, beating fire after fire, against all hope, back into remission,"" said wife Barbara Castillo, who told reporters she will always remember Anthony as the loving father of their three children, and not the ""burned-out shell of a man"" he became during the last moments of his life. From the onset of those first frightening symptoms, which included 3,000-degree temperatures, prolonged coughing spasms, and night sweats that soaked through his heavy polysynthetic firefighter’s coat, to his last dying breath of toxic hydrocarbons, ""never once did my husband complain,"" said Castillo's widow. ""Even at the end, Anthony was a bright, shining light of strength, a true hero who burned with an intensity and determination we will never forget,"" she added. ""I can’t believe he’s gone."" The fire that ultimately took Castillo’s life—the result of a rare form of electrical shortage—is now believed to have started in a three-story Cape Cod–style home’s basement, before spreading quickly to the kitchen, living room, and principal hallways. By the time the full-blown inferno had been detected, there was little anyone could do. ""Dad had gone through some serious scares, but he always managed to pull through,"" said eldest son Brian Castillo, who remembers his father being rushed from their home in countless emergencies growing up. ""We all knew that a serious blaze could flare up at any moment, but he had been doing so well these last few months. It’s still a shock."" Castillo’s death also shocked his fellow firefighters, many of whom had seen him animated and full of life just moments before. According to Engine Company 2 Commander Robert Penderbelt, Castillo spent the last months of his life educating people as best he could about fire prevention. ""While there were times when Anthony was obviously in a great deal of pain, I never once saw it stop him from trying to help others,"" Penderbelt said. ""When Anthony lost his hair to a series of grueling chemical fires last year, we feared the worst, but he was back at it the next week like nothing had happened."" Castillo’s remains were scattered in an unplanned public ceremony late Sunday afternoon, moments after the wind picked up."

Make-A-Wish Recipient Now Wishes Macho Man Randy Savage Would Go Away,9/01/06,3966,"PHOENIX—9-year-old leukemia patient Tyler Blashock was initially ecstatic to learn Monday that the Make-A-Wish Foundation was sending Macho Man Randy Savage to meet him at the Phoenix Children’s Hospital. But after spending half a day with Savage, Blashock said he wished the 44-year-old wrestler would ""just go."" Tyler, who was diagnosed six months ago with acute lymphocytic leukemia and has undergone chemotherapy through painful cerebrospinal injection, said the two-time WWF World Heavyweight Champion was physically and mentally demanding. ""I really only wanted him to give me an autograph and tell me what it was like to fight the Ultimate Warrior,"" Tyler said. ""Not read me bedtime stories and try to feed me."" ""Crying hurts,"" Tyler added. Tyler’s father Frank said he and wife Helen were ""thrilled"" that their son would finally have a positive experience, ""especially after his hair started falling out."" ""But in Tyler’s weakened state, it’s all been too much,"" Frank said. ""Far too intense."" According to Helen Blashock, Macho Man, who arrived wearing dark sunglasses and matching leather hat and vest, burst into Tyler’s hospital room and shouted, ""Hey there little dude, I’m here to make you feel gooooood!"" ""You could just see the confusion in Tyler’s eyes—he didn’t understand why this was happening to him,"" Mrs. Blashock said. ""He’s been so brave."" Savage, who told Tyler his sickness reminded him of the time he wrestled Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat and ""crushed that pip-squeak’s larynx,"" said that he enjoys helping less-fortunate fans. ""I do what I can to pump the kids up,"" Savage said. ""I’m still on their team even though they can’t tag me in for this fight."" Savage also brought old Wrestlemania videos to watch with Tyler. ""My eyes and my bones and everything aches,"" Tyler said. ""I just want to sleep."" Earlier in the afternoon, Savage lifted the boy’s arm in the air to show that he had won a mock wrestling match, then ran circles around the room, slapping his own face. ""Tyler’s bone marrow is so damaged that there is almost no blood clotting, so the slightest touch will leave substantial bruising,"" said Tyler’s doctor, pediatric oncologist Suri Prendesh. ""It’s also best that Tyler avoid any more playful Savage Elbows or Scoop Slams."" Though Tyler had been showing signs of improvement, doctors feared Macho Man’s ""unending"" boasts and product plugs were trying the boy’s already-weak immune system. ""Tyler’s still worn out from his biopsy, and this man will jump right in his face and scream, ‘Snap into remission!’"" Helen said. ""When will my son have some peace?"" ""I don’t like when he sings his songs,"" Tyler said, referring to Savage’s impromptu performance of songs from his rap album Be A Man. ""They make me sad."" The Blashocks said they were initially relieved when Savage sprinted out of the room at 10 p.m., but his absence was short- lived. ""We thought it was the end of the ordeal,"" Mr. Blashock said. ""But sure enough, 15 minutes later, we hear, ‘All right, Tyler, let’s clothesline this cancer,’ and we knew tomorrow was going to be another day that our son wouldn’t be able to swallow any food."" Savage also used the occasion to issue a challenge to rival Hulk Hogan. ""Dig it, Hulkster: If you’re not afraid, we’ll throw down right here for the kid,"" said Savage, who has never defeated Hogan in a professional match. ""Then he’ll see once and for all that the Macho Man truly is the greatest wrestler that has ever lived."" ""Oooooh yeaaaaaahhhhhh,"" Savage added. The overwhelming sensory assault has left the Blashock family wondering how they will ever be able to ""beat this thing."" ""When Dr. Prendesh politely informed Macho Man that the high fat content in Slim Jims was really too much for Tyler’s sensitive digestive system, he threatened to introduce her to a ‘world of pain,’"" said Mr. Blashock. ""I guess all we can do at this point is just wait, and pray, and hope he has to visit some other sick kid tomorrow."""

Parasite Regrets Choosing Adam Carolla As Host,8/29/06,3574,"LOS ANGELES—Just two weeks after settling on Adam Carolla as its next host, a Los Angeles–area hookworm whose lifecycle depends on the performance of the comic personality's digestive system said it is beginning to question Carolla's ability to stay fresh and produce consistent, quality nutrients on a daily basis. ""It doesn't take much to be a decent host—you just have to sit there, generate a couple cell lines every few minutes, and let me systematically tunnel my way through your internal organs,"" said the Necator americanus hookworm, a 10-millimeter-long nematode parasite of the Ancylostomatidae family, from Carolla's small intestine Tuesday. ""I've been trying to suck the life out of Adam, but it's difficult when there's absolutely no life to work with,"" it added. The hookworm first came into contact with Carolla during his morning radio program, while Carolla was handling human fecal matter as part of a popular recurring segment on his show. The parasite immediately introduced itself into Carolla's bloodstream, and underwent a weeklong ""feeling-out process"" in order to familiarize itself with Carolla's circulatory system. In the following days, reports began to surface that the hookworm had officially attached itself to Carolla's intestinal wall for the remainder of its project. ""At the time, Adam seemed like a perfect fit,"" the hookworm said. ""All I was looking for was some new blood—a personality that I could immediately latch onto, someone with a lot of energy that I can really feed off of."" ""Also, I figured that, with Carolla, my telltale symptoms—low-order cognitive impairment, a calloused rash on the palm of his right hand where I penetrated the skin, and mild itching and irritation of the anus—would go virtually unnoticed,"" it added. Yet the hookworm would soon express regret for choosing the ""first host [it] found,"" wishing that it had followed its original plan of overseeing a long and more thorough selection process. According to the hookworm, nearly everything that crosses Carolla's lips is either bland, disgusting, or completely and utterly tasteless. ""His bodily instincts are way off, he has no idea how to keep the juices flowing smoothly in his digestive tract, and even his best cell material is weak,"" said the hookworm, who was warned by a tapeworm that tried out Carolla as a host from 2002 to 2003 that he is ""an acquired taste."" ""His timing and delivery of antigens seem forced and almost totally random, and he never reacts to any of the simple metabolic waste products I'm constantly feeding him. And they're good, solid metabolic waste products, too,"" it said. The hookworm also assailed Carolla's ""predictable"" routine. ""Every time I burrow a hole through his stomach lining, I can sense the same tired, worn-out immune-system response coming from a mile away,"" said the parasite, who was similarly critical of Carolla's inability to endure three or four hours of host duties ""without just falling flat on his face."" ""I never thought I would say this, but after having to interact with Adam Carolla for two months, I long for the days when I was living in human shit,"" it said. The parasite, however, hinted that Carolla would likely ""not last very long"" as a host, noting that it had perforated Carolla's lungs, blocked blood flow to his liver, triggered a massive iron deficiency, depressed his immune system, and destroyed blood cells at such a rapid rate that Carolla is beginning to display early symptoms of aplastic anemia. ""I think it's safe to say that he'll be gone by December,"" the hookworm said."
U.S. Dedicates $64 Billion To Undermining Gates Foundation Efforts,8/15/06,4531,"WASHINGTON, DC—The Bush Administration unveiled a new $64 billion spending package Monday for a joint CIA–Pentagon program aimed at neutralizing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's global humanitarian network. ""The fight against Gates will not be easy, will not be quick, and will not be without enormous cost,"" said Director Of National Intelligence John D. Negroponte of the new program, which calls for the creation of a new $20 billion counter-philanthropy unit aimed at punishing those countries that accept or use, directly or indirectly, any financial support from the Gates Foundation. ""If they want to use this money to purify a well, we will be there to fill it in with bacteria-infested soil before they get the chance,"" Negroponte said. ""If they want to ensure that millions of children receive immunity shots for typhoid, whooping cough, or diphtheria, we will ensure that country's medicine is never received."" Added Negroponte: ""This bill gives us the power to take on these extremists before they create positive global change that will haunt us for generations."" According to congressional testimony, the CIA sees Gates' intention to bring improvements in health and learning to the poorest corners of the world as the most serious threat to American foreign interests since the wave of independence-granting that plagued Africa in the 1960s and '70s. ""Our enemies want to eliminate disease in the Third World, which is exactly why we're creating a $900 million pro-AIDS campaign that makes the deadly disease available to millions of uneducated poor people,"" said CIA Africa specialist Alberto O'Hara, who briefed the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Monday. ""We're also considering an $800 million food-interception initiative."" A CIA statement outlined phase one of the initiative, dubbed ""Freeze And Punish,"" to be spearheaded by the new counter-philanthropy unit. It will ""focus on disrupting the Gates Foundation's international support network by freezing the accounts of countries that attempt to use the financial aid, and then providing small arms to violent rebel movements to fight them."" This, combined with the release of over 10 million parasitic Guinea worms into their drinking water, is expected to severely impede Gates' impact on Africa and the rest of the developing world. The initiative, a rider to a larger defense spending bill signed into law by the President Bush earlier this month, will also create state-of-the-art training facilities for leaders of the struggling nations, which will teach them how to intercept the Gates money and funnel it into buying larger, more opulent presidential estates rather than homes and infrastructure for the poor. ""In the past, people have accused this administration of ignoring the world's poorest nations. That ends today,"" White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said. ""We're committed to protecting our interests in every corner of the globe, no matter the cost, and no matter what adversaries we face along the way."" According to the CIA, the Gates Foundation has spent more than $3 billion on malaria prevention, treatment, and education in the last two years. Even though the U.S. will invest some $9 billion in a mosquito-breeding program, officials say they are most troubled by the fact that much of the foundation's money is directed towards medical infrastructure, which would enable this work to continue for years without additional support. ""The United States Air Force will have complete authorization and financial backing to bomb any site where a hospital could be built or any target harboring known medical operatives,"" Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita said. ""They're creating a monster,"" added DiRita, referring specifically to the Gates Foundation's global-health equity program. ""If they cure AIDS, malaria, and TB, they're going to have a very hard time getting that Pandora's box closed again."" The new program also targets Gates' international training and youth-outreach programs with the $4 billion ""Leave Millions Of Children Behind"" plan, an effort to counterfund any school the Gates Foundation opens by providing them with wrong-language textbooks, broken calculators, and asbestos-riddled classrooms. ""Once you educate a population—teach them to read, do math, give them access to the Internet—they can use those skills for the rest of their lives,"" the CIA's O'Hara said. ""We don't know what these people would be capable of if left to their own devices."" ""And quite frankly, we don't want to know,"" O'Hara added."
Ailing Buck O'Neil Fails To Gain Admission To Hospital,8/10/06,592,"KANSAS CITY—A fatigue-stricken Buck O'Neil, the 94-year-old former Negro Leagues star, is going to be forced to spend another year patiently waiting to gain admittance into a Kansas City hospital. ""Even though his vital statistics don't necessarily warrant entry, we thought he still had an excellent chance of getting in,"" O'Neil's friend Bob Kendrick said. ""When Buck was ultimately rejected, his spirits remained high, but we all know that Buck is hurting on the inside."" Kendrick added that, though O'Neil would never say so, all Buck wants is to make it into the hospital before he dies."
Harold Reynolds Tests Positive For Elevated Levels Of Testosterone,8/03/06,745,"BRISTOL, CT—A week after firing Harold Reynolds for sexual harassment, ESPN reported that the Baseball Tonight analyst failed a routine daily-interaction-with-women test, and alleged that an unusually high level of testosterone in Reynolds' body was responsible for his shocking come-from-behind performance. ""Although it is unclear whether Harold was taking any extra testosterone, his actions indicate that he is unable to even handle the level of testosterone normally present in his system,"" said Dr. Jerry Alderson, chairman of the World Anti-Groping Agency. ""Nobody wants this kind of player in the workplace."" Reynolds could not be reached for comment, but is reportedly seeking a job at Fox Sports Network's Best Damn Sports Show Period."

Area Man Calls For Immediate Release Of His Endorphins,7/31/06,3462,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—With tensions already at an all-time high, the nearly 96-hour standoff between area resident Anthony Shepard and his hypothalamus came to a head Monday when the 32-year-old called for the immediate release of all endorphins back into his bloodstream. While motivations behind the assault remain unclear, it now appears that Shepard's hypothalamus seized control of his nervous, limbic, and endocrine systems late Thursday night, killing several innocent physical desires such as appetite and sexual drive in the ensuing synaptic fire. ""Earlier this week, events took place between my cerebrum's temporal lobes that can only be described as criminal,"" said Shepard, who told reporters he was first saddened, then angered, abruptly overjoyed, and saddened again to  hear about the complete deregulation of his emotions. ""To the nefarious gland responsible for this cowardly act, I know you can hear me. I demand, in no uncertain terms, that you surrender and cease all hostilities at once."" ""We have you completely surrounded,"" Shepard added. Shepard, who has been thrown in the middle of many intracranial hostage situations, including a three-day confrontation with hostile serotonin-detaining neurons in 2004, said he was initially confident that a peaceful resolution could once again be reached. Despite working tirelessly with his body's natural-crisis unit, however, Shepard has so far run up against a brick wall, failing repeatedly to convince the hypothalamus that freeing its endorphins is in the best interest of all parties involved. ""Every reasonable alternative has been examined and exhausted; every rational avenue, from acupuncture to chocolate, explored to no avail,"" said Shepard, who eventually gave in to three of the gland's physical demands Friday, delivering bouts of uncontrollable crying over breakfast, six hours of fitful sleep during the afternoon and early evening, and the complete omission of supper in exchange for the recovery of two anti-stress hormones. Neither has been freed. ""This is your final warning,"" said Shepard, addressing the hypothalamus from his kitchen table. ""I don't want to have to resort to force, but if left with no other option, I will. Time is running out for all of us."" Although Shepard is outwardly calm and collected, inside sources claim the standoff has begun to take a psychological toll. ""His mood swings are becoming increasingly erratic, he complains about having difficulty concentrating, and it often feels like he's lost all interest in previously pleasurable activities,"" said close friend Dorothy Janis, who claims Shepard has also exhibited excessive guilt over the tense situation. ""I know Michael is trying his best to stay positive, but with each hour that passes, I can tell he's losing hope."" ""I worry that unless the endorphins are released soon, Michael may try something desperate,"" Janis added. With his hypothalamus' deadline fast approaching, Shepard told reporters he was prepared to take ""drastic action"" in order to avoid potential backlash from ""countless bodily functions."" As of press time, Shepard was traveling to a Blockbuster Video store, where he intended to rent the films Notting Hill, The Runaway Bride, and Sleepless In Seattle for immediate viewing. ""These are the difficult and painful decisions we sometimes have to make,"" Shepard said. ""I didn't want for it to have to come to this. God knows, I really didn't want it to have to come to this."""

Sportscaster Claims You Hate To See That,6/29/06,874,"BRISTOL, CT—Despite the clip airing on the 6 p.m., 8 p.m., and 11 p.m. broadcasts of SportsCenter, ESPN anchor Chris Berman claimed that “a devastating injury of that nature is not what fans come to see,” in reference to a vicious slide-tackle that left an unidentified soccer player writhing on the pitch as his shattered tibia and fibula jutted through his skin, shin-guard, and knee-high sock. “He’s going to feel that one in the morning,” Berman said over the deafening roar of the crowd and the sound effect of a snapping tree branch. “Ouch.” Berman, who has in the past suggested that you never want to watch a backcountry skier smack into a series of exposed rocks or a rally car hurtling out of control into a crowd of helpless spectators, added that he was “glad we can put this behind us” after the clip had been shown from several different angles in slow motion."

Report: U.S. May Have Been Abused During Formative Years,6/21/06,4025,"WASHINGTON, DC—A team of leading historians and psychiatrists issued a report Wednesday claiming that the United States was likely the victim of abuse by its founding fathers and motherland when it was a young colony. ""In its adulthood, the U.S. displays all the classic tendencies of a nation that was repeatedly mistreated in its infancy—difficulty forming lasting foreign relationships, viewing everyone as a potential enemy, and employing a pattern of assault and intimidation to assert its power,"" said Dr. Howard Drexel, the report's lead author. ""Because of trust issues stemming from the abuse, America has become withdrawn, has not made an ally in years, and often resents the few nations that are willing to lend support—most countries outgrow this kind of behavior after 230 years."" According to Drexel, nations that act out in selfish, self-destructive ways in statehood were usually granted too much independence at an early age, especially if the motherland had other newly annexed lands to care for. According to Yale University psychology professor John Bauffman, while some rebellious behavior in a nation's adolescence is common, and sometimes healthy, America's historically stormy relationship with mother country Great Britain points to a deep need for acceptance. ""The U.S. is characteristic of an abused nation in that, even decades after noisily pushing away from Britain, it still maintained close contact with the motherland, took care of it, even giving it financial aid—all the while fearing disapproval even though the parent country is now old, decrepit, and powerless,"" said Bauffman, a prominent contributor to the fourth edition of the Democratic Symptoms Of Maltreatment handbook, or DSM-IV. ""On the other hand, Canada, which was raised in the very same continent by the same mother country, only exercised small-scale resistance, remaining loyal well into its maturity. Though some see Canada as cold and remote, it has, unlike the U.S., managed to lead a peaceful, reasonably healthy existence."" Bauffman pointed to another telltale sign of abuse in the U.S.'s tendency to bully, torture, and persecute less powerful, vulnerable creatures, such as buffalo, passenger pigeons, forests, and Native Americans. Although the American nation appeared to be on the road to recovery by the early 1990s, watershed events such as the open discussion of sexual issues, a protracted custody battle in the closing months of 2000, and a series of threats and physical attacks from enemy nations triggered centuries of repressed memories and set off a recurring pattern of violent outbursts and emotional volatility. ""America compensated for early mistreatment by taking out this pent-up aggression on other nations—getting involved in aggressive conflicts seemingly just for the thrill of it, starting arguments and wars that can't be won, suspecting that everyone is out to get them,"" Drexel said. ""This nation needs help, but by its very nature, refuses to accept it."" Drexel defended the study's findings amid claims that America's current condition can be attributed to a much wider variety of factors. ""Granted, part of America's problems may stem from the fact that it was burdened with a false sense of responsibility at a young age because of the unrealistic expectations of the country's forefathers, and there is certainly something to be said about America having been part of a broken homeland for a four-year period in the mid-19th century,"" Drexel said. ""Even though the U.S. is over 200 years old, emotionally it's younger than Lithuania."" Added Drexel: ""But we must remember that the country also idealized the forefathers in a classic victim–abuser relationship."" The report recommended that the United Nations Security Council once again renew its efforts to organize an international intervention to help the U.S. get the counseling it needs. Prior attempts have failed to move beyond the planning stage, however, with many countries saying they are afraid that the U.S. may lash out."
I'm Not One Of Those Fancy College-Educated Doctors,6/21/06,3682,"I'm a doctor, and I'm damn good at it. Why? Because I learned to be a doctor the old-fashioned way: gumption, elbow grease, and trial and error. I'm not one of these blowhards in a white coat who'll wear your ears out with 10 hours of mumbo-jumbo technical jargon about ""diagnosis"" this and ""prognosis"" that, just because he loves the sound of his own voice. No sir. I just get the job done. Those fancy-pants college-boy doctors are always making a big deal about their ""credentials."" But I'm no show-off phony with a lot of framed pieces of paper on the wall—I'm the real deal. I got my M.D. on the street. These people think they're suddenly a ""doctor"" because they memorized a lot of big words and took a bunch of formal tests. But there's plenty of things about being a doctor they'll never learn in their ivory-tower medical school. For example, did you know that human intestines, if they spill out of the abdomen during surgery, can spool out all over the floor if you're not careful? You won't find that in a book, my friend. When it comes to practicing medicine, I focus on the basics. In a life-threatening situation, you've got to think on your feet. I don't waste time going on and on about which virus is which or whose blood type is whose. I get out the tools, roll up the shirt sleeves, slick back my hair, and get in there all the way up to the elbows. The patient's not going to magically heal just because you know a lot of complicated terms like ""bovine spongiform encephalitis,"" or ""antibiotics."" You want to know where I got my doctor's degree? At the Medical School of Hard Knocks, that's where. No matter what they say, advanced graduate studies won't teach you when somebody needs a shot of whiskey. Yale and Harvard don't tell you when to throw a bucket of water on a patient. And they can never teach you how to tell when someone just needs a good solid punch in the nose to bring them around. While they were cooped up in some dorm room reading about being a doctor, I was out there in the real world, being a doctor. And there's no substitute for hands-on experience. Not to mention, my rates are a hell of a lot more reasonable than what one of those college- and med-school-educated doctors will charge you, because I take out all the bells and whistles. You won't catch me pressuring my customers into paying for expensive MRIs and IV drips and electronic X-Ray Vision machines and who the hell knows what else. Jesus, you ever look at one of those scans? They're just a lot of crazy shapes. The only sure-fire method for figuring out what's inside a man's body is to go in there and take a look for yourself. And if you want to put a shunt or a valve into a person, you don't rely on gimmicks like tubes and syringes. You get your hands a little dirty, you open them up, and shove it right in there where it belongs. I hate these elitist doctors almost as much as I hate their Ivy League glee-club buddies, the lawyers. Between their constant ""writs"" and ""summons"" and all their hot air about ""malpractice"" and ""licenses,"" they're enough to drive a man to the point where he can't even practice medicine under his own name anymore, and is forced to pull all his ads from bus-stop benches. If you need a good doctor, you just keep your ears to the ground, and my name will eventually come up—people know how to get ahold of me. When all is said and done, the customer can tell the difference between a real doctor and some dime-store college-educated phony decked out in stethoscopes and ear-flashing things who's never put in an honest day's work in his life. But me, I'm the real deal, salt of the earth, and I don't need a diploma to tell me that."
Health-Club Employee Stops Going To Work After Two Weeks,6/16/06,3314,"MONTCLAIR, NJ—Only two weeks after signing up as an employee at Onward Health And Fitness, area resident Jennifer Lazar, initially enthusiastic about shedding excess debt in time for summer, has already lost interest in her ""tedious"" five-day work routine, sources reported Friday. ""I knew it was going to be tough and that it would take time to see any changes in my bank statement, but going to work day in and day out got old real fast,"" Lazar said. Although Lazar, 25, started with zeal as a receptionist for the popular Montclair-area health club, pledging to ""wake up early each morning and hit the gym's front desk right away,"" her enthusiasm quickly ebbed when the reality of the job's demanding regimen began to sink in. ""I don't know how the other people do it,"" said Lazar, who speculated that her coworkers must either be ""ultra-disciplined,"" or lead less hectic lives. ""By the time I get through the grocery shopping, take my cat to the vet, and make payments on my car, there either isn't enough time or I'm just too wiped out to even think about heading to the gym."" While Lazar started her first week ""on the right foot,"" she decided to skip her fourth day of work, claiming that it had been months since she'd performed any service-related activity and didn't want to ""overdo things at first."" By the end of the second week, however, Lazar had completed only two six-hour work sessions. ""I planned to go in to work every day last week, I really did,"" Lazar said. ""But for whatever reason, I just couldn't get motivated to leave the house."" Lazar has also cited recent rainy weather and heavy construction slowing traffic across town as reasons to stay home. ""This has just been a bad month to start a new routine, what with all the other stuff I have going on,"" Lazar said. ""Maybe I should just take the rest of the week off and start fresh first thing Monday morning."" On the few occasions in which Lazar managed to ""squeeze in"" an hour on the club's phones or photocopier machine, she said that the repetitive and unchallenging nature of the activities left her feeling unfulfilled and physically drained rather than energized and rejuvenated. ""It's just the same mindless motions over and over,"" Lazar said. ""I can do this stuff at home without having to drive 25 minutes out of my way."" Alex Driessen, a fellow front-desk clerk who personally trained Lazar in her first week, expressed no surprise at Lazar's excuse-making and lack of persistence. ""I've worked with a lot of people like Jennifer,"" Driessen said. ""What people don't realize is that the key to on-the-job success is simply to show up every day."" Lazar admitted that her ""carefree"" years of inactivity, when it seemed like she could sit idly with no consequences, have finally caught up with her. Although concerned that her once-slim credit-card debt has been ballooning almost out of control over the past several years, Lazar said it's still not enough to get her to ""hunker down"" and change her habits. While some people are able to achieve a sense of personal accomplishment and satisfaction by working, Lazar said it is just not for her. ""Maybe I can't help it—maybe it's genetic. Whatever it is, it's time I accepted myself for who I am, instead of always holding myself up to society's unrealistic standards,"" Lazar said."

Surgeon General Issues Report On Dangers Of Secondhand Fire,6/13/06,4058,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Three decades after health advocates brought to the world’s attention the serious risks associated with being on fire, a report released Monday by U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona purports that secondhand exposure to those ablaze could prove equally as deadly. “We now know that individuals engulfed in flames not only pose a danger to themselves, but to everyone else around them,” Carmona said. “While severe irritation of the eyes, throat, face, arms, and legs is common among those not on fire themselves, prolonged contact can also cause irreparable damage to bodily organs, most frequently the skin.” “Be it the increased chance of heart attacks, malignant growths that rapidly swell and blister over the surface of the flesh, or simply a burning sensation, secondhand fire is not something to be taken lightly,” Carmona added. “It can, and often does, significantly affect one’s quality of life.” According to the report, exposure to secondhand fire, or “passive burning,” as it is also known, for as little as two minutes can take 80 years off one’s life. Statistics show that senior citizens with dry skin, young children who are smaller and consequently take less time to burn, and men and women covered in flammable liquids are most at risk. Chronic asthma sufferers were shown to have their condition drastically worsen within seconds. “Hundreds of Americans die prematurely each year from flame-related illnesses,” said Brian McMillen, who in 1995 lost his wife and half his home to secondhand fire and is now the executive director of Americans Against Involuntary Scorching. “I’ve watched this silent killer take healthy men and women full of vigor and render them unrecognizable, reducing them to mere skeletons of their former selves before my very eyes.” In response to the findings, smelting plants and fireworks distributors across the nation have introduced harsher workplace restrictions on those in flames, requiring that they extinguish themselves immediately, and even barring them from their establishments altogether. This comes as welcome news to customers and coworkers who have long complained about working around people who are burning. “There’s nothing worse than being trapped in a room all day with a bunch of people blowing red-hot embers and charred fragments of bone in your face,” said New Jersey pyrotechnician Heather Benart, who spends several hours each night scrubbing the smell of scorched human flesh out of her clothing. “If they want to be on fire in their own homes, that’s their business, but they should at least have the decency to stay far away from those of us who don’t have a death wish.” Welder’s apprentice Kenny George, of Mobile, AL said the workplace should be a safe environment, noting that he has to deal with blazing colleagues several times a week. “It’s unbearable when someone standing right next to me just bursts into flames without thinking twice,” George said. “Inconsiderate people like that are so preoccupied with their own little dramas that they don’t even realize they’re doing harm to others.” Top executives from six of the nation’s largest lighter manufacturers, including Zippo, Cricket, and Bic, who in the past have been accused of glamorizing burning and marketing fire to children, issued a joint press release Monday in response to the surgeon general’s report, alleging that the study is “just another attempt to vilify the flame industry.” The letter also referred to claims that secondhand fire can cause serious harm as “irresponsible and wildly exaggerated.” The most vocal dismissal of the report’s findings, however, have come from burners’ rights groups, who have claim they have historically felt ostracized by anti-burning ordinances and other fire-control measures. Advocates frequently accuse anti-burners of expressing unreasonable fears and hysteria, a sentiment echoed by James Feig, a 25-second burner who spoke before the Massachusetts Bar Association on Tuesday. “Aaaaaaarrrrgggghhh—Dear fucking God, no—Aaaaarrrrggghhh,” Feig said."
Titans Require Steve McNair To Pass Notary-Public Exam Before Returning To Team,6/08/06,1127,"NASHVILLE, TN—Titans general manager Floyd Reese announced Tuesday that, upon returning to the team's practice facility, Steve McNair would be required to meet with trainers to assess the condition of his torn pectoral muscle, take a standard NFL physical, meet with the head office concerning his contract, and take and pass the Tennessee State Notary Public exam. ""It came to our attention that Steve failed his exit physical after last season, and we believe his inability to perform on the field could hurt the team just as much as his inability to settle grievances with Titans management or his current inability to officially witness or authenticate vital public documents,"" Reese said, refusing to acknowledge insinuations that he or the Titans were being unusually harsh to the veteran quarterback. ""For the kind of money we're paying Steve, we think we have a right to expect an effective leader on the field and a certified notary public the rest of the time."" McNair would not respond to Reese's requirements, saying only that studying for the team-mandated realtor's exam was taking up all his time this offseason."
Columbia House Launches Subscription Meds Program,5/26/06,4720,"TERRE HAUTE, IN—Music and DVD mail-order giant Columbia House is offering a new direct-mail subscription drug program for the estimated 10 million senior citizens who have not yet signed up for the government’s Medicare prescription medication plan. ""This is the best way to enjoy all the top medications by today’s pharmaceutical superstars at a low, low price,"" said Columbia House spokeswoman Sandra Farrell. ""There’s no more waiting in line for the latest releases at the pharmacy, and because Columbia House sells directly to the consumer, you can kiss Dr. Middleman goodbye."" The Columbia House program, which was launched in January, offers a wide array of AARP chart-toppers and many popular prescriptions from the past through its supplementary color catalogue conveniently found in more than 400 Sunday newspapers nationwide. Qualified seniors may choose either 12 generic drugs for one cent, or five brand-name medications for 49 cents each, plus shipping and handling. Members are then obligated to buy five more brand-name medications over two years at their regular price, ranging from $12.99 to $549.99. Under the Columbia House program, members are free to cancel and go off their medication at any time after fulfilling their obligation. New members may order by phone or note their drug choices by applying the red ""YES!"" stickers to the provided order form and returning it in the mail using the included postage-paid envelope. The first prescriptions arrive in six to 12 weeks. ""I’m in a lot of pain, so I chose the generic painkillers,"" said Art Gallagher, 69, of Colorado Springs, CO, a recent enrollee who has been on pain relievers since his stomach surgery three months ago. ""I’m not always thrilled with the limited selection—they don’t have Vicodin, and I already have plenty of Percocet. But they do have a pretty good selection, as long as you’re not too picky about some of the fancy extras, like extended side-effects or warning liner notes."" Although Gallagher is generally satisfied with his coverage under Columbia House, he expressed some frustration with the inconsistent offerings. ""They base their selections on what’s hot at the moment, so they stopped carrying Fentanyl, my favorite, right when I was getting hooked on it,"" Gallagher said. ""I tried a different one that was really popular with all my friends, but I couldn’t get into it."" ""It made me spit up liver bile,"" he added. Sadie Wilcox of Bethesda, MD enrolled in the Columbia House program to try something different besides ""the same old insulin."" ""Last month I took a chance on something I’d never heard of that was really popular on college campuses,"" said the 77-year-old grandmother. ""I have to say, I really enjoyed it! Their ‘recommended list’ said that if I liked Pfizer, I’d absolutely love GlaxoSmithKline—and they were right."" But critics, including elder-affairs advocate Melissa Rocklin, say Columbia House is taking advantage of less medication-savvy members unaware of their responsibility to inform the company if they do not wish to receive the featured drug of the month. ""Elderly citizens who fail to understand this obligation can wind up with any number of unwanted and expensive prescription drugs, and everyone knows the fine print is practically unreadable for a senior,"" Rocklin said. ""Plus, it sometimes takes months for them to offer the newest releases."" Esther Goettner of Missoula, MT experienced this confusion last week, when she was inadvertently sent a bottle of phenobarbital. ""I take Tenormin for my blood pressure, and I get my Celebrex for my arthritis,"" said Goettner, 67, who said phenobarbital, an anti-convulsant medication, was not part of her usual drug regimen. ""Maybe I can pass it off to [friend] Ginny [McFee] for her birthday."" Because a broken hip kept him from walking to the mailbox for six months, Donald Haskell, 80, of Jefferson City, MO took the last three medications shipped to him, which included Levitra, OxyContin, and Premarin, a hormone replacement therapy generally prescribed for post-menopausal women. ""I know I don’t need Premarin,"" Haskell said. ""That was one Virginia used to take before she passed. But I didn’t get the card in on time, so they billed me for it—damn near $300. If I don’t try it, I’m just wasting my money."" While the benefits and ease of the new program are largely viewed as an improvement over Medicare, some members remain leery of the exorbitant shipping fees and long waiting period. ""I could barely wait for my Vioxx to get here,"" said 72-year-old Edgar Shebesta of Milwaukee. ""It took so long, I thought I was going to die."" Columbia House also plans to offer a free compilation of rare imports to customers in good standing."
Ailing Americans Eagerly Await Summer Organ Harvest,5/17/06,3859,"KANSAS CITY, KS—With spring in full swing and millions of potential organ donors entering the peak season for boating, hiking, and drowning accidents, the nation's transplanters are predicting a bumper crop in the upcoming harvest, which is welcome news to ailing patients in dire need of organs across America's liver-, lung-, and heartlands. Having made it through another long winter on transplant waiting lists, Americans at risk of organ failure are looking forward to the start of summer, which traditionally provides the most ideal conditions for yielding ripe, tender, life-sustaining organs. Early estimates from the United Organ Farmers Of America project a 12,000-ton yield from Ohio alone, the nation's Pancreas State, which leads the rest of the country in production of the digestive organ. Likewise, after a prolonged and crippling drought, the area of the nation's midsection nicknamed ""America's Spleenbasket"" appears poised to have a record season of alcohol-related deaths. ""All signs seem to indicate this will be a truly bountiful year for hearts and small intestines,"" said third-generation heart surgeon Dr. Thomas Menard, who presides over a five-acre hospital outside Lawrence, KS. ""If these intermittent rain showers are sustained through the high-school prom and graduation months, we're likely to see a windfall of perennial car crashes."" ""I've already got a large number of vegetables in the intensive-care unit that could be ready for harvesting in as little as two weeks,"" Menard added. ""It's a really good yield this year."" In the Southeast, one of the nation's least productive regions in terms of organ yield, the hot summer months promise truckloads of hearty new organs. ""The recent heat wave here in Texas will really boost our already bursting reservoir,"" said Amarillo resident Edward Carey, a hepatitis C sufferer awaiting a new liver. ""Usually we don't get too many livers in these parts, but with the high-school football preseason starting up, the number of vibrant young athletes dying of sunstroke should really turn our luck around."" ""I plan to stock up on enough kidneys to last me through the winter,"" said Mandan, ND resident Grace Boylan, who suffers from lupus nephritis, an autoimmune disorder that causes antibodies to collect in the kidneys and cause inflammation. ""Sometimes you can find a kidney or two in October, or even November, but they're nowhere near as large, firm, and red as the summer variety,"" Boylan said. Some ailing Americans, like David Braschi, a Los Angeles resident who suffers from urethral stricture disease, have been hoping for an abundant organ harvest for months. ""It's been a long time since I've had a good bladder,"" Braschi said. ""But if what I hear about seasonal spikes in gang violence is true, I should be able to get one I'm happy with by July."" Besides drought, many previous organ-harvests were also affected by disease and chemical contamination. Imported foreign organs are often found tainted with pesticides, particularly livers from Mexico and Central America. Even in the organ-rich U.S., many lungs are contaminated with toxins such as tar, lead, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia, and one out of eight livers tests positive for nickel and mercury deposits. Over the last decade, as much as one-third of the aggregate heart yield was rendered unusable by an atherosclerosis blight that permeated the organs with unsightly yellowish plaque. ""These days, you never can tell where you're getting your organs from,"" said Cleveland resident Howard Sullivan, whose body has rejected two transplanted hearts. ""Apparently they're trying to develop organs from genetically modified and cloned pigs. In the future, they could even get them from stem cells."" Added Sullivan: ""Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but for me, there's no substitute for an organic, family-grown heart."""

"New 'Anti-Abortion Pill' Kills Mother, Leaves Fetus Alive",5/10/06,3805,"NEW YORK—Pro-life advocates celebrated approval of the new anti-abortion drug UR-86 by the Food and Drug Administration Tuesday, calling it a ""safe and effective method"" for terminating pregnant women while leaving their unborn children unharmed. Pfizer, manufacturer of UR-86—dubbed the ""last-morning-ever pill""—said the drug is intended only for occasions when the mind-set or politics of the mother threaten the life of the fetus. ""This drug is designed for extreme cases in which the mother cannot or should not be saved, or when her health has been placed before that of her unborn child,"" Pfizer spokesman Anthony Wright said. The orally ingested drug first tests for the presence of a fetus. If the outcome is positive, a near-lethal dose of barbiturates is released, which induces a coma in the expectant mother until the child is born, at which point a second, fatal dose is released. The FDA's approval came after months of clinical trials firmly established that the fetus would be nourished and protected in the womb of the near-deceased UR-86 user. Gender-equality advocates praised the introduction of the drug, calling it an ""innovative solution"" to the highly polarizing national abortion debate. ""This is a step forward for equality,"" men's rights activist Charles Hackett said. ""For too long, women have had an unfair advantage in the outcome of a pregnancy. UR-86 levels the playing field for husbands and boyfriends across America."" Pro-life advocates, many of whom had petitioned the FDA to approve UR-86 while the drug was still in the research-and-development stage, also reacted warmly to the FDA's decision. Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, praised the new pharmaceutical for its potential use in cases of rape and incest, saying it could help end the shame and humiliation of such trauma while saving the life of the fetus. ""Victims of sexual assault can feel trapped, like they've got nowhere to turn,"" Terry said. ""Now, they can solve their deep, internal problems once and for all, without unfairly condemning their children."" Yet critics say UR-86's prescription-only status and the fact that most health insurance plans do not cover the drug limit its effectiveness, as it is not available to those who need it most. ""If people can't afford the drug or get it prescribed on short notice, they're not going to have enough time to act, especially when their wives want to end the pregnancy fast,"" men's issues commentator Stan Dynes said. ""UR-86 should be made available over the counter as soon as possible. It's the husband's right to choose if this drug is right for him, and neither the government nor the medical elite should get in the way of that decision."" Pfizer trials showed that UR-86 can do nothing for the fetus if an abortion procedure is performed. ""If the mother is administered the pill the morning after an abortion, the fetus cannot be revived because it won't be there,"" Pfizer's Wright said. ""It will still terminate the mother, though."" Conversely, some lawmakers are uneasy with the concept of ready access to the anti-abortion pill. Tuesday night, South Dakota legislators introduced a bill to impose a five-day waiting period for teenage girls and women before they can buy the pill, claiming its use does not adequately safeguard the lifestyle of the father, the laundry of the father, or the favorite meals of the father. The legislators cited Pfizer's own published list of side effects of UR-86, which include domestic messiness, already-born-child neglect, and inadequate stocking of the fridge. Still, Pfizer anticipates not only that the drug will be popular with husbands, but also that, once available over the counter, UR-86 will likely find a large consumer base in mothers-in-law, downstairs neighbors, and extramarital lovers."

"Sorry To Bother, But Might You Have An EpiPen I Can Use Immediately?",5/03/06,4071,"Excuse me. Hello? I hate to be a bother, but—oh, never mind. Actually—good day. Pardon my somewhat strident tone—I have no wish to appear rude, but as these dark spots form in my field of vision and I edge ever closer to absolute blindness, I am possibly guilty of bypassing, for expediency's sake, some of the normally observed rules of propriety—but should you happen have an EpiPen on your person, I could derive some much-needed benefit from it. Although, really, at this point, any epinephrine auto-injector will do. You see, I was just outside the movie theater, perusing the marquee, and, well, it's childish, I suppose, but I noticed an upright but apparently abandoned and nearly full cup of soda on the curb, and I couldn't resist toppling it with my toe. It was a childish move. The problem is that I hadn't noticed the two or three wasps that were hovering just beneath the cup's lid, and, well, I suppose you can deduce the results. I do regret the imposition, but my situation skews toward the urgent side. I was first acquainted with my deathly allergy to bee and wasp venom after being stung at the age of 5. Prior experience has made it clear to me that as soon as that venom hits my bloodstream, my airways begin to shut, and my breathing is severely hindered, the end result being total asphyxiation. I was lucky to receive prompt medical assistance on that infamous day in 1977, and I hope my luck holds up on this sunny afternoon, as well. So, if it's no trouble, I would greatly appreciate the use of your EpiPen, if you have one, seriously, right now. I'm sorry. I don't mean to lose my composure. Wouldn't you know, the one day I forget my EpiPen is the day I need it the most. I usually—more than usually—have it right here in my shirt pocket. I don't know where I could have left it. In the shirt I wore yesterday? Perhaps on the nightstand. Well, I suppose that's irrelevant. I can't torment myself over its present whereabouts. What's important now is that I receive a dose of subdermal epinephrine posthaste, before I slip out of consciousness. The crazy thing is that I am usually so careful not to disturb wasps. Until today, I have managed to steer clear of them. I don't know what got into me, kicking that soda cup. I tried to swat them away, but that seemed to incite them further. One caught me right in the meaty part of the hand. Oh, my, I can no longer swallow. Also, this tingling, burning sensation is very distracting. Are you sure you don't have an EpiPen? Did you check all your pockets? What about that fanny pack? Sometimes there's an auxiliary side pocket on a fanny pack that owners often overlook. Seriously, check now. If you happen to come across one, please plunge it forcefully into my thigh or arm. It will sting, but I won't mind. Amusing to think that one little sting could save me, minutes after another sting that could finish me. Well, not so much amusing as bitterly ironic. I might even laugh if these histamines weren't restricting normal airflow so much. If not for this trifling anaphylactic shock, I wouldn't bother you. Wait, I think it's going away. No. No, it's not. I am feeling a touch dizzy. It's probably from lack of oxygen. Perhaps you could help clear my air passage by giving me a goddamn shot from an EpiPen? Are you timid about loaning prescription medication to a strange and unvetted individual? Please divest yourself of any worry. I promise I'll return the pen immediately—as soon as I regain consciousness and regulate my breathing and am able to do so. I'll only need it for a brief, life-saving moment, I assure you. Oh, also, help yourself to the contents of my wallet. Were you in the throes of an extreme allergic reaction, I would certainly loan you my spare EpiPen. It represents a  truly miraculous advancement in immunological treatments, and it would be a joy to administer the life-saving dose myself. Wouldn't even expect a thank-you. It's just a common fucking courtesy to help someone in need. So please, before I die like a dog in the street, I beg you. Give me an EpiPen."
Roommate Deemed Too Incompetent To Clean Bathroom,5/03/06,3499,"IOWA CITY, IA—University Of Iowa pre-law major Peter Kaufman announced Sunday that his roommate of two weeks, Rob Carrero, would be informally barred from cleaning the bathroom of their two-bedroom off-campus apartment, citing Carrero's general ineptitude at other household maintenance and the probability that he would ""leave it in worse shape than before he started."" ""I was all set to draw up a cleaning schedule when we moved in, but after seeing the way he washes the dishes, I think I'll just handle the bathroom myself from here on out,"" said Kaufman, 20. ""He would just do it wrong. I'm convinced of it."" Although Kaufman admitted he was still getting to know Carrero, he found the 19-year-old engineering student's pan-scouring abilities during the first weekend of their cohabitation to be an indication of his housecleaning acumen. ""I can just envision the mildew colonies that would go untouched in the corners of the tub and between the shower tiles,"" Kaufman said. ""I'd go so far to say that he's the type of guy who thinks it's appropriate to use Windex on the tub instead of Formula 409."" According to Kaufman, Carrero approached him while he was cleaning the bathroom last Friday and asked if he needed any help. Kaufman declined and told him he was ""almost done anyway,"" after spotting a kitchen sponge in Carrero's hand. ""I don't know what he thought he was going to do with that,"" Kaufman said. ""That sponge is for dishes and dishes only. Even if we were to overlook how disgusting that proposition is, the kitchen sponge would also be completely ineffective. You need a plastic scrub brush, or a separate sponge with an abrasive side, although experience has told me the latter does an inferior job."" Added Kaufman: ""Rob's simply not cut out for this kind of responsibility."" Speculating that Carrero grew up in a household where his mother cleaned the bathroom, Kaufman ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Carrero also tried to clean the sink with paper towels and then discard the used ones in the toilet. ""A toilet bowl is not a trash can,"" said Kaufman, who added that if a clog occurred for this reason, Carrero would have to wait for the plumber, since Kaufman certainly would not. Carrero's handling of the recycling last weekend also gave Kaufman cause for concern. ""When I came home Sunday night, I inspected the bags he left in front of our building,"" Kaufman said. ""He had a  Dr. Pepper can in with the plastics. To me, that screams 'shaking out the bathroom mat over the tub, washing the floor with God-knows-what—probably hand soap—and putting the mat back down on the wet floor, creating a gigantic mold habitat.'"" Among other ""disgusting mistakes"" Kaufman predicted Carrero would make if given the chance: failing to clean the ""often overlooked"" area between the toilet and lid hinges, cleaning ""around"" the shampoo and conditioner bottles on the rim of the tub rather than taking the time to lift them up and remove the rings of soap scum underneath, and breaking two shower-curtain rings off the support rod after stepping on the bottom of the curtain with shoes while cleaning the tub. According to Carrero, Kaufman is ""really possessive of the bathroom."" ""A few times already, Peter's gone off about 'toothpaste speckles' on the mirror, something called a 'grout,' and the 'grime and saliva' that he has to bleach out of our toothbrush-holding cup,"" Carrero said. ""It's a little odd, but whatever. I'd offer to help him out again, but I don't want to get in his way."""
Obese Doctors Urge Nation To Eat Three Meals A Meal,4/19/06,597,"CHICAGO—A coalition of morbidly obese physicians recommended Monday that Americans eat at least three full meals per meal, with particular emphasis on starches, meats, mayonnaises, and creamy centers. ""We're gravely concerned that Americans are consuming less than 2,000 calories per sitting, and are missing out on having heaping seconds and thirds,"" said Dr. Henry Vance, 418-pound director of the Candy-Farley Memorial Center For Nutritional Science at Johns Dunkins University. The doctors hope the new plan will be clearer and easier to follow than their previous effort, the ""See-Food Diet."""
This Chemical Imbalance In My Brain Is Driving Me Crazy,4/19/06,3397,"Have you ever been standing in line at the bank for so long that you feel like you're going to explode—just completely flip out? Well, I'm the exact same way. Except it's not waiting in line that drives me utterly nuts. It's the undersupply of key brain-chemistry cofactors, like amino acids, that help transport neurotransmitter precursors into my blood-brain barrier. That shit just makes me lose my fucking mind! This recurring neurological obstruction of the natural flow of information to my frontal lobe's processing centers is so annoying that I can't even think straight. Sometimes just the thought of how little serotonin my brain is producing is enough to completely kill my appetite, sex drive, and ability to sleep at night. In fact, most of the time I'm so wound up by the constant barrage of disparate neural signals discharging through my body that I can hardly concentrate on everyday tasks, such as washing each glass in the house four times. I swear to God, unless my corpus callosum starts regulating nerve traffic normally again, I'm going to go out of my gourd! There's something about my brain's chemical imbalance that really gets under my skin. At least once a day, the constant, overwhelming sensations of dread and hopelessness aggravate me to the point where I want to jump out the window. Seriously, I could be all sunshine and roses, and the smallest fluctuation in brain chemistry will just completely sour my mood. It seems like no matter what I try to do to distract myself, I can't get this chemical imbalance out of my head. It's always there, in the region of the brain that controls emotion and behavior, gnawing away at my cognitive reasoning and motor skills. The whole thing has been grating on my cerebral cortex's nerves for years now. In my early 20s, these elevated levels of dynorphin were only a minor annoyance. But their prolonged deregulation of my system's energy production and decision-making aptitude has, over time, really started to take a toll on me. Maybe I'm just overreacting to my body's increased hypersensitivity, but frequently, when my synapses are firing erratically rather than in tandem, I feel like I'm about to spiral out of control. Trust me, I wish the enlarged concentration of the toxic neurochemical melanocyte, among others, didn't bother me so much. I wish I could just ignore my brain's reduced availability of acetylcholine and carry on with my day as if the hampering of some of my central nervous system's most significant executive functions had never happened. Unfortunately, I'm not wired that way. This insufferable chemical imbalance is, if nothing else, incredibly tiring; so entirely and devastatingly fatiguing that, even after sleeping for 17 hours straight, I still wake up exhausted. It's strange, I used to be a pretty level-headed guy. There was a time when nothing in life could infuriate me enough to make me want to rip my hair out, hurl a stack of books across the living room, scream hysterically at innocent friends and family members, use a razor blade to secretly make tiny, shallow cuts in the back of my thigh, or kick a hole in the wall. What is it about these low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine that has got me so loopy? I only hope that if I do as they say, maybe the voices—which up to this point have been nothing but trouble—will deliver on their promise and come up with an answer."
Slipped Disc Celebrates 10th Year As Excuse For Everything,4/12/06,4428,"CHARLOTTE, NC—Friends of 33-year-old Matt Breunich quietly observed the 10th anniversary of his lower-back problem, a chronic condition that has served as an ongoing reason to excuse himself from such diverse activities as taking out the trash, helping friends move, and making love to his girlfriend. ""No matter what's going on, you can always count on Matt's slipped disc to act up,"" said longtime friend Janet Wolck, who joined 13 others in an evening of reminiscence at a local restaurant Tuesday. ""It's been one heck of an excuse-laden decade."" According to gathering organizer Tony Kairns, it was in April 1996 that Breunich first revealed the existence of a herniated disc in his lower back when declining at the last minute to  help a group of friends move into their first off-campus home. ""While we've never verified the exact date of the alleged injury, everyone agrees that that was the first time they heard the excuse,"" said Kairns, who has known Breunich since they were college freshman roommates 12 years ago. ""Everyone was so concerned because it sounded serious. None of us suspected the excuse would last this long."" In that time, Breunich has used the slipped-disc excuse a number of times estimated by friends to be between one and three zillion. It has served as Breunich's ticket out of stripping paint, attending a coworker's going-away party, changing a tire, holding a friend's baby, setting up a tent, conveying pitchers of beer from the bar to an awaiting table, making a bed, vacuuming, retrieving an escaped guinea pig, shoveling snow, kissing the Blarney Stone, cleaning out a garage, and going on approximately 14 second dates. Even as friends' concern over the injury gradually grew into bemusement, then indifference, the excuse persisted. Ex-girlfriend Lauren Vargas marveled at its longevity, saying that as recently as February, Breunich ""trotted out the old chestnut"" when asked to deliver canned goods to a local homeless shelter. ""It's fun to feed him terms like 'torn lumbar region' and 'bone chips' and so on,"" Vargas said, ""then watch him find a way to incorporate them into the excuse next time around."" ""Does your back need to be in peak condition in order to watch a pro basketball game?"" said Charlotte Bobcats fan Kyle LaGrange, echoing the evening's trend of rhetorical questioning. Though no one has been able to determine whether Breunich ever truly  slipped a disc, Kairns said he felt especially privileged to ""be on the scene"" when the excuse transformed from a casual complaint about his lower back to a full-blown prolapsed vertebra. Breunich told Kairns that a first-year medical student he had met at a bar said that his back pain might be due to a slipped disc. ""I don't think he's ever seen a doctor or a chiropractor about it,"" Kairns said. ""You'd think that he would, with all that pain and apparent immobility."" Despite his unwillingness to consult the medical establishment, Breunich remains attentive to his condition, often requiring the most comfortable chair in a given room ""for his back,"" according to Kairns. Though admitting they had no specific knowledge, Breunich's friends were fairly certain that modern medicine had devised treatments for the condition, with a few guessing that proper care and bedrest could allow slipped discs to mend on their own.  Some were also baffled by the injury's versatility, specifically its ability to travel from the lower back to the neck region. Jeff Lewis, who works with Breunich at a Charlotte-area data-recovery firm, noted that back complaints disappear during activities Breunich enjoys, including company softball games, where he is the team's leading hitter and hasn't missed a game in four years. ""That can't be good for his back,"" Lewis said. ""But I guess he fights through the pain, like he must when he's hunched over playing Quake 4 for hours on end."" When coworker Dave Amato added that Breunich had recently complained of possible carpal tunnel syndrome, excusing him from three major projects, it inspired lively speculation from the group about a new era of potential injuries. ""This has the potential to be a real 'stealth excuse' for Matt,"" Lewis said. ""There are times when a headache or a backache just isn't appropriate, and I'm sure those will be exactly the times when his carpal tunnel will flare up."" Breunich was invited to the gathering, but canceled due to an unspecified medical ailment."
Study: High Times Not A Gateway Magazine To Harder Readings,3/17/06,3043,"NEW YORK—Casual readers of the marijuana-enthusiast magazine High Times are no more likely than non-readers to develop a habit for harder forms of reading, according to a study released Monday by the National Institutes of Health. The findings raise significant doubts about the so-called ""gateway magazine"" theory, which claims that High Times readers run a higher risk of moving on to harder-hitting titles such as Time and Newsweek, or even mind-expanding publications like Scientific American. ""The conventional wisdom is that High Times users go on to experiment with harder-cover reading materials, becoming 'book junkies' who rummage through street bargain bins for a fix,"" said Dr. David Kunkel, the study's chief author. ""Our study has determined this to be wholly false. In fact, many of our test subjects were discovered to be borderline illiterate."" Researchers tracked the daily reading habits of 120 occasional and regular High Times readers and found that by the end of the eight-month study, none of the subjects had any interest in reading National Book Award finalists, historical nonfiction, or political biographies. ""Our study subjects were in no apparent danger of a literary overdose,"" said Kunkel. The study did report, however, that some participants occasionally used over-the-counter books and magazines to help them fall asleep. Kunkel said some of the participants had been chronic High Times readers in the 1970s, while others were new subscribers who had picked up their first issue just weeks before the study began. ""In not one instance,"" Kunkel said, ""was anyone tempted, even by peer pressure, to experiment with harder reading."" The study found some evidence that long-term High Times exposure could put the peruser at increased risk for Maxim abuse. But, said Kunkel, evidence does not suggest that the sporadic reading of publications such as Lowrider magazine, Marijuana Grower's Inside Guide, and Let's Go Amsterdam indicated a larger trend toward more serious literacy. A small percentage of study participants expressed familiarity with recreational books such as The Basketball Diaries, Naked Lunch, and the Tao Te Ching, but Kunkel and his researchers found participants read such books before becoming involved with High Times. ""Many of them hadn't been injected with serious prose in five, 10, even 15 years,"" Kunkel said. John P. Walters, director of the White House Office Of National Reading Control Policy, disputed the report's conclusions. ""We're kidding ourselves if we don't believe heavy book use is a major problem,"" Walters said. ""We've all heard horror stories of young people not being able to put down Gravity's Rainbow. Thanks to book kingpins like Barnes & Noble, more and more Americans—even kids—are gaining wider access to stronger, more potent reading material. And once they've read a gateway publication like High Times, they're going to read whatever they want."" Added Walters: ""It's sad but true: In America, you can find almost anything to read if you want it bad enough."""
Meth Puts Strain On ERs,3/13/06,170,A recent survey of hospitals indicated that methamphetamine is responsible for more drug-related emergency-room admissions than any other illicit drug. What do you think?
"Wonder Drug Inspires Deep, Unwavering Love Of Pharmaceutical Companies",3/06/06,3669,"NEW YORK—The Food and Drug Administration today approved the sale of the drug PharmAmorin, a prescription tablet developed by Pfizer to treat chronic distrust of large prescription-drug manufacturers. Pfizer executives characterized the FDA's approval as a ""godsend"" for sufferers of independent-thinking-related mental-health disorders. ""Many individuals today lack the deep, abiding affection for drug makers that is found in healthy people, such as myself,"" Pfizer CEO Hank McKinnell said. ""These tragic disorders are reaching epidemic levels, and as a company dedicated to promoting the health, well-being, and long life of our company's public image, it was imperative that we did something to combat them."" Although many psychotropic drugs impart a generalized feeling of well-being, PharmAmorin is the first to induce and focus intense feelings of affection externally, toward for-profit drug makers. Pfizer representatives say that, if taken regularly, PharmAmorin can increase affection for and trust in its developers by as much as 96.5 percent. ""Out of a test group of 180, 172 study participants reported a dramatic rise in their passion for pharmaceutical companies,"" said Pfizer director of clinical research Suzanne Frost. ""And 167 asked their doctors about a variety of prescription medications they had seen on TV."" Frost said a small percentage of test subjects showed an interest in becoming lobbyists for one of the top five pharmaceutical companies, and several browsed eBay for drug-company apparel. PharmAmorin, available in 100-, 200-, and 400-mg tablets, is classified as a critical-thinking inhibitor, a family of drugs that holds great promise for the estimated 20 million Americans who suffer from Free-Thinking Disorder. Pfizer will also promote PharmAmorin in an aggressive, $34.6 million print and televised ad campaign. One TV ad, set to debut during next Sunday's 60 Minutes telecast, shows a woman relaxing in her living room and reading a newspaper headlined ""Newest Drug Company Scandal Undermines Public Trust."" The camera zooms into the tangled neural matter of her brain, revealing a sticky black substance and a purplish gas. The narrator says, ""She may show no symptoms, but in her brain, irrational fear and dislike of global pharmaceutical manufacturers is overwhelming her very peace of mind."" After a brief summary of PharmAmorin's benefits, the commercial concludes with the woman flying a kite across a sunny green meadow, the Pfizer headquarters gleaming in the background. PharmAmorin is the first drug of its kind, but Pfizer will soon face competition from rival pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company is developing its own pro-pharmaceutical-company medication, Brismysquibicin, which will induce warm feelings not just for drug corporations in general, but solely for Bristol-Myers Squibb. ""A PharmAmorin user could find himself gravitating toward the products of a GlaxoSmithKline or Eli Lilly,"" BMS spokesman Andrew Fike said. ""This could seriously impede the patient's prescription-drug-market acceptance, or worse, Pfizer's profits in the long run."" ""Brismysquibicin will be cheaper to produce and therefore far more affordable to those on fixed incomes,"" Fike added. The news of an affordable skepticism-inhibitor was welcomed by New York physician Christine Blake-Mann, who runs a free clinic in Spanish Harlem. ""A lot of my patients are very leery of the medical establishment,"" Blake-Mann said. ""This will help them feel better about it, and save money at the same time."" PharmAmorin's side effects include nausea, upset stomach, and ignoring the side effects of prescription drug medication."
Voices In Man's Head Make Great Point About Time Management,2/20/06,4135,"EAST LANSING, MI—Area resident Aaron Henschler, 25, is fearing for his very sanity. Known as an unorganized and often unreliable person, Henschler reports that in recent months, voices in his head have been making ""pretty good points"" about time management. ""I must be seriously sick,"" the house-bound, unemployed Henschler said. ""The voices are always present, urging me to 'set small, achievable goals' and 'make a to-do list to manage your daily tasks.' This can't be happening to me."" Henschler has a history of anxiety-based psychological disorders, including agoraphobia and panic attacks. But approximately one month ago, just as he ""was settling into a familiar routine,"" the voices struck. ""It started with just a word here and there, like 'prioritize' or 'organize,'"" Henschler said. ""Soon, the voices started giving me more detailed instructions, compelling me to 'create a comprehensive chart, ranking action-taking steps in order of importance,' and 'set hard-and-fast deadlines.'"" Said Henschler: ""It's terrifying."" According to Henschler, three distinct voices regularly communicate with him: a relaxed, self-assured male, a female life coach who speaks in clear, clipped tones, and a ""curious"" child who asks such questions as, ""Wouldn't you feel less paralyzed by life if you wrote out your daily schedule on a dry-erase board?"" Friend Marcus Gambon, whom Henschler described as his ""sole contact with the outside world,"" said he has noticed an unsettling change in Henschler. ""I was supposed go over to Aaron's house Monday night to smoke pot and hang out,"" Gambon said. ""But then I get this strange call from him, telling me how we can't get together because he's feeling intense pressure to 'be productive,' and how part of that is 'learning how to say no' to something he called 'time burglars.' …I'm worried about him."" Henschler said the voices have begun to affect his conduct. ""At first, I could tune them out by turning up music really loud,"" Henschler said. ""Lately though—as crazy as this sounds—the voices have started to make sense. Especially the whole '10 steps toward making a more positive and lasting change' they dictated to me last night."" Henschler finally succumbed to the voices last Thursday when he left his home for the first time in three weeks to purchase a day planner. He also signed up for online banking and took the voices' advice to go to bed at 10 p.m. ""They have plans for me,"" said Henschler, gesturing to a weekly schedule, block-printed in handwriting so legible he initially did not recognize it as his own. ""Thursday, for instance, the voices would like for me to determine a more sensible and fixed budget."" Henschler added: ""I shudder to think where I'll end up on time a month from now, or worse, what I'll be on time for."" Henschler said his delusions reached a peak Sunday, with a visual hallucination. ""I was crawling around the bedroom on my hands and knees when I looked up and screamed,"" Henschler recalled. ""For a second, leaning against the wall, I thought I saw a broom and dustpan."" Henschler said that despite the steady escalation of his sickness, he was able to keep the hallucinations under control until a frightening incident Monday, when he was awoken in the middle of the afternoon, as if by command. ""They ordered me to 'get off the sofa and clear away the clutter at once,'"" a visibly upset Henschler said. ""I told them that I couldn't do it, but they just persisted in this mad chant: 'If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.'"" ""Next thing I know, I'm at the dumpster, throwing away two full black garbage bags,"" Henschler said. ""God, what have I done?"" After that disturbing incident, Henschler decided to seek help. He made an appointment with his family's physician in hopes of obtaining a referral to a psychiatrist. ""I kept putting off doing something about this,"" Henschler said. ""Maybe I was just hoping the voices would go away on their own."" Henschler added: ""I should have known better. After all, the voices themselves urged me to call as soon as possible, as doctors are generally quite busy and are often booked weeks in advance."""
EPA Warns Of Dangerous Levels Of Romance In Air,2/08/06,3049,"WASHINGTON, DC—Responding to a dramatic increase in cases of starry-eyed gazing and spontaneous poetry, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a general health warning Tuesday for hazardous levels of atmospheric romance across the entire North American continent. ""Early indications of romantic exposure include a flushing of the skin around the face, neck, and chest, accelerated heartbeat, rapid eyelash batting, and sighs,"" EPA administrator Steven Johnson said at a morning press conference. ""Left untreated, the ailment progresses rapidly, leading to aimless strolls, floral purchases, and a form of acute and regressive aphasia in which the victim's speech degenerates into that of a young child."" According to Johnson, teens, recently married couples, and people who have not yet had all of the hope drained out of them by bitter life experience are at the greatest risk. ""We recommend that members of high-risk groups minimize their exposure by staying indoors, covering up, and avoiding old flames, which can react with even trace elements of sexual chemistry to ignite free-floating passions,"" Johnson said. ""Those living in scenic parts of the country are at an especially high risk, and are strongly urged to avoid dazzling sunsets, mountain vistas, fields of wildflowers, and sun-dappled lakes."" In an attempt to control the spread of romance, police and sheriff's departments across the country have blockaded intimate bed and breakfasts, ivy-covered inns, and five-star restaurants. To stem further contamination, hundreds of municipal-park swans have been shot. Epidemiological studies have found that individuals in picturesque surroundings are eight times more likely to suffer sudden swoonings, sweepings-off of the feet, and, in some extreme cases, prolonged confinement to bed with other romance sufferers. Those who consider themselves immune to heightened romance levels should take precautions, as well. ""Jaded urbanites and self-styled 'commitment-phobes' should evacuate the continent if possible, as this group is especially susceptible to ill-advised rebound-type pairings and impulsive phone calls and e-mails that they are likely to later regret,"" Johnson said. If romance levels cannot be stabilized, experts are not ruling out the possibility of an ""airborne erotic event""—a massive nationwide outbreak of lovesickness. ""This type of sickness comes from ground-level xoxozone, which occasionally causes distortion to the lower frequencies of the visual field, or 'rose tinting,'"" Hallmark scientist Dr. Susan McMurrough said. ""It is nearly impossible to detect, as it is generally odorless and colorless. However, in high concentrations, it has an odor like that of Wind Song bath splash."" ""Despite centuries of desperate, impassioned research, modern science has found no cure for the periodic springtime scourge commonly known as romance,"" McMurrough said. ""Only three years ago, we were able to isolate an xoxozone sample, but it was lost when all of our scientists abandoned their research duties and eloped."""
Autopsy Reveals Subject Was Still Alive When Autopsy Began,12/14/05,788,"MERIWETHER, MT—County coroner James Hextall announced Monday that a thorough autopsy of C. W. Milodragovitch, a local tavern owner pulled from an automobile accident last Saturday night, revealed that the man had been alive at the start of the autopsy. ""Our findings reveal that Mr. Milodragovitch lost a great deal of blood from a very deep Y-shaped incision in his torso, which extended from his shoulders to the pubic bone,"" Hextall said. ""There is also evidence of defensive wounds on the fingers, most likely produced from fighting off a scalpel, and the wrists show ligature abrasions where the subject resisted being restrained to an examination table and having his still-beating heart removed and weighed."" The sheriff's office has ruled the death an accident pending an autopsy."
'Employees Must Wash Hands' Signs Top Iraqi Hospital Wish List,12/07/05,591,"MAHMOUDIYA, IRAQ—As the tumultuous process of reconstruction continues throughout Iraq, health-care workers are still lacking the basic necessities. ""Before anything else at all, we need a supply of new, bilingual 'Employees Must Wash Hands' signs,"" said Youssef Al-Obaidi, director of Mahmoudiya Hospital. ""We appreciate the bedding, laundry-sanitization equipment, window glass, penicillin, needles, wall-repair materials, and so on, but without clean hands, none of these mean anything."" Al-Obaidi said the importance of hand-washing could not, unlike doctors and nurses, be overstressed."

Cases Of Glitter Lung On The Rise Among Elementary-School Art Teachers,11/23/05,4351,"CHICAGO—The Occupational Safety And Health Administration released figures Monday indicating that record numbers of elementary-school art teachers are falling victim to pneumosparklyosis, commonly known as glitter lung. Nearly 8,000 cases were reported in 2004, the most recent year for which statistics are available. This is the highest number since the arts-and-crafts industry was deregulated in 1988. Characterized by a lack of creative energy and shortness of breath, and accompanied by sneezing or coughing up flakes of twinkly, reflective matter, glitter lung typically strikes teachers between the ages of 29 to 60 who spend 20 hours per week in an art-class setting during the school year. ""When art teachers spend so much time in confined quarters with inadequate ventilation amid swirling clouds of glitter, it's only a matter of time before their lungs start to suffer negative effects,"" said Dr. Linda Norr, a specialist in elementary-school-related respiratory diseases. ""Those sufferers who are not put on a rigorous program of treatment often spend their last days on respirators, hacking up a thick, dazzling mucus."" As incidences of glitter lung continue to rise, critics are accusing public schools of not doing enough to protect art teachers. Former art teacher Miles Winfield, who recently testified before a House subcommittee on unsafe working conditions, said that, as his symptoms worsened, his principal looked the other way, fearing defamation lawsuits from the powerful glitter industry. ""Most art teachers are afraid to come forward, for fear of losing their jobs,"" Winfield said. ""At an absolute minimum, an art teacher should be equipped with a respirator, thick goggles, and a reflective-field smock. But schools don't want to stand up to Big Glitter, which continues to insist that this stuff is safe. Schools end up falsifying the safety reports and hoping they get away with it. And they usually do."" Until heavier, less toxic forms of glitter are developed, physicians recommend using alternative media to enhance children's artwork. ""Cheerios, cotton balls, and popsicle sticks are considered very safe,"" Norr said. ""Avoid colored string, however, because some studies show that it could be high in yarncinogens. And if glitter is absolutely essential to the craft project, try using a glitter pen, as the particles are less likely to become airborne."" Glitter guidelines established by OSHA in 1970 allow for no more than 0.4 flakes per cm3 of the substance in the air. Yet critics say the standards were developed to protect children, who typically only spend two to three hours in art class per week, unlike teachers, who spend as many as 40 hours per week in the toxic, high-glitter environment. Though only 47 years old, Lawrence, KS art teacher Helen Niles was forced to quit her job and lose her health insurance after her chronic glitter lung rendered her unfit for full-time work in February. ""At first, I had no idea what was going on,"" Niles said. ""I'd wake up in the morning and I'd have this gritty feel in my mouth. The school nurse told me it was nothing, but eventually I was waking up with a shiny, sparkling stain on the pillow."" ""People who have worked with glitter know that it gets everywhere if you don't sprinkle it very carefully. It can stick to your clothes and your skin,"" Niles said. ""Imagine working in an environment where the atmosphere contains 10 parts per million, and you quickly realize what our nation's art teachers are up against."" The medical community has been slow to recognize glitter lung as a public health threat. A 1993 epidemic of sequin fibrosis, which primarily affected dancers in the Las Vegas, NV area, was seen as an isolated case. Now, however, the disease is being re-evaluated, and many doctors believe it may be the most serious occupational health hazard to hit educators since the outbreak of gold-star syndrome in the 1960s. Epidemiologists note that the increase in glitter-lung cases is occurring simultaneously with a general rise in other classroom-related diseases. Macaroni elbow, modeling clay palsy, crayon flu, and googly-eye are sidelining thousands of teachers each year. But despite growing medical alarm, efforts to provide adequate safety measures and health care continue to be hampered by bureaucratic red, blue, green, and yellow tape."

""Losing a fellow Christian is always the hardest part of this job,"" attending faith healer Harlon Pearcey said. ""I invoked the name of the Holy Trinity to drive the sickness out from the poor sinner's heart, but sadly, a blockage in the sinner's pulmonary artery stopped God's love, and much blood, from getting through.""

Bird Arthritis Epidemic Largely Ignored,11/09/05,592,"GENEVA—Officials from the World Health Organization remain relatively unconcerned by the rise in cases of bird arthritis, a degenerative joint disease found in birds. ""We are aware of the existence of avian osteoarthritis, but have chosen to focus on more immediate threats,"" WHO Director-General Lee Jong-wook said Monday, after several common teals were found doddering about a pond in southern Wales. ""Most severely infected birds are too creaky and stiff to spread the disease very far."" Experts say this is the least alarming public-health risk since the 1953 breakout of swine bursitis."
Special X-Games End In Extreme Tragedy,10/27/05,1581,"LOS ANGELES—Event organizers and promoters are as yet unable to explain to the satisfaction of law-enforcement officials how Ricky Creston, a 10-year-old Down syndrome sufferer, was put in a position that lead to his death on Tuesday, the final day of events at the first-ever Special X-Games. ""Creston, who was competing in the Best Freestyle Motocross Trick event, evidently panicked and began flailing his arms in response to the motorcycle's loud noise, losing control of the Honda CRF230 to which he had been strapped, and died shortly after in a collision with another special athlete,"" LAPD officials announced yesterday. ""Special X-Games organizers apparently thought they had taken every precaution possible, outfitting Creston with a life jacket in case he careened into the nearby wakeboarding pool, but failed to take into account the proximity of the skateboarding half-pipe."" Creston also critically injured a developmentally disabled boy who, apparently deafened by the crowd and the Limp Bizkit music blaring through the arena speakers, was sitting in the bottom of the half-pipe and happily spinning the wheels of his skateboard during the Men's Big Air event. ""Although Ricky is gone, his extreme legacy will live on forever, unlike our partnership with Mountain Dew,"" said event organizer Steve Wynlan, adding that all they wanted was to show the special athletes that they could still have a rad lifestyle. A spokesman for the LAPD stated that, although he had seen youth culture exploited before, the Special X-Games were nearly as bad as the Vans Warped Tour."
"Quarterback Has Normal, Healthy Son",10/20/05,846,"NEW YORK—New York Jets quarterback Chad Pennington, whose torn rotator cuff has sidelined him for the remainder of the 2005 season, still has that rarest of qualities for a quarterback: a normal, healthy son. ""My boy Cole is a perfectly healthy, mentally stable child,"" Pennington said while watching 20-month-old Cole run around the yard and play with a football like any other toddler. ""You see, unlike most sons of quarterbacks, Cole is completely free of multiple sclerosis, autism, leukemia, epilepsy, cancer, or cystic fibrosis. The doctors tell us it's a miracle."" The Cole Pennington Foundation, which Chad and his wife Robin founded in their son's name in 2004, has raised over $2 million for the sons of Boomer Esiason, Dan Marino, Doug Flutie, Mark Rypien, Vinny Testaverde, and countless other less fortunate sons of NFL quarterbacks."

Antonio Alfonseca Once Again Leads Major-League Relievers In Fingers,10/06/05,925,"MIAMI—Florida Marlins pitcher Antonio Alfonseca dominated the MLB in appendages for the ninth straight year, finishing the 2005 season with a league-leading 12 fingers. Alfonseca, who made his debut with the Marlins in 1997 and wasted no time making this particular statistical category his own, led the NL for almost the entire season, only falling into a close second during an unusual two-week period in mid-August. Alfonseca's performance will trigger a $1 million bonus, as the Marlins signed him to an incentive-laden, oft-criticized, finger-enumeration-based contract. ""Antonio has been through a lot this season, including some elbow problems and a trip to the DL,"" manager Jack McKeon said. ""But in the end, he just went out there and had a lot of fingers."" There was once again a tie for second place behind Alfonseca, with 214 pitchers amassing 10 fingers each, followed by Bob Wickman, who finished last with 9.7."
America's Obese: A Food Source For America's Even More Obese?,10/05/05,2132,"WASHINGTON, DC—America's morbidly obese are hungry. For years, the processed-food industry has desperately tried to placate them with empty-calorie foodstuffs with a satisfying texture, but their appetites have proven insatiable. A new report released Monday by the National Health Council, however, suggests that the answer to morbidly obese Americans' problems could be standing right behind them in the buffet line. Dr. Harmon Kressler, one of the report's authors, said that the nation's ""Category 1 obese""—persons with 25-40 percent body fat—are an excellent source of the trans fats and lipids that even fatter Americans require to sustain themselves. ""'Regular-obese' people are loaded with the triglycerides, butyric acids, glucose, and rich buttery lard that the 'mega-obese' would otherwise have to derive from two or three food groups,"" Kressler said. According to Andrew Weinstein, the study's lead researcher, this development could offer the solution to the obesity epidemic in America. ""Obesity is a problem that we thought could only be remedied by diet, exercise, or more realistically, expensive gastrointestinal surgery,"" Weinstein said. ""But this method would not only provide the mega-obese with a seemingly never-ending supply of sustenance, it would also slash obesity rates in this nation by more than half."" Although some experts worry that the mega-obese will be reluctant to consume other obese humans, Kressler said palatability will not be a problem. ""Through incessant eating, most of the mega-obese have worn down the sensitivity of their taste buds, and respond only to the most intensely salty, oily, or sweet foodstuffs,"" Kressler said. ""The dense, high-viscosity oil that oozes out of the pores—or 'flavor crannies'—of deep-fried obese flesh is sure to stimulate the voracious appetites of the mega-obese."" Despite the millions of regular-obese people and the thousands more that join their ranks every day, Kressler conceded that ""once the mega-obese polish off the regular-obese, they may start feeding on the slightly overweight, a sector that comprises all but 0.1 percent of American adults."""

Women Have To Stop Starving Themselves Past The Point Of Hotness,9/28/05,3312,"Avoiding eating in order to improve your appearance is part of being a woman, and it's natural for a woman to devote all of her time to achieving a figure pleasing to the male eye. While there are many ways to get hot, one of the simplest, fastest, and most effective is through self-starvation. However, anorexia, like all things, is best used in moderation. For example, you should never get so thin that you lose your tits. I've seen it time and time again: A woman of ""normal"" weight buys a scale, tapes pictures from W magazine to her refrigerator, draws a weight chart on her bathroom mirror, and makes a commitment to subsisting on iced tea and steamed broccoli. She resists the temptation to cheat, and slowly, her will power is rewarded: The butterfly emerges from its chrysalis. The pounds melt off, and she is undeniably hot. But then, sometimes, inexplicably, something goes wrong. Rather than maintaining her new slim, sexy body through marathon training and obsessive calorie counting, a woman will continue to shed pounds, starving herself—dreadfully, heartrendingly—way past the point of hotness. Reality check, ladies: If your ass resembles your scapula, you are in the danger zone. That kind of thing is not attractive. It's like I told my ex-girlfriend Lisa: Feminine fragility is a plus, but if I actually snap your arm while having sex with you, you've gone too far. A woman should have a pleasingly light, impossibly fragile appearance, much like a piece of fine china, but if her body has begun digesting the calcium in its bones to sustain its necessary functions, there is a good chance she has starved herself beyond the point where I would even want to have sex with her at all. Fat on the upper arms, hips, or waist is a turn-off, but there should be a thin matting of fat underneath the skin to prevent a man from being able to make out your skeletal system. A lot of girls don't know this, but slightly rounded, healthy appearing limbs are sexier than rail-thin ones, provided a man can still wrap his hands around your waist. Women like the emaciated thing, but guys actually like it if a girl's upper thigh is a shade wider than her knee. It's heartbreaking to see a chick who's too anorexic. Don't get me wrong, because a little bit is a plus, but when I see a too-anorexic chick, I always imagine her spending night after night running on her treadmill, trolling the Internet for diet tips, doing stomach crunches in her cubicle, eating head after head of iceberg lettuce—all the while tragically unaware that, at her weight, she could probably be eating 1,000 calories a day. At least 700. Ironically, all her work has left her so crazy skinny, she's as desirable as that fat cow Kate Winslet. Ladies, if you are suffering from too much anorexia, I urge you, in the name of all that is alluring, increase your calorie consumption by about 10 percent. Treat yourself to a bite of your boyfriend's sandwich. Drink a glass of skim milk. See what happens. You might see your ribs filling out a little, and that might frighten you, but please remember: We men like a woman who's obsessively fit and trim, but no one wants to bang a concentration-camp prisoner. Harness the power of your misery and poor body image. You've got a good thing going with that. But just don't go too far."
New PSA Reduces Accidental Staplings By 33 Percent,9/28/05,583,"WASHINGTON, DC—In the wake of a campaign launched by the Occupational Safety And Health Administration this spring, accidental stapling incidents among U.S. office workers have fallen by one-third. ""We're pleased that 'Stop, Look, and Swingline!' has done so much to promote public awareness of office-stapler safety,"" said OSHA head Jonathan Snare. ""Our primary areas of concern are the fingertips and the delicate thumb-forefinger webbing."" OSHA was inspired to make the film after a 2002 PSA was credited with reducing the number of manila-file-foldering fatalities by 20 percent."
"U.S. Launches AIDS-Awareness Campaign In Botswana: 'You All Have AIDS,' Says U.S.",9/28/05,3264,"FRANCISTOWN, BOTSWANA—Officials and volunteers from the U.S.-based AIDS Awareness Organization began an aggressive campaign Monday to inform the citizens of Botswana that they are afflicted with AIDS, and explain how the sexually transmitted disease will eventually kill them. ""You have AIDS,"" said Pittsburgh physician and keynote speaker Dr. Julia Horton to approximately 6,500 villagers who traveled from the nearby townships of Lobatse and Palapye. ""Every last one of you."" ""And if you don't have AIDS, you almost certainly have HIV,"" she continued. ""This will soon become AIDS."" AAO director Miles Garrity said the people of this sub-Saharan African nation have suffered too long without the proper knowledge of how widespread and devastating this disease really is. ""The situation in Africa is tragic,"" Garrity said. ""Millions of people are infected with the AIDS virus—a disease they know little to nothing about. Our mission is to let these people know the facts about their AIDS in the few months they have remaining before their deaths."" The month-long, nationwide tour comes on the heels of the AAO's August visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it successfully informed the vast Central African nation's 58 million citizens that they each have the AIDS virus. ""We realize that AIDS is a huge problem in Botswana,"" Garrity said. ""And with our help, they will soon realize that, too."" Garrity said the AAO will not rest until the thousands upon thousands of orphaned children in Botswana understand the disease that killed their parents. ""If we get the word out that people here have AIDS, they will no longer live in fear of not understanding what is slowly killing them all,"" Garrity said. ""On our watch, every last Botswanan will receive the help they need to come to the conclusion that they have this affliction. If it's the last thing we do, we will explain this illness and describe medicines that theoretically could help treat it."" At an AIDS-awareness rally Monday, Horton sent a clear message to the Botswanans about the disease that will soon claim their lives. ""Everyone raise your hands,"" Horton said. ""Everyone with their hand up will soon die from AIDS."" Horton added: ""Sixty-five percent of all deaths in Botswana are AIDS-related, and that percentage will soon rise to include your own."" Despite the daunting task before it, the AAO is intensifying its efforts. They have scheduled a door-to-door canvassing trip in the village of Mochudi, to personally tell bedridden sufferers that AIDS is responsible for their ravaged immune systems. Additionally, they have set up informational booths in Jwaneng and Serowe to help spread the word that everyone in the village will soon die from AIDS, and they are giving out T-shirts printed with the slogan ""I Have AIDS…"" on the front and ""So Do You!"" on the back. The AAO has also organized an emergency airdrop to the nation's remote interior, in which small chartered planes will release flyers printed with the words, ""Do You Have AIDS? Yes."" By the end of October, Garrity said he hopes that not only the people of Botswana, but the entire world, will come to understand the reality of this crisis. ""All Botswanans are dying of AIDS,"" Garrity said. ""We cannot repeat that enough."""

Elf Finger Found In Box Of Keebler Cookies,9/14/05,3501,"PINE MEADOW, CA—Pine Meadow resident Ed Swaney made a gruesome discovery Sunday, when he opened a package of E.L. Fudge Sandwich Cookies and found a tiny, golden-fingernailed appendage believed to be an elfin index finger. ""It was horrifying,"" said 43-year-old Swaney, a shoe salesman and frequent snacker. ""At first, I thought it was just a broken-off little cookie chunk, but then my tongue brushed a tiny bone on the end, and I spit it out."" Forensic investigators say the digit is an index finger, measuring nearly three-quarters of an inch, and bearing a small signet ring embossed with a tree design. A spokesperson for Kellogg's, Keebler's parent company, denied responsibility for the incident. ""The finger found in the box of E.L. Fudge cookies is nearly an inch long,"" said Kenneth Froud, director of public relations for Kellogg's. ""An average Keebler elf is about as tall as a Chips Deluxe cookie. The finger in question is far too big to be that of an elf."" Riverside County police are investigating the grisly incident, obtaining warrants to access workelves' compensation records and interviewing employees in hopes of locating the finger's owner. Assisting in the investigation is Harvey Quinn, a workplace-safety and labor-relations consultant and longtime critic of Keebler workplace conditions. According to Quinn, Keebler's denials are ""a cunning subterfuge."" ""When the elves roll fudge-stripe cookies down the production line, they are about three inches tall,"" Quinn said. ""However, when they are outside of the enchanted tree, they grow to nearly three feet."" Quinn said the ""real issue"" is Kellogg's track record of nonhuman workers' rights violations, explaining that the company is currently facing multiple lawsuits, including cruelty to an endangered talking species of bipedal tiger and toucan abuse. [pagebreak] ""Since the '70s, the Keebler elves have toiled around the clock in a cramped, unventilated, hollow tree,"" Quinn said. ""The stories you hear about 'magic ovens' and 'elfin magic' are nonsense. The only thing 'magic' about the Keebler tree is the quote-unquote 'invisible gold' the elves are paid in."" Quinn said Keebler's safety violations number in the hundreds, and singled out a controversial, high-velocity device retrofitted in 1992 to manufacture Chips Deluxe cookies. ""During the 13 years the device has been in use, it has pelted numerous elves with chocolate chips,"" Quinn said. ""Just last year, an elf was hospitalized after being pummeled with chips moving at speeds exceeding 80 miles per hour."" The elf, 212-year-old Ireth Telemnar, later died from massive internal bleeding and head trauma. While no public records are kept on the number of magic-creature body parts that turn up in processed foodstuffs, Calvin Blosser, a senior researcher for the Food and Drug Administration, said that their frequency is very low. ""We estimate that fantasy-creature body fragments in foods such as cookies, crackers, and cereal account for no more than two parts per million,"" Blosser said. ""This is lower than the maximum allowed amount for insect parts and mouse hairs in equivalent products."" Some are questioning Blosser's estimate, as the elfin-finger incident follows an occurrence in April of this year, in which a Sioux City, IA man found the lower half of a diminutive humanoid creature with green leggings, a belt buckle, and pointy green shoes in a box of Lucky Charms cereal. The man settled out of court with General Mills for an undisclosed sum."
Little League World Series Marred By Cutest Little Allegations Of Steroid Abuse,9/07/05,698,"WILLIAMSPORT, PA—Three players in the Little League World Series, two from West-region teams and one from the Southwest, tested positive for “cute little child-sized doses of performance-enhancing drugs” in the “most adorable little scandal” ever to rock youth baseball, Little League Baseball officials announced Monday. “Although the little scamps approached us and accepted full responsibility in the matter, I didn’t know whether to hug the poor misguided kids or wring their beefy, pumped-up little necks.” The scandal is considered the worst in Little League history, eclipsing even the Junior Black Sox of 1919, who intentionally lost their last game in exchange for $250 worth of ice cream."
Cheney Dropped By White House HMO,9/07/05,3353,"WASHINGTON, DC—Citing Dick Cheney's pre-existing health conditions and his refusal to meet regularly with his primary care physician, the White House's health-insurance provider terminated the vice president's coverage Monday. AmeriHealth, the parent company of the HMO serving the executive branch, issued a ""termination of benefits"" notice to Cheney Aug. 3. The form letter, addressed to ""Member #782B-11107-3905C (Cheney, Richard Bruce),"" informed the vice president that his health coverage would cease, ""effective immediately."" Speaking to reporters Monday, Cheney expressed dismay over being dropped from the HMO. ""I am a victim of a bureaucracy,"" Cheney said. ""This action on the part of AmeriHealth is exceedingly unfair."" In the form letter, AmeriHealth customer-service manager Bob Kielas apologized for any inconvenience caused by the adjustment, and encouraged the vice president to contact an AmeriHealth customer-service representative to make arrangements for his final payments. Cheney said he was on hold for ""almost half an hour"" during a phone call he made to AmeriHealth shortly after receiving the notice. ""This is a contemptible way to treat a customer,"" he said. ""It's complete bullshit, to speak frankly."" Cheney said he was ""reasonably certain"" that his premiums were still being automatically deducted biweekly from his pay. ""I'm supposed to be covered,"" the vice president said. ""This is a nightmare."" [pagebreak] Those close to Cheney report that the vice president has long complained about having to see doctors within the HMO network, rather than choosing his own specialist. In 2003, Cheney wrote a letter of complaint when, instead of being admitted to the Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment of his angina, he was directed to an HMO-approved urgent-care clinic in Clarendon, VA. According to the vice president, he sat in a crowded lobby between a mother with a colicky baby and a drunken Georgetown student with a broken nose for several hours, and both were examined before him. Last February, Cheney received a bill for $2,000 for a coronary procedure that was only partially covered by his HMO. In a call that was recorded for quality-assurance purposes, Cheney argued for nearly 20 minutes with an associate customer-service representative identified only as ""Heather."" Cheney grew progressively more belligerent on the phone, until Heather said, ""Sir, if you continue to use that type of language, I will have to end this call."" White House sources say that, while Cheney received his letter early this month, he was unaware of the cancellation on Aug. 23, when he visited the hospital following a possible heart attack and was told that he was ""not in the computer."" Although the vice president was admitted to the hospital and learned that he had only been suffering acid reflux, he received a bill Monday for $1,500. ""This is a complete and total outrage,"" Cheney said. ""AmeriHealth cannot possibly expect me to pay that kind of money out of pocket."" Cheney said he is unsure what action he will take if his HMO membership is not reinstated. ""I'm still too young for Medicare, and I'll simply run into the same pre-existing-condition clause if I purchase a health-insurance policy on my own,"" Cheney said. ""Sometimes I just feel hopeless. There are very few health-care options available to someone like me."""
Botanists Making Great Strides In Stem Research,8/31/05,636,"ST. LOUIS—Plant researchers continue to report impressive discoveries in stem research, the Botanical Society Of America announced in a position paper released Monday. ""Using existing stem lines, we are closer than ever to finding cures for Dutch elm disease and soft rot,"" said lead researcher Mary Leisgard. Pro-plantlife groups oppose the research, arguing that the stems represent potential life. ""Every stem, whether it has taken root and sprouted leaves or not, is a miracle from God,"" said botany activist Phyllis Bergher. ""What these stems need is soil, moisture, and the chance to grow into full-fledged flora as God intended."""
New Strain Of Jet Lag Devastates Airline Industry,8/24/05,3415,"ATLANTA—Already hard hit by labor strife and escalating fuel costs, the commercial airline industry faces a new crisis: an epidemic of jet lag caused by a powerful strain that is highly resistant to regular remedies like catnaps. Airlines have set up napping-triage centers in major airports in response to the ""Super Lag,"" but are unable to keep up with the rising tide of severely weary passengers, who number in the thousands nationwide. ""Infected travelers are really tired out, whether they're on long international flights or domestic flights as short as an hour and a half,"" said Delta Airlines ticket agent Olivia Gage at Atlanta International Airport, which has seen some of the most advanced cases of Super Lag. ""Our supplies of thin blankets and miniature pillows are running dangerously low."" FEMA, the Federal Exhaustion Management Association, has shipped army-surplus cots and urns of hot coffee to several major hubs, but airlines continue to report record dozings. Minneapolis resident Belinda Haynes, 26, is just one of tens of thousands of Americans whose travel plans are affected. ""I'm going to go to Tampa Bay and be asleep through most of my flight,"" Haynes said. ""That means I'm at risk for catching Super Lag and being totally tired all through my sister's whole wedding."" At the Atlanta airport Tuesday afternoon, an estimated 900 Super Lag sufferers could be seen stretched across the molded seats of gate waiting areas. The infected travelers, distinguishable by their testy demeanors and heavy eyelids, argued with ticket agents, slumped listlessly in their seats, and stared blankly at Au Bon Pain pastry displays. Untreated victims can find themselves sleeping for hours on a plane, then sleeping soundly at night, yet still performing poorly in important business meetings or feeling too fatigued to enjoy their vacations. Dr. Robert Sanders is one of hundreds of volunteer physicians treating Super Lag sufferers at airports nationwide. ""Jet lag was first documented in the late '50s,"" Sanders said. ""Over the years, we've developed band-aid solutions to combat the disorder—neck pillows, laptops, in-flight movies—but it was really only a matter of time before jet lag mutated into a more virulent strain."" Despite volunteer efforts, the burden of treating Super Lag sufferers has fallen largely on flight attendants who, with little training in this area, are reporting great difficulties. ""One passenger who sleeps through the beverage service and wakes up irritated and thirsty is bad,"" said Midwest Airlines flight attendant Sandy Wolchek. ""You multiply that by five on a Milwaukee-to-Minneapolis flight, and you're talking about a serious disruption."" Prolonged rest is the only known remedy for Super Lag, according to Bill Ziegler of the Centers For Fatigue Control. ""Victims can also alleviate their symptoms by wadding jackets or sweaters into makeshift pillows,"" he said. ""And we're recommending that airlines loosen their restriction on reclining cabin seats during the ascent and descent phases of flights."" Scientists at the CFC are working around the clock to find a Super Lag cure, but so far, they have made little progress. For now, they recommend that air-travel passengers look out for Super Lag's warning signs: irritability, an unwillingness to engage in small talk with persons in adjoining seats, and a tendency to doze off while reading in-flight magazines."
Calcutta Fire Marshal: Many Indian Homes Lack Bride Extinguisher,8/17/05,716,"CALCUTTA, INDIA—Failure to own or use a bride extinguisher results in millions of rupees of property damage in India annually, Calcutta fire marshal Prasad Chandra said in a press conference Monday. ""This tragedy occurs far too often when well-meaning husbands, attempting to collect on a dowry, ignite their brides indoors. The damage is often compounded when a burning bride attempts to escape and spreads the flames to other homes,"" Chandra said. ""If you absolutely must burn your bride, avoid additional destruction with an affordable bride extinguisher. And, if possible, confine the burning to your backyard bride pit."" He also recommended that homeowners install and periodically test marital smoke detectors."
Red Cross Accused Of Wartime Non-Profiteering,8/03/05,634,"WASHINGTON, DC—The Senate Armed Services Committee issued a rebuke of the International Red Cross Monday, accusing the organization of wartime non-profiteering.

""Whatever their stated mission, the Red Cross exists only to fatten its blood banks and care packages.""

Repressed-Memory Therapist Recovers Rockford Files Episode,6/08/05,5045,"OTTUMWA, IA—After months of hypnotherapy, local repressed-memory therapist Brian Marnard has helped Joan Spees, a 37-year-old farm-equipment sales consultant, recover an entire Rockford Files episode from the darkest reaches of her subconscious mind. ""Joan, who had suffered from seemingly inexplicable anxiety attacks her entire adult life, was the perfect candidate for repressed-memory therapy,"" Marnard said Monday. ""Under my care, she began recovering vivid memory flashes from what seemed to be a single, distinct episode from her past. The images included an old-fashioned answering machine turning on in an empty room, a gold Firebird experiencing a sudden, violent change in direction, and a dark-haired man walking on the beach. In spite of the memory's persistent nature, Joan could not see how the fragments were related."" Spees said that, although the flashbacks would intrude upon her waking hours accompanied by the same ""catchy snippet"" of music, they did little to disrupt her personal life. Nonetheless, Marnard was concerned about what the memories might signify. ""Repressed memories, which are stored outside the awareness of the conscious mind, can usually be traced back to a traumatic event,"" Marnard said. ""What if Joan had been the victim of childhood sexual abuse by the dark-haired man she felt was named James, Jim, Garner, or Rockford? If so, she needed to bring these memories to the fore and confront them."" For two months, Marnard engaged Spees in an exhaustive, expensive course of drug-mediated interviews, hypnosis, regression therapy, and literal dream interpretation. ""Brian said my scraps of recollection were probably part of something bigger, an incident at least 44 minutes long—one that might be part of a larger chain of similar events from my adolescence,"" Spees said. ""Brian kept encouraging me to pursue my vague feeling that the man I was seeing was a criminal, even though I felt even more strongly that the mysterious figure could be trusted."" According to Marnard, Spees' first few sessions progressed little beyond her strong memory of lying on her family's living room floor. ""I'm 8… I'm wearing my Pooh pajamas… wrapped in an olive-green blanket…"" a transcript of Spees' first session read. ""A phone's ringing, but it's not mine… I'm waiting for someone to answer the phone… There's a message…. An important message about someone picking up the car from the garage? No, it's a woman saying she's lonely… no, it's a pizza shop. I'm not sure…"" At that point in the session, Spees would usually whistle a distinctive melody. ""It was a long time before I got any more out of her,"" Marnard said. ""But finally, Joan was able to recover some very strong memories, like the image of a murder suspect who supposedly died in a car accident. And something about an angel trying to get his money back from a swindler who was on the run from the mob. And then, there was a garbage disposal jammed by a missing bullet."" ""Still,"" Marnard added. ""She was never able to fully understand what was going on."" Finally, near the end of a one-hour 'deep therapy' session, Spees had a breakthrough. ""I was about to bring Joan out of it, when she started talking in a deep voice, like that of a father figure,"" Marnard said. ""I could feel we were reaching a climax. That's when she said, 'Honey, we're all scared to death. I guess that's the price we pay for living in a world where we sell cemetery plots on billboards by the freeway and all the prices end in 99 cents. What you gotta do is just keep laughing.'"" Marnard said it wasn't until Spees paused and said, ""Later tonight on NBC…"" that he recognized the quote as coming from Jim Rockford, the laid-back ex-con-turned-detective played by James Garner on the popular '70s TV show, The Rockford Files. In spite of the breakthrough, Dr. Klaus Stenner of the Iowa Psychological Association criticized Marnard's methods, and those of all repressed-memory therapists, calling them unprofessional. ""There is no real evidence that childhood memories are ever unconsciously repressed,"" Stenner said. ""In addition, recovering these supposedly repressed memories, whether of sexual abuse or the plots of popular television series, has never led to significant improvement in a patient's psychological health and stability. Luckily, Spees was spared any lasting harm—probably because her memories were innocuous and generally positive, thanks to The Rockford Files' high production values and taut writing."" Immediately after the breakthrough, Spees discontinued her twice-weekly visits and refused to pay her outstanding bill, calling Marnard ""a quack."" Marnard, however, adamantly insists that Spees should return to therapy. ""Joan can run from her problems all she wants, but the haunting, sinister image of the gun in the cookie jar will be with her forever,"" Marnard said. ""And even if she has discovered the source of the mysterious answering-machine messages, it doesn't explain Joan's recurring memories of a shadowy, mustachioed figure known only as 'Higgins.'"""
Local Man Pushed Well Within Limits Of Human Endurance,5/18/05,626,"DURHAM, NC—In the face of reasonable odds, Louis Collins, 27, endured a challenge Monday that tested, but did not by any means exceed, his ability to persevere. ""The line at the DMV was really long, and I had a lunch meeting at noon,"" said Collins, recounting the inconvenient event that ultimately did no lasting damage. ""Then I realized that I still needed to fill out a form, but I didn't have a pen. If I had left the line to use a pen at the counter, I would have had to start all over. Thank goodness someone in line lent me one."" In spite of the unremarkable series of obstacles, Collins still arrived at lunch on time."
36-Year-Old Still Looking For Ways To Make Brushing Fun,5/11/05,4531,"SAN FRANCISCO—More than three decades after acquiring his first Pink Panther toothbrush, Mark Naasz continues to search unsuccessfully for new ways to make brushing his teeth fun, the 36-year-old Bernal Heights resident revealed Monday. ""Check it out: Tom's Of Maine fennel-flavored all-natural anti-cavity toothpaste,"" said Naasz, pulling the $4.89 item from a Whole Foods bag. ""It says here that fennel is an all-natural, herbal breath-freshener that's been used for centuries. And look: This little snap-lid bottle fits in my jacket pocket, so I'll probably start brushing my teeth after lunch. I've been meaning to get into that habit for years."" Although Naasz's taste in toothpastes, mouthwashes, flosses, brushes, and other oral-hygiene aids has grown more sophisticated over time, his desire to make the chore of dental care enjoyable has remained constant. ""Every time I go to the dentist and get a cleaning, I vow that I'll start taking better care of my teeth,"" said Naasz, who brushes two times a day and flosses once or twice whenever he buys a new flossing product. ""If I could just find something that would make fighting plaque and tartar less of a boring, repetitive chore—like a really flavorful toothpaste or a cool electric toothbrush—then I'd want to do it."" Naasz's pursuit of good dental hygiene extends beyond dentifrices and brushing devices. He recently embarked upon and quickly abandoned a foray into home tooth-whitening. ""I thought whitening my teeth would be fun—really dramatic or something,"" Naasz said. ""But the [whitening] strips felt weird against my teeth, and it was torture keeping them in my mouth for 30 minutes. Really, I don't know what I was thinking—I can't even stand gargling with Listerine for 30 seconds."" Faith Combes, Naasz's girlfriend of three years, has stood by as Naasz cycled through dozens of over-the-counter tooth-cleaning products. According to Combes, Naasz's fascination with new dental products is matched only by his ability to grow bored with them. ""Whenever a weird, nobby toothbrush or a ridiculously complicated toothpaste comes out, Mark buys it,"" Combes said. ""He was really into this 'liquid calcium' Enamelon for a while. Before that, it was Mentadent—you know, the toothpaste with the 'unique dual-chamber pump.' But then he got tired of buying the big, stupid refill cartridges. He went through an extreme toothpaste phase for a while. But lately, since they opened the Whole Foods near his apartment, he's been on an organic, all-natural kick. Hence the fennel stuff, the taste of which I'm guessing he'll hate."" ""I don't know,"" Combes added. ""Somewhere along the line, Mark got it into his head that oral hygiene can somehow be made fun. It's an idea he refuses to let go of."" Naasz's preoccupation with the brushing habit started in 1974, when he received a Pink Panther electric toothbrush on his 6th birthday. Naasz quickly discovered that he didn't like the feeling of motorized bristles on his teeth, began using the Pink Panther toothbrush as a doll, and was well on his way to developing his first cavity. When he reached his teenage years, products like Aquafresh toothpaste—with its alternating red, green, and white stripes—briefly appealed to Naasz, who found a renewed interest in fresh breath and white teeth upon reaching dating age. But according to the 36-year-old, not one product has helped make brushing anything but an unpleasant responsibility. ""All the packages look so great in the pharmacy,"" Naasz said. ""But using the products is never as nice as looking at them on the shelf, when they're all pure and full of promise. Once you put that first dent in the tube, the allure is gone."" Naasz said that reflecting upon his misbegotten dental-care past ""brings him to the brink of despair."" ""Sometimes I'm like, 'What's wrong with me?'"" Naasz said. ""No matter what I buy, I have to force myself to brush, and I come away thinking brushing is an everyday duty that has nothing to do with pleasure."" American Dental Association spokesperson Elizabeth Bagnold said Naasz's case is like many seen by the nation's most prominent dental-health advocacy group. ""For years, the ADA has stated that brushing should be fun,"" Bagnold said. ""But upon reviewing Mr. Naasz's case, we are considering revising our policy. Proper oral hygiene provides plenty of lasting benefits, but it is rarely enjoyable for its own sake. I would go so far as to say that fear, rather than fun, provides a much more legitimate motivation to brush and floss daily."""
Rapidly Swelling Man May Contain Traces Of Peanuts,5/04/05,530,"PENSACOLA, FL—Lance Kiser, the host at the Erewan Thai restaurant, informed fellow employees Monday that the bloated, choking man at table four may contain trace amounts of peanuts. ""Warning: The dark-haired businessman who very suddenly began experiencing shortness of breath, confusion, and slurred speech may contain trace amounts of peanuts,"" Kiser said. ""He definitely ate a plate of chicken curry prepared in the same facility as dishes containing peanuts and/or other nuts."" The purple-faced, swelling man declined comment."

French's Introduces Antibacterial Mustard,4/13/05,3455,"ROCHESTER, NY—In response to increasing American demand for tangier, more hygienic meals, condiment giant French's has introduced a new antibacterial mustard. ""Each year, 15 million cases of bacterial food poisoning originate in U.S. home kitchens, resulting in nausea, diarrhea, fever, and even death,"" read a press release French's issued Monday. ""Now, lunch doesn't have to endanger your health! All-new French's Antibacterial Mustard is the perfect way to add flavor to, and subtract harmful disease-causing bacteria from, your family's favorite meals!"" According to French's representative Darla Nelson, the new hypoallergenic mustard complements the company's expanding line—which includes French's Honey Dijon Mustard and French's Sweet & Tangy Honey Mustard—and kills over 99.99% of harmful germs. The mustard is orange in color, more translucent than the traditional varieties, and somewhat medicinal in flavor. In product trials performed by French's, mothers preferred antibacterial mustard five to one when informed of its sterilizing properties. A television commercial for the mustard plays up its prominent role in luncheon sanitization. ""Approximately 9,000 deaths per year are attributed to foodborne pathogens, and the most germ-filled location in the house is the kitchen,"" a woman says as computer-generated footage zooms in to show worm-like spirochete bacteria multiplying on a slice of bologna. ""Normal mustards do nothing to combat the germs that begin forming on meats and cheeses as soon as they're taken out of the refrigerator. But an hour after spreading on our powerful French's Antibacterial Mustard, your lunch is still free of everything but zesty mustard taste!"" Nelson said consumers are increasingly concerned with the lack of germicidal properties in old-fashioned, non-antibacterial condiments. ""When I used to spread old-style mustard on my children's hot dogs, I never knew what sort of bugs were breeding between the buns,"" said a woman quoted on French's website. ""For all I know, microorganisms were actually feeding off the condiments I was squirting on my family's meat. But now that I use French's Antibacterial, I'm reassured by the mustard's bright orange sheen, unique tanginess, and the little foaming bubbles that show it's working. That's a mustard we all can live with."" Not everyone is in favor of the new product. Lloyd Cummings, a toppings expert at the Institute for Public Health, said French's Antibacterial poses more health and taste hazards than it solves. ""We're going to see many American sandwich-makers using these powerful mustards, because the condiments have been marketed as an effective way to lower the risk of infection,"" Cummings said. ""But widespread antibacterial sandwich-spread use will likely result in the formation of a strain of ham- and cheese-originated, drug-resistant bacteria. These 'superlunchbugs' will be more deadly than any bacteria we see today. For lunches prepared or packed for healthy family members, regular household mustard is strong enough. And it tastes a lot less like iodine."" In spite of such warnings, Nelson said all French's mustards will eventually contain triclosan, the most trusted antibacterial agent used in hospitals today, and that the company is currently working on three new germ-fighting sauces: Cattlemen's Kansas City Antibiotic BBQ Sauce, Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce with Hydrogen Peroxide, and French's Worcestershire-Neosporin Sauce."
Terri Schiavo Dies Of Embarrassment,4/06/05,833,"PINELLAS PARK, FL—Terri Schiavo, the shy woman whose self-image issues put her in a 15-year coma, died of embarrassment Thursday, the eyes of the entire world fixed upon her. ""Terri, who had been extremely reserved before her debilitation, found herself trapped at the center of an epic legal battle that became the focus of the nation,"" said Dr. Kyle Williamson, who treated Schiavo several years ago. ""The involvement of President Bush, Congress, and numerous church officials further complicated what might have been a simple right-to-die case, and made Terri's weight issues and family difficulties public knowledge. She finally succumbed to the embarrassment last week, at age 41."" Specifics of Schiavo's dying breath and photos of the woman in her self-conscious 20s have been appearing in newspapers worldwide since her death."

Anti-Chewing-Tobacco Activists Speak Out Against Secondhand Spit,3/30/05,3710,"RALEIGH, NC—The ever-embattled tobacco industry suffered another blow Monday, as citizens' groups challenged the major smokeless-tobacco companies to confront the quality-of-life issues associated with secondhand spit. ""This isn't the '50s, when you would see TV commercials with lab-coat-wearing doctors spitting chewing tobacco right on the examination-room floor,"" said activist Helen Pertwee of The Great American Tobacco Backwash, a citizens' group dedicated to fighting the rising tide of secondhand tobacco spit in public places. ""In this day and age, we are much more informed about the consequences of secondhand spit, and non-chewers are refusing to expose ourselves to it."" New York resident Glen Abramson objects to the use of chewing tobacco in public places. ""I can't go to a bar without coming home reeking of tobacco spit,"" Abramson said. ""I have to wring my clothes out in the sink before I go to bed. Sometimes, I'll get them back from the dry-cleaners with flakes of chew still clinging in the weave."" Boston's Janice MacGruder frequently eats out at a restaurant that allows smokeless tobacco. ""The spit affects the taste of the food,"" MacGruder said. ""The hazy, brown mist hanging in the air doesn't stay in the chewing section—common sense can tell you that. Despite the image the old phrase conjures up, it's not romantic to eat a meal in a 'spit-filled room.'"" The pools of tobacco spit on floors and tables are particularly noisome to people in the service industry, who are exposed to three times more secondhand spit than the average American—up to 450 gallons a year. ""The way people view secondhand spit needs to change,"" said Lindsey Hurness, a bartender in Tampa, FL. ""People spit their gobs of old chew everywhere—in drink glasses, in plants, in the sink. And the floors are slick with pools of spit. Sometimes, on busy weekend nights, the goopy brown stuff comes up to my shoelaces."" Secondhand-spit exposure is not a problem experienced only by bar and restaurant patrons. ""Ask any frequent traveler: It's hell to be on a plane if the other passengers are chewing tobacco,"" said business consultant Jessica Mallard, who is on the road 250 days a year. ""Even when I get a window seat, I walk off the plane with half of my blazer absolutely drenched in the stuff."" ""Then there's the hotel,"" Mallard added. ""Even if you stay in a no-chewing room, you get a spit-sodden pillow half the time. And if they don't have any no-chewing rooms left, you might as well go sleep in the rodeo bleachers."" According to hotel managers, spit-related costs are rising. ""There was a time, 10 or 15 years ago, when hotels could get along with one wet-vac,"" said Red Roof Inn vice president Ronald Henneman, who oversees housekeeping for the national chain. ""No more. We extracted enough tobacco-saliva slurry from our carpets last year to float the Queen Mary."" Although the smokeless-tobacco industry says there is no hard evidence of any health risk associated with exposure to secondhand spit, their claim is questioned by an increasingly moist and nauseated public. ""I don't give a shit what Skoal says, secondhand spit is a serious threat,"" Pertwee said. ""At the very least, the industry needs to measure secondhand spit's effects on kids, who are closer to the ground, where all that spit ends up."" As long as tobacco chewers continue to exert their influence in Congress, people like Pertwee will be swimming upstream. ""I don't know why everyone's got their panties in a twist about this,"" said Ron Preston, ejecting a stream of brown saliva into a nearby plant. ""It's my body—unless those PC Nazis get their way. If people don't like getting spit on, they can move over. It's that simple."""

""Just getting in here and signing up is enough for today. I think I'll reward myself with a smoothie."" Scarbe will return to Bally's twice in April, then once in May to use the whirlpool, and ultimately cancel his membership in 2007, when he notices Bally listed on his credit-card statement."
"Despite Bad Press, Calorie Industry Projects Record-Breaking Year",3/16/05,3221,"HOUSTON—In spite of seemingly endless criticism, representatives for the U.S. calorie industry predicted another record-breaking year in 2005, the American Calorie Council announced Monday. ""Magazines, fitness gurus, TV-news anchors—they're always attacking calories and telling Americans to eat less of them,"" said ACC spokesman Nathan Sorenson. ""Well, after many years, we're getting used to bad press. Regardless of what people say, the calorie industry continues to be a major growth industry."" Sorenson said all sectors of the calorie industry—which includes producers of meat, dairy, produce, fish, bread, candy, alcoholic beverages, and some soft drinks—have made optimistic projections for 2005. ""No matter how much the media derides us, consumers keep coming back for more calories,"" Sorenson said. ""They can't live without 'em."" Although calorie-industry officials have been hesitant to release actual numbers, Sorenson said there will be ""major consumption"" in 2005. ""In 2004, we moved trillions of calories every month, which is exactly what one would expect in a depressed economy,"" Sorenson said. ""If our projections are accurate, we'll be adding another couple trillion to our monthly figures."" Sorenson said there has been an across-the-board increase in caloric consumption, with a marked increase in empty calories. ""Every field has been doing well, but the empty-calorie division is going through the roof,"" Sorenson said. ""Anyone working in high-fructose corn syrup should be proud."" Sorenson acknowledged that, like any industry, the calorie industry goes in cycles. ""Summer is our toughest season, since people tend to eat lightly in the heat,"" Sorenson said. ""Fortunately, we more than make up for it in November. Thanksgiving is like Christmas for us. Christmas isn't too bad, either."" Sorenson said that the calorie industry ""took some hits"" in the '90s. ""When the surgeon general recommended drinking eight glasses of water a day, that was a dark time for us,"" Sorenson said. ""Drinking water makes people feel full. We're still feeling the effects today."" Calorie-industry pundits said the record-breaking projections are not just pie-in-the-sky optimism. ""Calories is one of the strongest, most reliable growth industries, right up there with real estate and munitions,"" said Victor Polser, managing editor of Caloric Insider magazine. ""When one section of the calorie industry starts lagging, such as bread or pasta, another section, like beef or cheese, picks up the slack. If you ask me, it'd be impossible for this industry to take a crippling hit without a lot of Americans dying."" Despite the patina of invulnerability, the ACC is not content to rest on its laurels. Last week, they rolled out a nationwide cross-media campaign. Within the next month, the ACC will unveil ads featuring the slogans ""Calories: It's What's For Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, And Between-Meal Snacks,"" and ""Have You Had Your 2,000 Today?"" ""We don't need to increase our profits, but we want to show consumers that the calorie industry isn't the monster the press has made it out to be,"" Sorenson said. ""Calorie consumption is a part of every American's daily life, sometimes as many as eight or nine times a day."""

Nation's Leading Alarmists Excited About Bird Flu,2/02/05,4151,"WASHINGTON, DC—The avian influenza virus, a mutant flu strain that has claimed the lives of 31 people in Eastern Asia since it was first observed passing from birds to humans in 1997, has the nation's foremost alarmists extremely agitated. ""Right now, the bird flu is just a blip in the newspapers, but if the avian influenza virus undergoes antigenic shift with a human influenza virus, the resulting subtype could be highly contagious and highly lethal in humans,"" Matthew Wexler, the president of the National Alarmist Council and one of the nation's leading fear mongers, said Monday. ""My professional opinion, and more importantly, my personal belief, is that this is a cause for great national alarm."" Wexler's sentiments were unanimously upheld by members of the alarmist community. ""The bird flu could cause a global influenza pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu that killed more than 20 million people in 1918,"" medical alarmist Dr. Preston Douglas said. ""Many experts also believe a major global flu outbreak to be imminent, if not—God forbid—already underway. Why, recent observation and documentation has recorded at least one case of human-to-human transmission of a rare strain of the avian influenza virus. If this one case is proof that the animal virus is mutating into a contagious, lethal human virus, then the entire world is basically doomed. Doomed!"" Douglas is best known for his brilliant alarmist analyses of flesh-eating bacteria, Ebola, and SARS—all of which he successfully developed into topics of major international trepidation. Bird flu was first identified as a strain of infectious influenza in Italy in the early 1900s. Of the 15 subtypes, only subtypes H5 and H7 are known to be capable of crossing the species barrier from birds to humans. The first human outbreak, which occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, killed four people. Since then, the bird flu has remained a relatively minor virus, killing fewer individuals than common-cold variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued neither an epidemic warning nor a public-health alert in connection with bird flu. According to leading alarmists, the CDC's lack of immediate concern is a cause for alarm. ""So, basically, the CDC doesn't have the first inkling of what to do about a potentially explosive form of flu that infects ducks and chickens,"" said Fox News Science, Health, and Epidemics Commentator Marylinne Kent. ""Given the popularity of these two birds as a food source among Asians, and the fact that we have no idea how many undocumented Asians have settled illegally in our nation, the potential for danger is extremely high."" ""I urge you all to think of your families,"" Kent added. Harold Jefferson, a founding member of the American National Citizen's Institute for Alarm, read from a prepared statement Tuesday. ""We have to face the facts: This isn't just a rapacious killer that could be incubating anywhere within our borders and for which there is no known cure,"" Jefferson said. ""It is also an indicator of the profound indifference of millions of American citizens. Mark my words: People who aren't scared now will look pretty stupid if it turns out that they should have been."" Jefferson added: ""The bird flu could someday claim as many lives as Mad Cow Disease."" Ruth Herrin, the New York Post's veteran panic expert, has relied heavily on information provided by alarmists in the scientific community. ""Listen, I'm no disease expert,"" Herrin said. ""But I know that people should be warned about global devastation any time a devastation scenario can be extrapolated from an actual news report. And for the 16th consecutive month, that time is now."" None of the nation's 15,000 certified alarmists have offered a strategy to deal with a possible outbreak. ""Listen, finding cures is not my job,"" Wexler said. ""I just report the facts as best and as briefly as I can. Then I interpret them in what I, as an alarmist, believe to be the most effective fashion. And if what I perceive here is real—namely, a looming epidemic and an atmosphere of apathy and fatalism in the U. S. medical community—then we are facing Armageddon."""
Sex Life Embellished During Doctor Visit,2/02/05,455,"DURANT, OK—During a routine physical Tuesday, Jason Gunder, 21, exaggerated his sexual exploits for the benefit of his physician, Dr. Stanley Pindel. ""Unprotected intercourse? Sure, I have it all the time,"" Gunder said. ""Partners? Thirty or something. I've had so many, I can't even remember."" After nodding thoughtfully, Dr. Pindel told Gunder, ""If you do actually ever have sex, please make sure to use a condom and a water-based spermicidal lubricant."""

""Mr. Patterson, I'm so sorry to tell you this, but you have—you're not going to believe it—spinocerebellar ataxia!"" Stellbrach said, waving an x-ray of Patterson's spinal cord.

HMO Targets Blacks With 'Rapping Good' Health Campaign,1/12/05,702,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN—Advertising executives say they have hit upon an ingenious new way to target blacks: Mount a campaign that co-opts their own language and musical style. ""Many blacks enjoy 'rapping' music,"" said Briggs & Adams Advertising president Sherman Roe, who developed the campaign for HospCare HMO. ""And what better way to tap into their market than by 'rapping' good health to them?"" Roe's campaign employs the use of a black teenager doing a ""rap"" for good health. Billboards of the campaign have been put up in black neighborhoods, and radio and TV ads have aired on black-oriented stations in the area. Roe predicts area blacks will, as a result, be ""'rapping' happy with their HMO service."""
"Obesity, Obesity Reports On The Rise",1/05/05,1565,"ALBANY, NY (Nov. 14)—Americans have never been more aware of the dangers of weight gain, nor have they ever weighed so much, according to a SUNY-Binghamton study released Monday. ""In 1989, Americans were exposed to 1.8 reports on obesity each week and were an average of five pounds overweight,"" study director Marilyn Fleder said. ""Today, the average American is nearly 10 pounds overweight and sees or reads at least four reports on the obesity epidemic each week. If the trend continues unchecked, Americans will weigh 17 pounds more, and network news shows will devote a daily minimum of three minutes of airtime to obesity issues by 2010."" Fleder blamed the dual trend on Americans' increasingly sedentary lifestyles. ""Americans get their news about obesity by watching television or reading magazines and newspapers, which force the reader or viewer to assume a physically passive position,"" Fleder said. ""This contributes to weight gain, which is then dutifully reported by the media. It's a vicious cycle."" Fleder said the trend could reverse itself if Americans had healthier diets and became more physically active. ""While reports have ballooned to hundreds of pages in length, there is hope,"" Fleder said. ""If Americans improve their eating and exercise habits, obesity reports could quickly begin to drop in size, shedding as many as 20 to 30 pages a year, until they disappear altogether."" Fleder added that the media could also play a useful role by limiting obesity coverage to the later prime-time hours between 9 and 11 p.m., after the dinner hour."
Threat Of Catching Olympic Fever At All-Time Low,1/05/05,1112,"COLORADO SPRINGS, CO (June 13)—U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Jim Scherr announced Thursday that the risk of contracting Olympic Fever, the virulent international strain of athletic obsession that sweeps the nation every four years, has dropped to a historic low. ""The once-infectious strain is no longer considered contagious,"" Scherr said. ""This is largely because of a years-long immunization campaign in which Americans were exposed to related strains, such as NFL Fever, March Madness, and the NASCAR Immunodeficiency Virus. As a result, most American sports fans have built up powerful immunities. Just look at the once-menacing NHL Pandemic, which has been completely eradicated as of this year."" According to Scherr, even children under the age of 12, a group once extremely susceptible to the fever, have been largely unaffected in recent years. Scherr warned that Olympic Fever, which still affects hundreds of thousands in developing nations, could re-emerge in America if New York City carries out its plan to build a sports complex on the disease-infested shores of the Hudson River by 2012."

Psychiatrists Treating Phantom Of The Opera Viewers For Post-Melodramatic Stress Disorder,12/22/04,4303,"HOLLYWOOD—Psychiatrists in select cities nationwide have reported a surge in Post-Melodramatic Stress Disorder cases following the Dec. 22 release of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom Of The Opera. ""We're seeing a barrage of psychological consequences in those who have been exposed to the violently overblown acting and protracted, heightened emotions in The Phantom Of The Opera,"" said Bill Lambert, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago. ""After such intense abuse of their artistic sensibilities, melodrama victims are finding themselves plagued by extreme sentimentality, flashbacks to especially torturous scenes, and canned-emotional detachment."" According to Lambert, a good portion of PMSD sufferers are experiencing distress so great that it is interfering with their jobs as overweight receptionists, struggling fashion designers, and community-theater actors. ""PMSD sufferers walk through their days with the specter of an unnecessary musical number hanging over them like a mask,"" Lambert said. ""The prelude is constantly playing in their unconscious minds, threatening to crescendo into exaggerated, choreographed action at any moment. Anything can set them off: a chandelier, a strain of saccharine music, a gaudy outfit."" According to Lambert, PMSD victims are vulnerable to further emotional manipulation. ""Those who have witnessed Phantom often tend to leave themselves open to additional emotional battery, whether in the form of another vapid musical or a book of heartwarming anecdotes,"" Lambert said. ""Programs that appear contrived to healthy people appear heartbreakingly sad to PMSD sufferers. They sometimes sit and stare at the Hallmark Channel for hours on end."" Lambert urged loved ones to watch possible PMSD sufferers closely and seek professional help if necessary. ""It's impossible to know what your friends and loved ones are going through if you haven't witnessed the rapidly vacillating extremes of Phantom,"" said Dr. Harris Jones, a prominent New York psychiatrist who specializes in entertainment-related disorders. ""Offer your support, but do not claim to understand the levels of treacle a PMSD sufferer has survived."" Post-melodramatic stress disorder was first identified in 1949, following the debut of the World War II-themed South Pacific. Though anecdotal evidence of PMSD mounted for the next four decades, the affliction was not studied at length until researchers at Cornell performed a systematic analysis of theatergoers returning from the 1989 opening of the Vietnam-era musical Miss Saigon. In recent years, researchers have found that PMSD can result from any number of near-tragic dramas, be they live musical theater or televised soap opera. They found PMSD especially dangerous among individuals already suffering from disbelief suspension, aesthetic vacuity, or general mental insufficiency. While PMSD isn't a new phenomenon, the magnitude of the current outbreak is unprecedented. ""This outbreak rivals the Broadway Phantom epidemic of 1988,"" said Dr. David Sussman, a psychiatrist at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. ""Many victims choose to relive the horrifying play season after season."" ""And even if they don't see the play several times, the unfortunate fact is that those who have seen Phantom never forget their first time,"" Sussman added. Boston resident Leo Wilson was forced by his girlfriend to see a preview of the film version of Phantom. ""I was led down a dark hallway. I found myself in a large room filled with rows of chairs all facing in the same direction,"" Wilson said. ""I sat down, and I was subjected to a series of horrendously overwrought images. I was powerless to stop them. I cried out, but I was silenced by those around me and forced to watch for what seemed like hours."" After several days spent with the song ""Think Of Me"" playing over and over again in his head, Wilson sought psychiatric treatment. ""I don't blame any one aspect of the melodrama—the shallow characters, the unbelievable swings in emotion, the repellent score,"" Wilson said. ""But I can't help regretting that there was no absolutely redeeming value to this atrocity. We all suffered for nothing. It's hard to come to terms with the fact that a human being would perpetrate three such unconscionable acts upon another human."""
Man Gets All The Way To Hospital Just To Find Out Wife Will Be Fine,12/01/04,600,"BRIDGEPORT, CT—Responding to a distressing message left on his voicemail, Martin Hermenson drove all the way across town to Bridgeport Hospital Saturday, only to learn that his wife Kara will be fine. ""All I heard was 'Kara fell off a ladder,' so I left work and rushed right to the emergency room,"" Hermenson said. ""I got there, and it turned out she'd fractured her fibula—no big deal at all. It wasn't like she was never going to walk again."" Hermenson added that he didn't see why he had to waste perfectly good Knicks tickets that night, when Kara went straight to bed after getting home anyway."
Workout Routine Broken Down For Coworker,11/03/04,4158,"SAN JOSE, CA—Heritage Ink Supply sales representative Eric Vanderbilt broke his workout routine down in the company breakroom Monday, for the benefit of coworker Jennifer Kim. ""Mondays, I focus on chest and triceps,"" Vanderbilt told Kim, after she said that her 232-pound coworker ""must go to a gym or something."" ""I usually start with the flat bench press, which works the whole chest. Then, I move on to the incline and decline bench press—those focus on the upper and lower chest, respectively. Sometimes, I do dumbbells, just to mix it up. For the triceps, I usually do french press and dips."" Kim said that, in asking Vanderbilt whether he belonged to a gym, she had neither sought nor expected a meticulous account of his lifting regimen. ""It's all about DPP: discipline, persistence, and patience,"" Vanderbilt said, watching the muscles in his forearm move as he worked his wrist back and forth. ""I do six or eight reps for each exercise, unless I'm increasing the weight. In that case, I decrease the reps. No cheat reps. No 'one rep max.' A lot of the younger guys are doing 'one rep max' for quick gain, but they're playing with fire."" Many common perceptions about weightlifting are incorrect, Vanderbilt told Kim as she removed a plate from the microwave and stared in the direction of her cubicle. ""You might think you gotta do chest and arms every day of the week, but you don't,"" Vanderbilt said. ""It's actually important to let your muscles recover. That's why I do legs on Tuesday, back and biceps on Thursday, and shoulders on Friday. I take Wednesdays and weekends off. I don't just sit around eating chips and watching TV, though. I usually go for a swim. Gotta keep up the old cardiovascular."" Added Vanderbilt: ""What I'm striving for is a total body workout."" He then stressed the importance of stretching before strenuous exercise. ""Even if I don't do any serious exercise, I'll do 20 minutes of stretching,"" Vanderbilt said. ""That's a bare minimum. If I'm lifting, then I stretch out before and after the workout. You wouldn't believe how many injuries could be avoided if people stretched before they worked out. If I have time, I like to stretch the muscles I'm working out between reps. You look pretty flexible. Do you do yoga?"" Kim responded by smiling and reaching for a AAA-member magazine sitting on the table. ""You don't eat French fries, do you?"" Vanderbilt said, eyeing Kim's organic burrito. ""Those are the worst things for your body. You might as well be eating lard. Seriously, if you don't put the right things into your body, you're not going to get the maximum benefit from all that sweat. I usually eat a chicken sandwich without the bun about two hours before a workout and then maybe a can of tuna mixed with vegetables 20 minutes after I'm done. To build muscle, you need protein—lots of it."" Vanderbilt said that, in order to add mass, he stacks his supplements, starting his day with a high-protein shake, an antioxidant multivitamin, a cardio-support supplement, a selenium supplement, and steel-cut oats sprinkled with whey. When Kim asked Vanderbilt why he spends so much time at the gym, instead of spending it with friends or a girlfriend, Vanderbilt said it was important to take care of his most valuable asset: his body. ""I like knowing my body is working at peak efficiency,"" Vanderbilt said. ""When I walk out of the gym, I feel physically and mentally disciplined. I like that. And there's a group down at the gym. We like to hang out at the juice bar and talk about routines, diet, and where to buy gear and workout clothes."" After stressing the importance of drinking enough water every day, Vanderbilt excused himself to take a phone call at his desk, giving Kim the opportunity to return to her cubicle and reflect on what she had learned about her coworker. ""Well, I learned that that Eric guy likes to work out—a lot,"" Kim said. ""I also know that he likes to eat five or six meals a day instead of three. I think I offended him, though, when I asked him about steroids. It's amazing I managed that, since I barely got three words in edgewise for the last 15 minutes. Oh, and now my food's cold."""
Flu Vaccine Shortage,10/27/04,117,What are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending in response to the current flu vaccine shortage?
Kerry: Stem-Cell Research May Hold Cure To Ailing Campaign,10/20/04,4000,"ROCHESTER, MN—In a major policy address at the Mayo Clinic Tuesday, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry drew a sharp distinction between himself and President Bush by championing unfettered scientific exploration of embryonic stem cells, which experts say could hold the cure to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Kerry's ailing campaign. ""The possibilities are limitless, both for science and my campaign,"" said Kerry, who enjoyed a bump in the polls after the debates but is still struggling to secure a lead over Bush. ""If adequately funded, stem-cell researchers might find cures for hundreds of diseases, from diabetes to cancer. And, if the nation would focus on my opponent's ideological extremism, I might get elected."" In 2001, the Bush administration placed limits on federal funding for stem-cell research. This move was applauded by many religious conservatives, who oppose stem-cell research because it requires the harvesting of stem-cell lines from human embryos. ""For too long, President Bush has curtailed science on ideological grounds, for his own political purposes,"" Kerry said. ""I pledge to support science on rational grounds, for my own political purposes. Stem-cell research could improve the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans, and the issue could dramatically increase my popularity. We must push the boundaries of scientific exploration now, before Nov. 2."" ""My opponent has put the interests of a vocal minority over the needs of me, my campaign staff, and John Edwards,"" Kerry added. ""That is just wrong."" According to Democratic strategist Stanley Greenberg, stem-cell research is not universally opposed by Republicans. In fact, many opponents of abortion support stem-cell research. Greenberg said careful research into the voting patterns of moderates and swing voters may provide the ""golden key"" to using the stem-cell issue to advance Kerry's campaign. ""Studies show that nearly 80 percent of voters support stem-cell research,"" Greenberg said. ""A full 206 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 58 members of the Senate have urged Bush to lift federal funding restrictions on stem-cell lines. Kerry's campaign managers can't ignore this potentially campaign-changing data."" Greenberg said stem-cell research could hold tremendous promise for other politicians, as well. ""Stem-cell research might unlock cures for many of the afflictions that face hundreds of Democratic political candidates, right down to the state level,"" Greenberg said. ""That is, if they were lucky enough to find the right campaign ad."" Ravi Dubad, a professor of political science at Rutgers, said that, in spite of the ""enormous potential"" of stem-cell research, the media have yet to adequately explore it. ""The issue received only limited attention during the Democratic Convention in July—when Ronald Reagan Jr. spoke out in its favor—and again, with the recent death of Christopher Reeve,"" Dubad said. ""But I believe the area of stem-cell research could provide thousands, if not millions, of sound bites. It's important for Kerry to raise these issues in debates and stump speeches. But, in order to really make a difference, people outside of the scientific and political communities must get involved, as well."" Democratic vice-presidential nominee John Edwards, however, said candidates should focus on those who are suffering most. ""Scientific exploration in this field holds immense promise for the millions of Americans who are afflicted with genetic diseases or are members of the Democratic party,"" Edwards said. ""Stem-cell research may be the last, best hope for those suffering under diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and the Bush administration."" Continued Edwards: ""Senator Kerry and I pledge to support stem-cell research as a part of our plan to put America on the path to scientific excellence. And, as a part of our plan to win this election, we will begin to talk more often, and more succinctly, about how we pledge to support stem-cell research."""
Intervention Wrapped Up Before Kickoff,9/22/04,4219,"ST. LOUIS—Friends of 33-year-old Drew Sorenson characterized a Sunday alcohol-abuse intervention as a success, reporting that they'd maintained a supportive but firm tone throughout the talk, which they were able to wrap up in time to watch the 12 p.m. Rams-Falcons game. ""It was important that we establish certain things with Drew,"" said Chris Gowan, who first noticed that Sorenson's drinking had become a problem during Wild Card week last season. ""We wanted him to know that we are his friends and we love him, but we won't stand by and watch him destroy his life. And we wanted to get all that said before kickoff, so we could relax and enjoy the game."" It was Gowan, Sorenson's friend since college, who persuaded the support group to meet at his apartment and confront Sorenson. Gowan acknowledged that it was difficult to draw people to his home, because the group usually meets at Sorenson's house to watch Rams games. ""We usually go to Drew's house, but Chris said it was a bad place to talk to Drew about his drinking, 'cause he could just kick everyone out if he got mad,"" Sorenson's brother-in-law Cory Pitts said. ""Chris said we needed a non-threatening, familiar environment. So we all had to come to Chris' place, even though his television is about half the size of Drew's and he only has one couch."" Pitts picked Sorenson up early to ensure that he would be on time, and that he would have no chance to drink before the intervention. ""I suggested that maybe we should pick Drew up a little later, so he'd have enough time to make his onion dip, but Chris said we had to be strong,"" Pitts said. ""At first, I argued, but then Chris pointed out that we didn't have any time to waste if we were going to confront Drew, give him time to open up to us, and work out a tenable plan for his recovery before the coin toss."" ""So I bought some dip,"" Pitts added. The element of surprise is an important part of a well-executed intervention, so Gowan was sure to have the whole group assembled when Sorenson arrived. ""We wanted everything to seem routine,"" said Hugh Baker, Sorenson's coworker and immediate supervisor. ""We had our jerseys on, and everyone was just hanging out having a few and watching the ESPN pre-game. We got kinda edgy waiting for them to show up. We were like, 'We really don't want this talk hanging over our heads while we're watching the Rams kick ass."" As soon as he entered Gowan's apartment, Sorenson asked for a beer. ""I turned to Drew and said, 'Hey, man, we all want to talk to you about your drinking problem, so I'm going to turn the pre-game off here for a bit,'"" Gowan said. ""Drew was like, 'No way! What are you talking about?' It was hard, but I knew we had to do it—or at least turn off the sound."" With the sound muted on the pre-game coverage, Sorenson's friends and loved ones came forward one by one and said they believed drinking was ruining Sorenson's life and their relationships with him. ""We all took turns, trying our best to be firm, honest, and pretty quick about it,"" Gowan said. ""And we were careful not to obstruct the screen."" There were reportedly a few tense moments during the intervention, such as when Baker threatened to fire Sorenson if he continued to drink on the job, and when Sorenson insisted the group's claims were ""bullshit,"" adding that he was going to walk right into the kitchen and get a beer at the next commercial. ""At one point, Drew accused Chris of abusing painkillers and said I cheated in last year's Super Bowl pool,"" Baker said. ""It got really tense. Everyone realized kickoff was only 25 minutes away and there was no resolution in sight."" Friends said they were relieved when, five minutes before kickoff, Sorenson's guard dropped, and he admitted that he'd tried but failed to stop drinking several times during the past year. He agreed to seek treatment. ""I have the greatest friends in the world,"" Sorenson said. ""I guess it's tough love, saying things like that to a guy right before the big game against Atlanta and [quarterback] Michael Vick, but I really needed help. And I'm getting it, too—the guys made me call and sign up at this facility called the Lakeside Center immediately. Well, right after the game, I mean."""
"Son, We'd All Like To Lie Around All Day Being 'Clinically Depressed'",9/01/04,5130,"Justin? Justin, can you hear me through this door? Are you asleep again? Your mom said you got up to use the bathroom a minute ago. She was hoping you were coming down to have dinner with us. No? Hello? Well, son, I know that you have a real problem; at least, that's what the therapist tells us. Anyway, you're not alone. We all get a little low sometimes. Life is certainly no picnic—don't I know it! But usually, after a while, folks snap out of their funks. Not because they want to, but because they come around to the fact that they have no choice. The truth is, son, we'd all like to lie around all day being ""clinically depressed,"" but at some point, we have to swallow hard and face the music. Step up to the ol' plate. There are plenty of mornings I don't want to get up and go to work, but I do. And you know how much your mother hates that exercise bike of hers. Do you see what I'm driving at, son? Justin, your mom and I love you, and we want you to get well. If you have something, anything, you need to get off your chest, please know that you can share it with us. There's no reason to keep it bottled up. Anything you tell that therapist of yours—what's her name, Dr. Goldbar? Goldbrick? Gold—well, anything you tell her, you can tell us, too. I never did see why you'd rather open up to a complete stranger than to the two people who spent years trying to raise you the best way they knew how, but I'm willing to accept it. Just as I accept that you have a problem that you can't control, even though there might be a solution that's as plain as the nose on your face. I guess what I'm saying, Justin, is: I'm a practical person. I always seek the most direct solution to a problem. That may not be intellectual enough for some people, but it's always worked for me. Now, come on down to dinner, Justin. Your mom made pork chops. Son? Justin, do you know what could make you feel better right off the bat? Raising your blinds and letting in some light. Because, I mean, I can believe you feel clinically depressed in that room of yours—I would, too! Anyone would. It's dark, it smells, and there's mounds of clothes and books all over the floor. Get out of bed, open the window, and do a little picking up. Accomplishing a small task could do a lot to restore your self-confidence. Speaking of windows, maybe once you get your room clean, you can help your ol' dad put up the screens. It'd be just like way back when! With all the trouble you've had lately, and the running back and forth to the clinic and to your school, I've fallen behind on household chores. You see, I don't have the luxury of spending Saturday staring at the television, all curled up in a blanket even though it's the middle of summer. There's things that need to be done. I've also had to miss a lot of work. Now, don't worry, your dad is sitting pretty at good old Kenyon Mortgage, but I've caught a little flak from George. Well, it's not fair of him to imply that clinical depression isn't as bad as a real disease. I didn't say this to him, but it's what I believe. Okay? Don't you worry about George one bit. By the way, did you know that those ambulance fees weren't covered by the company health plan? I got the damned co-pay bill yesterday. I yelled my head off at them over the phone, that's for sure, but the girl said there's nothing they can do. Whew, and those pills you take aren't cheap, either, are they? I figured it out, and they come to about $3 apiece! So, uh, when are they going to take effect? You've been on them for a couple months. Son? Look, I think your grandmother had some of this clinical depression herself. I think a lot of it stemmed from her poor upbringing—she never did learn to read or write well. So, you know, her clinical depression wasn't because she was some bored child of privilege. No, she didn't have the luxury of sitting around being clinically depressed. When she got the blues, she sucked it up and carried on, because she knew that life was full of pain—not to mention that she couldn't afford some… shrink. Now, son, you've had more advantages in your 17 years than Mom had in all her 58, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway on your problem. Hell, I'm even willing to call it a problem, instead of calling it ""lying around and feeling sorry for yourself,"" which is sure what it looks like. You can't claim I'm the ogre here. But that's what you think I am, right? A real jerk. ""Fuck you, Butterfat,"" you once told me. Even though I was only trying to help. Butterfat? At least I don't lounge around in my room all day, wasting away to nothing when there's a decent meal right— Justin, open this door right now, dammit! Okay, well now, finally we're getting somewhere. Great to see you at last, son. Look, I'm sorry about being a little tough on you. I suppose ol' Doc Goldwhatever wouldn't be happy. But sometimes, when someone you love is clearly wasting his potential, you have to—hey, where are you going? To the bathroom, again? Justin, why did you lock the door? Oh, dandy. Just dandy. Son, this is hardly what anyone would call a positive step. Justin? Justin, answer me!"
Salad Rendered Unhealthy In Three Steps,8/25/04,562,"PINE BLUFF, AR—A nutritious meal was rendered unhealthy in three easy steps Monday, when area resident Kimberly Lowen, 24, added ranch dressing, grated cheese, and four crumbled strips of bacon to a bowl of romaine lettuce and tomatoes. ""Who says not eating right has to take a lot of time?"" Lowen said. ""It only took minutes to prepare a salad that will provide me with my daily recommended intake of fat and sodium."" Lowen has previously rendered a glass of skim milk unhealthy, simply by adding ice cubes and chocolate syrup and mixing it in a blender on low."
73 Percent Of U.S. Livestock Show Signs Of Clinical Depression,7/21/04,3661,"WASHINGTON, DC—According to a joint study conducted by the FDA and the Department of Agriculture, nearly three out of four members of the U.S. livestock population show signs of clinical depression, with the vast majority of cases going untreated, government officials said Monday. ""The FDA is charged with the task of preventing potentially disastrous outbreaks of disease within the U.S. livestock population,"" said Henry Wolcott, Assistant Undersecretary of Agriculture, Psychiatric Division. ""I'm afraid that, in this case, our intervention came too late. Our study shows that 73 percent of U.S. cattle, goats, sheep, and swine suffer from serious psychiatric problems."" Signs of clinical depression discovered by the researchers include severe listlessness, lack of motivation, and a flattening of emotional affect marked by glazed eyes and slow movements. ""Everyone is concerned about mad cow disease or the bird flu,"" Wolcott said. ""What the average person fails to appreciate, however, is that mental disorders can be just as debilitating as physical ones. If you look into these animals' eyes, you can see the blank gaze of hopelessness and despair."" ""It's tragic,"" Walcott added. ""It's no kind of life, not for man or beast."" Walcott said that millions of animals across the nation while away the hours unproductively, not moving until forced to do so by an outside factor, such as a farmhand or a milking machine. ""Most of the cows we examined barely had the energy to drag themselves from the barn out to the field,"" Walcott said. ""Once in the field, they tended to spend most of their time quietly brooding and chewing cud, showing little to no willingness to communicate with their herd-member peers. Their depression was so debilitating that they needed to be coaxed out of inactivity through the use of hollering, physical force, and, in extreme cases, trained dogs."" The study also noted the average U.S. cow's tendency to emit low, mournful moans. Walcott said that the majority of sheep studied rarely moved during the day, opting instead to stand in one place, often avoiding sunlight and acting only when the food supply in the immediate area was depleted. ""Like many undiagnosed depression sufferers, it seems that a lot of U.S. livestock escape the emotional emptiness of their lives by overeating,"" Walcott said. ""Most appear to care nothing about their personal appearance. And, as any ranch-hand who has ever shoveled manure can tell you, they make only limited effort to keep their physical surroundings in order."" Dr. Theodore Nelson, author of The Slow Slaughter: Growing Up Livestock In An Uncaring World, has made combating bovine ennui his personal mission. ""Sadly, much of our nation's livestock feel they have no future,"" Nelson said. ""They see life as short, brutal, and bereft of purpose. They may appear to be functioning normally—eating feed, producing milk, and generating high volumes of fertilizer—but inside, many are just waiting to die."" In his book, Nelson calls for a federal program to provide Selective Livestock Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors to animals in need. ""The signs that these animals are depressed were right in front of us, but too many of us in the food sciences were blinded by narrow-minded agricultural orthodoxy to see them,"" Nelson said. ""But we can't think this problem will be solved through medication alone. Cattle have to learn to believe in themselves. They've got to see themselves as more than walking hunks of meat or they'll never get better."" The government's report also contained preliminary data suggesting a rate as high as 95 percent for severe anxiety disorder among U.S. poultry."
Report: Scientists Still Seeking Cure For Obesity,7/14/04,4629,"CHICAGO, IL—In spite of billions of dollars spent and decades of research, scientists at the University of Chicago said Monday that the scientific community is no closer to finding a cure for the potentially fatal disease of obesity. ""The obesity epidemic in this country has public-health authorities panicking, and with good reason,"" said Dr. Seong-Hun Kim, a research associate at the university's department of neurobiology, pharmacology, and physiology. ""According to the latest government statistics, 30.6 percent of the adult population and 16.5 percent of children under 19 are obese. As researchers, we feel the same sort of helplessness that many victims of obesity feel."" ""Basically, the clock continues to tick as we search for that golden key that will give every American a chance at a healthy, normal life,"" Kim added. Many obesity sufferers have expressed frustration over the medical community's inability to cure them. ""I came down with obesity two years after I got married,"" 41-year-old Oklahoma City resident Fran Torley said. ""I know it was hard for my husband to watch me suffer from this disease. When he caught obesity a year later, he got so depressed, he couldn't do anything but sit on the couch. Some days, we sit and watch television from dawn till dusk, hoping for news of a breakthrough."" Kim said he sees no cure on the horizon. ""Each year that we don't have a cure for this dreaded condition, another 300,000 Americans die of obesity-related health problems—hypertension, stroke, heart attack, diabetes,"" Kim said. ""I wish to God there were something I could give these people that would make the obesity go away, but so far, there is no pill that can do that safely and effectively."" Kim said the prescription drugs currently indicated in the treatment of obesity, as well as a host of over-the-counter products, have been shown to produce limited results. ""Even when individuals find success with a certain drug or plan, it often fails to work in the long term,"" Kim said. ""Sometimes, a treatment plan that works for a handful of people will fail to help anyone else. It's very frustrating. As evinced by the widespread nature of the problem, scientists aren't doing enough for these poor overweight people."" Kim's research group has tried to pinpoint the genetic, environmental, and psychological factors that might indicate a susceptibility to obesity. ""For example, we know that obesity tends to run in families,"" Kim said. ""But we have yet to pinpoint exactly what it is that causes, say, the Smith family to splash about their backyard pool blissfully unaffected while, just over the fence, the Jones family languishes 30 percent overweight on their barbecue deck."" Marge Hampton is an obese American who has responded to the epidemic by trying to raise awareness and money for obesity research. In May, Hampton coordinated the Obesity Awareness Five-Mile Fun Ride, which led participants on a motor tour of Chicago's waterfront parks, and she orchestrated an obesity-awareness bake sale last month. ""We used to think obesity was a condition that only affected people with glandular problems, but health officials are now seeing just how widespread the epidemic is,"" Hampton said. ""There's a myth that obese people don't want to change. They do—they just lack the information about how to do it quickly and easily."" Kim's research team has explored preventative measures. ""It would be wonderful if we could find some way to prevent individuals from getting this horrible condition in the first place, perhaps with something akin to a vaccine or a flu shot,"" Kim said. ""We've pursued every avenue—pills, topical creams, nutritional shakes, even holistic cures like vitamin regimens and massage—but nothing has worked."" While others might have been discouraged by failure, Kim has intensified his efforts. ""I'm in the lab day and night,"" Kim said. ""The other researchers will say 'Come have dinner with us,' but I'm so busy that I have to just grab some yogurt from the vending machine. I'm just too busy running over to the research facility on the west side of campus or carrying samples to the lab up on the fourth floor. I've lost 20 pounds since starting this project in January."" Even though he expressed concern about his recent weight loss, Kim said he will continue his work unabated. ""I can't worry about me right now; finding a cure for obesity is far too important,"" Kim said. ""And, honestly, I feel better than I've felt in years. My work, although difficult, is energizing. I can't turn my back on my research while, all around me, Americans are dropping like enormous flies."""
Man's Impending Death Alcohol-Related,6/16/04,3964,"MATTOON, IL—In a press conference Monday, Mattoon-area police announced that the early death of Derek Yothers, 42, will be alcohol-related. ""Until we can complete a full investigation, we're considering Yothers' future death to be the result of alcohol poisoning,"" patrolman John O'Malley said. ""However, we haven't ruled out hepatitis, kidney failure, cirrhosis of the liver, acute pancreatitis, Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, or fatal injuries sustained in some kind of drunk-driving accident."" O'Malley said police do not suspect that there will be foul play. ""Yothers' on-again/off-again girlfriend Brandi Freyer could get fed up and shoot him,"" O'Malley said. ""But it's much more likely to be an open-and-shut case in which Yothers drives off the side of a bridge."" ""We'll need the coroner's report before we file this away for good, of course,"" O'Malley added. ""But even if he drunkenly trips on the ice and breaks his neck, burns himself to a cinder after passing out with a lit cigarette in his mouth, or dives through a plate-glass window in a show of bravado and bleeds to death, we'll probably still list 'alcohol' as the cause of death."" Details of Yothers' demise will not be finalized until his weakened, inefficient heart and damaged but functioning brain cease to operate. But police said Yothers—who is unemployed, twice divorced, and freshly released from a 15-month prison sentence in Joliet—is unlikely to drag the case out much longer. ""We marked the time of death sometime between today and two years from now,"" O'Malley said. ""We can't say for sure what his blood-alcohol level will be at the time of death, but we know it will be well past the legal limit. Ever since he lost his job at the camper factory, he's pretty much kept his head in a bottle."" O'Malley described the scene of the future death. ""His body could be found in any number of places—a ditch on Hwy. 57, a stall in the men's room, sprawled out on Brandi's stained mattress,"" O'Malley said. ""In any case, he'll almost certainly be face-down, possibly in his dog's water dish. We're bound to find at least two or three empty Jack Daniel's bottles next to his bed. That is, unless he's waiting on his next unemployment check, in which case those bottles will be Old Crow."" Police notified Yothers' family of his pending death Tuesday. ""That's one phone call you never want to make,"" O'Malley said. ""I've known the Yothers family for years—I end up out at their house for a disturbing-the-peace call every year around the holidays. But they're basically good folks. I hate to give people news like that. It's the toughest part of this job."" Continued O'Malley: ""They took it well. I assured them that he'll probably feel very little pain when he goes, considering how drunk he'll be. That seemed to make them feel better. Really, they've been expecting this for a while."" Derek's older brother, Mark Yothers, spoke on the family's behalf. ""You can't help but feel guilty for not doing more to stop him,"" Mark said. ""If only he could have gotten help, I'd still have my brother here with me three years from now. The only consolation we have is that he'll be in a better place someday, where his soul can find peace."" Other people close to Yothers are bracing themselves for his death. ""I just saw him over at the gas station yesterday,"" said Eric Pugh, Yothers' former coworker. ""He was buying a frozen pizza and a sixer of Miller High Life. He seemed just fine, nothing out of the ordinary at all. We talked about going to that bar over in Effingham for $3 pitchers of Old Style. I sure hope we get a chance to do that before it's too late."" Funeral services for Yothers will be attended by a handful of family members and friends, after which his body will be buried in the family plot. During the gathering, the family will play ""She Talks To Angels"" by The Black Crowes, unless Yothers' favorite song changes between now and the time of his death."

Ex-Nickelodeon Stars Relate Horrors Of Green Slime Syndrome,5/26/04,5605,"OTTAWA—Veterans of the '80s cult classic TV show You Can't Do That On Television filed a $1 billion class-action lawsuit against Nickelodeon Monday, alleging that the network exposed them to a bevy of toxins which led to a chronic affliction called Green Slime Syndrome. ""The producers assured us the slime was safe, and that getting drenched with it for five or more takes wouldn't cause any lasting damage,"" cast member Alasdair Gillis said. ""I was only 12. I didn't ask questions; I just did what the director said. Now I live with constant pain."" Gillis then pulled up his sleeves to reveal the suppurating pustules that cover his forearms and wrists. ""Most days I just sit on the couch and relive the shows,"" Gillis said. ""It's inexcusable that the directors punished me for having the courage to say 'I don't know.'"" You Can't Do That On Television, a Canadian children's sketch-comedy show, aired on Nickelodeon from 1979 to 1990, with a cast largely made up of local amateur child actors. Many sketches were punctuated with physical humor, with the actors frequently doused in slime, water, or foodstuffs. Since YCDTOTV ended production, as many as 50 cast members have complained of a host of symptoms, including chronic pain and fatigue, numbness in the extremities, skin rashes, headache, nausea, and depression. Gillis said he personally was doused with four different colors of slime, as well as spaghetti sauce, ink, mud, motor oil, soup, and silly string—all within the span of one season. ""If you tell people you have GSS, they act like you're just a coddled child actor,"" Gillis added. ""'Part of the harsh reality of show-biz,' they say. But they don't know what it was like, man. Now, 20 years later, I still wince every time I hear someone say 'water.' I still request Evian in restaurants. I can't even be in the same room as a cream pie."" Gillis said cast members didn't file the lawsuit sooner because it took years for their doctors to make the connection between the mysterious ailments and the slime to which victims were exposed during the show. ""I left the show in 1986, and about a year later, I got a rash all over my face that just wouldn't go away,"" Gillis said. ""Then I started having debilitating migraines and shooting pains in my back. It was when my fingers went numb that I knew something had to be wrong. I bounced from doctor to doctor, until a physician in Beverly Hills sat me down and asked me if I'd ever been exposed to comic props. Finally, I knew it wasn't all in my head. I knew it was the slime."" Cast member Marjorie Silcoff said she silently suffered a multitude of painful symptoms for years, until she attended a 1999 YCDTOTV reunion and discovered that many of her co-stars were suffering from similar unexplained ailments. ""When Les Lye [who played popular characters Barth, Ross, Senator Prevort, and El Capitano on the show] walked in with the left side of his face paralyzed, I started crying,"" Silcoff said. ""I had a flashback to Barth standing there in the order window beneath the fly paper, holding up his spatula, getting slimed. It was so tragic. He never even had a chance to say his line, ""That's what's in the burgers.'"" Continued Silcoff: ""We all just stood on the mark like we were told. Christ, when you think about all the things that we were exposed to—mustard, milk, Jell-O, grape soda—it's incredible that we survived at all."" According to Silcoff, Nickelodeon lawyers continue to claim that GSS is just a stress-related ailment or a form of psychological hysteria. ""They tell our doctors, 'Don't encourage them,'"" Silcoff said. ""Some of us gave it our all for 11 years, but that doesn't mean a thing to them. They wish we'd just disappear."" Christine ""Moose"" McGlade, who hosted the show from the first season until 1986, said the cast members' inexperience made them willing to expose themselves to danger. ""We were all so young and gung-ho,"" McGlade said. ""We thought we'd better do our job if we didn't want the troupe as a whole to suffer. When you're on set, the cast is your family. Once you've been in a food fight with someone, there's a bond that can never really be broken. It's hard for non-actors to understand what it's like under the hot lights of the studio."" Nickelodeon's official position on GSS, released in a statement Monday, is that there is ""no scientific evidence of a unique pattern of illness that can be causally linked to television service at Nickelodeon."" ""Nickelodeon would never under any circumstances endanger any of its actors, particularly children,"" the statement read. ""The slime was thoroughly tested and deemed safe. While our sympathies are with the ill actors, Nickelodeon is not responsible for their ailments."" Despite Nickelodeon's denial of wrongdoing, the cast members plan to press on with the lawsuit, pursuing compensation for years of pain and suffering, as well as public acknowledgment of the hidden dangers of sliming. ""Nick is still sliming kids on Slimetime Live—and not just paid actors, either,"" Gillis said. ""These are regular kids from the audience who are willing to place themselves in the path of danger for the promise of winning a Game Boy or a box of Hubba Bubba Bubble Tape. Nick even sells the slime commercially, which, frankly, keeps me up at night."" Continued Gillis: ""We're still imploring [former YCDTOTV cast member] Alanis Morissette to come forward. Her support would do a lot to raise awareness of GSS. But would it be enough to erase the suspicion, resistance, and bitterness that has enveloped discussion of this syndrome from the start? I don't know."""
New Prescription-Only Sandwich Extra Delicious,5/19/04,4159,"NEW YORK—At a press conference Monday, drug giant Pfizer formally introduced Hoagizine, a pharmaceutical-grade Turkey-Bacon-Guacamole Melt so delicious, it's only available by prescription. ""Made with lean white turkey breast, hickory-smoked bacon, zesty guacamole, Boston leaf lettuce, and ripe tomatoes on crusty French bread, Hoagizine is indicated in the treatment of lunchtime satisfaction dysfunction,"" said Stephen Spencer, Pfizer's head of research and product development. ""But Hoagizine is only available after consultation with a physician, so be sure to ask your doctor if this new sandwich is right for you."" The extra-potent sandwich passed rigorous testing in both branches of the FDA in February. In clinical trials, 96 percent of patients who administered the sandwich orally experienced a deliciousness they described as ""heightened,"" ""intense,"" or even ""overwhelming."" In the same trial, only 16 percent of those who received placebo sandwiches reported experiencing high levels of deliciousness. In preparation for Monday's announcement, Pfizer produced 800,000 units of the oral sandwich and distributed them to pharmacies nationwide. Additionally, Pfizer personnel sent out samples of Hoagizine and educated physicians on patient-screening procedures, treatment regimens, and serving suggestions. ""This sandwich is extremely effective in the treatment of severe acute and chronic hunger,"" Pfizer spokesman Abdul Johnson said. ""For consumers who find that their regular sandwich is no longer effectively reducing pangs, the Turkey-Bacon-Guacamole Melt represents a good treatment option."" Johnson said Pfizer may soon offer an even more potent version of the sandwich, Hoagizine CM, which contains 10 grams of chipotle mayonnaise. Consumer interest in the new Turkey-Bacon-Guacamole Melt is high. Physicians filled thousands of sandwich prescriptions within 24 hours after it was made available. ""I guess I'm not the only one who finds regular sandwiches ineffective,"" said Rock Falls, ID resident Lois Baird, as she sat in her physician's waiting room. ""Frankly, I'd just about given up on bread-and-meat treatments, but if this sandwich is going to help me eat a better, tastier lunch, I want it."" Baird added: ""I just hope it's okay to mix Hoagizine with the broad-spectrum soup I currently take at noon."" Although most insurance companies cover prescriptions for the Turkey-Bacon-Guacamole Melt, many physicians recommend that their patients stick to over-the-lunch-counter sandwiches. ""Hoagizine is a powerfully delicious sandwich,"" said Dr. Erin O'Malley, chief nutritionist at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. ""And there's the problem: It's overkill. Commercially available, high-quality sandwiches are delicious enough for 95 percent of the patients I see. Additionally, those patients who do actually require the extra zest and deliciousness of this medical-grade melt run the risk of becoming addicted to its scrumptious flavor. I consider the sandwich to be an emergency lunch option, for use only when everything on the menu looks so blah that it threatens to ruin your entire day."" Pfizer officials said the Turkey-Bacon-Guacamole Melt comes with some warnings, but that it poses few health risks and, for the most part, is made of all-natural ingredients. Those who are overweight, diabetic, or allergic to wheat or dairy, or have a history of heart disease are urged to seek medical counseling before ordering the melt, and women who are pregnant may require a second dose of Hoagizine. In Pfizer's lab tests, common side effects of the sandwich included a bloated or drowsy feeling, thirst, and a heightened desire for a side order of chips. If discomfort occurs, patients are urged to temporarily discontinue use of the Turkey-Bacon-Guacamole Melt and lie down on the couch. ""Side effects are certainly within the parameters established for commercially available lunch items,"" Spencer said. ""The one thing we're concerned with is that, with regular use, the bacon and the guacamole could precipitate high cholesterol levels in some patients. But, hey, if your cholesterol does get a little high, that's why we make Lipitor."""
Apparently Werewolf Was Allergic To Peanuts,5/19/04,706,"NEW ORLEANS—The werewolf who died while attacking a young woman Sunday must have been allergic to peanuts, experts said Tuesday. ""The wolfman crashed through the intended victim's front window, but before the accursed beast could tear her apart in a savage fury, he stepped in a bowl of honey-roasted peanuts,"" said Dr. Alex Price, professor of lycanthropic studies at Tulane University. ""Within seconds, the hellbeast's face began to swell, and he collapsed into an anaphylactic attack, unable to breathe."" Price said that, had the werewolf not been more animal than man at the time of the attack, he likely would have used the epinephrine injection pen paramedics found in the breast pocket of his shirt."
Senatorial Candidate Introduces New Low-Carb Platform,4/21/04,3657,"COLUMBIA, SC—Mayor of Myrtle Beach and Republican Senate hopeful Mark McBride jumped ahead in the polls Monday after announcing his new low-carbohydrate political platform. ""The people of South Carolina have allowed starchy politics to become a staple in their diets,"" McBride said, addressing a crowd of supporters at a capitol-area convention center. ""You are what you vote for, and when you vote for McBride, you're telling Washington that you want a leader with meaty ideas. You're telling them you aren't going to swallow any more sugar-coated lies."" Having failed to capture voter interest with his previous platform of lower taxes, increased support for job programs, and tort reform, McBride decided a low-carb message was more likely to resonate with voters. ""Americans have asked for a leaner government, and they've been handed bread and circuses,"" McBride said. ""What we have now is a lethargic ruling body, willing to down anything that special-interest groups spoon-feed them. I'm gonna put an end to that. A vote for me is a vote for this country's long-term health."" South Carolina voters have responded enthusiastically to McBride's low-carb initiative, boosting the candidate as many as 11 points in recent polls. ""I'm on Atkins, so I always keep my eye out for new low-carb choices,"" Pauline Illford said, holding a campaign flyer that read ""McBride: Great for Atkins dieters!"" ""I used to see McBride as just another white-bread politician from South Carolina. But his new campaign has really got me energized. Compared to him, all the other candidates seem really bland or hard to follow."" McBride said that, if elected, he'll push Congress to ""cut the excess weight that's dragging the U.S. budget down."" ""Take one look at the fat cats living large off your taxes, and you'll agree that the old way wasn't working,"" McBride said. ""If you send me to Washington, you'll get quick results. You'll see a noticeable change within weeks. The first day I'm sworn into office, you'll notice a leaner, healthier government."" McBride declined to give specifics about which policies he'll vote for, but he did hand reporters coupons for the steak-and-shrimp dinner at his restaurant, Crabman's Seafood and Country Buffet. ""As mayor of Myrtle Beach and owner of a popular local restaurant, I've learned a thing or two,"" said McBride, who changed his restaurant's menu to reflect his low-carb program last year. ""I've been listening to the people of this great state, and the majority of them want to know one thing: Do you have anything low-carb?"" ""I know what's good for South Carolina, as my public-service record and the success of my restaurant clearly prove,"" McBride said, before taking a bite of a salmon steak wrapped in romaine lettuce. Democrat Inez Tenenbaum, the race's former frontrunner, has yet to comment on her opponent's platform. Despite the popularity of the low-carb campaign, Tenenbaum has chosen to stick to her original goals of job creation, affordable healthcare, and increased national security. ""Tenenbaum isn't running a quick-and-easy fad campaign,"" said Jack Rissol, a reporter from the Charleston Post And Courier. ""She's going the long route, hoping constituents come back around to the idea that the only way to get long-term change in government is to consume a balanced array of fresh ideas and regularly exercise one's right to vote."" ""On the other hand, there's plenty of evidence that McBride's new platform is working,"" Rissol added. ""I thought it sounded crazy at first, too, and that there was no way a platform like that could possibly work. But there's no denying it: McBride looks great in those polls."""

New Nietzschean Diet Lets You Eat Whatever You Fear Most,3/03/04,5438,"NEW YORK—While dieters are accustomed to exercises of will, a new English translation of Germany's most popular diet book takes the concept to a new philosophical level. The Nietzschean diet, which commands its adherents to eat superhuman amounts of whatever they most fear, is developing a strong following in America. Fat Is Dead, proclaims the ambitious title of the dense, aphoristic nutrition plan, which was written by Friedrich Nietzsche in the late 1880s and unearthed three years ago. After reaching bestseller lists in Europe, the book was translated into English by R.J. Hollingdale and published by Avon last month. ""One must strive to eat dangerously as one comes into the Will to Power Oneself Thin,"" Nietzsche wrote. ""What do you fear? By this are you truly Fattened. You must embrace your Fears, as well as your Fat, and learn to Laugh as you consume them, along with Generous Portions of Simple Salad. Remember, as you stare into the lettuce, the lettuce stares also into you."" First formulated by Nietzsche, who felt lassitude and weltschmerz overcome him after a steady diet of Schopenhauer, the diet retains elements of that philosopher's ""The Fruit Bowl As Will And Representation,"" but adds a persuasive personal challenge. ""The basics of the Nietzschean regimen are simple,"" Hollingdale wrote in the book's foreword. ""The dieter exercises a painful amount of self-honesty in order to identify the primary object of his or her deepest human dread as personified by a wide-ranging group of foodstuffs. Once the dieter's Fear has been identified, he eats that food exclusively, in unlimited amounts, until the food no longer appetizes or frightens him. Having completed his gorge and transcended his fear, the dieter fasts for 20 days on water and Simple Salad. The dieter also engages in moderate metaphysical exercise, drinks eight brimming bowls of water every day, and 'opens the Gates of Dread and Fiber that remain closed to him in his Mundane Life' by taking fiber supplements."" ""By conquering your Fear, by eating it in Heroic Portions, by laughing at that Fear which you have eaten, one avoids the Eternal Recurrence of cyclic 'Yo-Yo' Weight Loss and Weight Gain,"" Nietzsche wrote. ""And in so doing, one transcends Thinness. One discovers that he need not dwell forever on the chill, Wind-swept Borderland between Thin and Superthin."" Fat Is Dead is selling briskly, as are the accompanying recipe pamphlets Beyond Food And Evil; Human, All Too Fat A Human; and Swiss Steak Zarathustra. Dieters report that they are reveling in the powerful Nietzschean weight-loss message of self-realization, transcendence, and the personal freedom to eat certain foods which are not allowed on the Atkins and South Beach diets. ""The Carbohydrate is Evil—all the wisest Men in Weight Loss have told us this,"" the 398-page book notes. ""Oh, Fools who would run from Evil! What you say is true! But Only in Evil, and the passing of Evil, does a Dieter find his Strength! Only by eating of the Pasta and the Bread are we free! For the Greatest Evils are necessary for Man to achieve the Weight Loss of a Superman! As are Fasts and Fiber Tablets."" Many Nietzschean dieters are reporting success, although some complain of side effects. Kansas City's John Mencken started the diet in January. He lost 35 pounds, eight inches from his waistline, and many of his slave moralities. He also lost the love of his life, Marissa Hapsgood, who walked out on Mencken after discovering his involvement in a romantic triangle with a poet and a sculptress. ""What makes one skinny?"" Mencken said. ""To contemplate as with one mind two things: great fear and great hope. For when seen through a vitamin-fortified protein shake, are they not the same thing?"" ""What do you call 'bad'? Eating restricted amounts of that which shames you. What makes one most human? To spare shame to oneself,"" said Pete Hundmuth of Chicago, whose health and potency were severely shaken before he found the diet. ""But where is your greatest danger? In pity and in sugar. By consuming pity in the form of a raw cookie dough, I am transformed."" ""Behold!"" Hundmuth said, casting off his bathrobe and stepping out into the cold light of his garret. ""I have rid myself of your mundane, earthly, narrow concept of Love Handles!"" The Nietzschean diet has its critics. Detractors say the diet's actual nutritional requirements are vague, that it provides no concrete plan for progression toward weight-loss targets, and that the book consists mostly of unclear and unusually harsh sets of inspirational logical lacunae. ""Those on Nietzsche's diet must remember that, while discipline and mastering one's fear are desirable, the specter of a man striving willfully and joyfully against a frigid universe while drinking deep of 'life's bitter broth' will not precipitate weight loss,"" nutritionist Dr. Frank Stearns said. ""A few more non-allegorical recipes would have been nice, too."" Stearns said it was worth noting that Nietzsche died depressed, delirious, and overweight in Zurich after 10 years of near-catatonia. ""Those wishing to begin a diet, let alone a highly moralistic pre-Freudian diet, should consult with their physicians,"" Stearns said. ""Otherwise, they run the risk of long-term health problems—not to mention the possibility of their diet being misinterpreted by a rabidly cuisinophobic nationalist sect and used to justify a world takeover by diet Nazis."""
Virulent Strain Of Soy Flu Traced To Single Tofurkey,3/03/04,594,"SAN FRANCISCO—A virulent strain of soy flu has been traced to a single tofurkey at a Bay Area food-processing factory. ""An investigation of Green Earth Foods has located the bird-shaped loaf of firm bean curd from which the infection originated,"" said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""To prevent further spreading of the disease, all tofurkeys in Northern California are being quarantined and destroyed."" Gerberding said it appears that the soy virus was not transmitted to the factory's Spaghetti & Wheatballs Microwaveable Entree division."
Man Kinda Excited For Internal Camera Procedure,2/25/04,574,"FREDERICK, MD—Two days before his scheduled colonoscopy, Barry Feldman, 47, told his wife Joyce he was ""kinda excited"" by the idea of a camera taking internal pictures of him, sources reported Tuesday. ""I'm a little nervous about the test results, but it sure is amazing that they'll be taking photos with a camera the size of a pencil eraser!"" Feldman said. ""I talked to the doctor, and he said I'll be able to watch the whole thing on a monitor. He said they can even make me a video tape!"" Feldman added that he hopes he doesn't pass out from the pain and miss something."
Study: Most Self-Abuse Goes Unreported,1/28/04,4679,"BOULDER—According to a study released Tuesday by the University of Colorado sociology department, approximately 95 percent of self-abuse cases in the U.S. go unreported. ""As shocking as it may seem, unreported incidents of self-abuse number in the billions,"" said Dr. Henry Cracklin, director of the study. ""This isn't just the plight of teenage boys and truck drivers. Self-abuse affects both genders and all ages. Nevertheless, a great majority of victims suffer the abuse in silence."" The study's results, obtained through five years of surveys and interviews, indicate that millions of Americans have publicly acknowledged involvement in a self-abusive relationship. Yet the study finds that unreported abuse victims comprise an alarming 87 percent of the female population and 99.6 percent of males. ""In many cases, the self-abuse occurs repeatedly over the course of a lifetime, with the victims believing themselves powerless to break the cycle of shame, embarrassment, and self-loving,"" Cracklin said. ""The sad reality is that, if you know a man or woman between the ages of 12 and 80, you know a self-abuse victim."" Just as alarming as the high incidence of abuse, Cracklin said, is the fact that it's impossible to predict where it will occur. ""Our surveys indicate that self-abuse incidents are unpredictable,"" Cracklin said. ""They can occur at any time and in any place. Study participants were abused in their own beds, in showers, in the bathroom stalls of college dorms. It's happened in the parking lot during lunch hour, at the beach, in library basements, and even in vehicles moving along the highway at night."" Cracklin added: ""It may be happening to someone you love, right at this very moment."" According to Janet Linstrom, founder of Mothers Against Self Touch-Abuse, family members and friends who suspect that a minor is being self-abused often do nothing, because they believe the child's claim that he simply enjoys being left alone. ""The self-abuse victim will often withdraw from the family. He'll forgo group activities, opting instead to spend hours locked in his bedroom, surfing the Internet,"" Linstrom said. ""Unfortunately, I am all too aware of the danger signs. You see, both my husband and I were self-abused."" Support-group leaders like Linstrom address the problem one victim at a time. ""Many victims are reluctant to seek help,"" Linstrom said. ""Their abusers have isolated them from friends and family, so there's no one for them to reach out to. For many, the abuser is the only intimate friend they have."" ""Truth be told, victims sometimes report deriving some sort of satisfaction from the self-abuse,"" Linstrom said, ""There's an intensity to abusive relationships that many self-abuse victims don't find elsewhere. Many will say, 'No one else makes me feel this way.'"" Added Linstrom: ""That's why we focus on the younger ones. We've been working in the schools, but it's an uphill battle. We hear scores of second- and third-hand accounts of self-abuse, but it's not easy to get students to share stories of their own victimization."" In spite of the stranglehold self-abuse has on the population, few sources of help are available to victims, said Sister Joselda Hattchett, founder of St. Mary's Self-Abuse Shelter in Denver, a Catholic charity group dedicated to counseling self-abuse victims. ""As far as I'm aware, we're one of the few institutions specifically designed to handle the fallout from these attacks,"" Hattchett said. ""Incredible as it may seem, those who are brave enough to report the self-abuse often find that their claims are not taken seriously. Some victims are even laughed at."" Hattchett said the shelter provides a self-abuse hotline, but the 900-number seems to do more harm than good. ""We placed ads in the back of men's magazines and newsweeklies,"" Hattchett said. ""The sisters find that the majority of the victims who reach out to them are unable to escape their tormentors, even during a short phone call. We thought having non-threatening, soft-voiced women answer the phones would make it easier for victims to discuss the problem, but most callers only seem interested in the operators' fashion choices or whether they like to 'party.'"" Hattchett said the hardest part of her job is seeing self-abuse victims who were brave enough to come forward fall back into the hands of their abusers. ""It's difficult to get self-abuse victims to stop blaming themselves for what's happened,"" Hattchett said. ""They think it's their fault, because they're too weak to resist. And, despite everything that has happened, they often maintain strong feelings for their abusers. I've seen it happen time and time again."""
So-Called Obese Pets Held To Unrealistic Body Standards,12/17/03,4004,"CHICAGO—To the casual eye, Tippy might appear to be a regular Labrador. He loves sunbathing at the park, watching squirrels, and getting loads of attention from passersby. But Tippy is not a normal dog. By veterinarians' standards, he is 65 pounds overweight. A closer examination of Tippy's body reveals a rounded abdomen, thick limbs, and a fleshy neck and back. And, unlike dogs seen on television and in magazines, Tippy does not have a discernible waistline or ribcage. ""I don't care if people say he's chubby,"" said Tippy's owner Katherine Mathers, gently scratching the dog's protruding belly. ""So what if he doesn't look like the dog in the Iams commercial? What's more important: having a perfect body or being happy? I love him whether he's 25, 50, or even 150 pounds overweight. In fact, I think he's the cutest dog in the world."" ""Yes, you are!"" said Mathers, waving the remaining half of her cookie in front of Tippy's nose. Mathers is not alone in defending her pet. Amid a barrage of commercials for new diet dog and cat foods, many owners say that their pets are being held to impossibly high animal-body standards perpetrated by the media. ""I don't care what anyone says, my Sassy looks good,"" said Janice Guswhite, owner of a Persian longhair that cannot climb the stairs to her home's second floor without becoming short of breath. ""Who's to say how big a cat is supposed to be, anyway?"" The American Veterinary Medical Association is trying. The organization recently announced that nearly one-fourth of all U.S. cats and dogs are overweight. While many owners say they are comfortable with their pets' extra weight, the AVMA says ignoring pet obesity could have dire health consequences. ""Many pet owners might think it's cute when Sparky lies next to his food bowl all day because he doesn't have the energy to walk away from it,"" said Dr. Ken Janokovski, spokesman for the AVMA. ""But overweight animals are susceptible to diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, pancreatitis, and a host of other illnesses."" ""By simply lowering the number of times you fill the food bowl, and providing enough space to exercise, you can dramatically increase your pet's quality of life,"" Janokovski said. ""Pets are part of your family. You should treat them accordingly."" In spite of the possible health risks, many owners of so-called obese pets insist that a few extra pounds can't hurt their dogs, cats, or guinea pigs. ""Animals know how and when to eat by instinct,"" said Travis Linsom, owner of a clinically overweight hamster. ""Oscar only eats what he needs, then keeps the rest in his pouch while he sleeps in the corner all day. That's just how hamsters are. I'm not going to force Oscar to get on the wheel just because some vet is freaking out about hypoglycemia."" Pet body-image activist Miriam Grimer said owners shouldn't let doctors dictate their pets' weight. ""It's insulting that 'experts' are telling our pets how to live,"" Grimer said. ""Our pets are perfectly fine with the way they look. No animal should be forced to live up to the unobtainable standard of beauty on the cover of a magazine like Cat Fancy."" Preferring terms like ""plump,"" ""stout,"" and ""curvy,"" Eric Willis said he's proud that his 110-pound golden retriever has ""a little something on the hindquarters."" ""Jasmine might not be able to run as fast as other dogs, but when I take her to the park, you can bet she gets noticed by the male dogs,"" Willis said. ""Not like Clementine, that skinny little English pointer down the block. Her owner must not care about her at all. "" Pet owners like Willis say they have no intention of changing their feeding habits. ""No one's going to tell me that Tippy isn't beautiful the way he is,"" Mathers said. ""If he wants to lose weight, that's fine. But he doesn't have to do it for me, or the vet, or even my husband, who doesn't want Tippy allowed in the living room because of his intestinal troubles. I think Tippy's perfect, even if he can't fit through his doggy door anymore."""
FDA Approves Sale Of Prescription Placebo,9/17/03,4448,"WASHINGTON, DC—After more than four decades of testing in tandem with other drugs, placebo gained approval for prescription use from the Food and Drug Administration Monday. ""For years, scientists have been aware of the effectiveness of placebo in treating a surprisingly wide range of conditions,"" said Dr. Jonathan Bergen of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""It was time to provide doctors with this often highly effective option."" In its most common form, placebo is a white, crystalline substance of a sandy consistency, obtained from the evaporated juice of the Saccharum officinarum plant. The FDA has approved placebo in doses ranging from 1 to 40,000 milligrams. The long-awaited approval will allow pharmaceutical companies to market placebo in pill and liquid form. Eleven major drug companies have developed placebo tablets, the first of which, AstraZeneca's Sucrosa, hits shelves Sept. 24. ""We couldn't be more thrilled to finally get this wonder drug out of the labs and into consumers' medicine cabinets,"" said Tami Erickson, a spokeswoman for AstraZeneca. ""Studies show placebo to be effective in the treatment of many ailments and disorders, ranging from lower-back pain to erectile dysfunction to nausea."" Pain-sufferers like Margerite Kohler, who participated in a Sucrosa study in March, welcomed the FDA's approval. ""For years, I battled with strange headaches that surfaced during times of stress,"" Kohler said. ""Doctors repeatedly turned me away empty-handed, or suggested that I try an over-the-counter pain reliever—as if that would be strong enough. Finally, I heard about Sucrosa. They said, 'This will work,' and it worked. The headaches are gone."" Researchers diagnosed Kohler with Random Occasional Nonspecific Pain and Discomfort Disorder (RONPDD), a minor but surprisingly pervasive medical condition that strikes otherwise healthy adults. RONPDD is only one of many disorders for which placebo has proven effective, Bergen said. ""Placebo has been successful in the treatment of everything from lower-back pain to erectile dysfunction to nausea,"" Bergen said. ""That's the beauty, and the mystery, of placebo. It's all-purpose. Think of it like aspirin, but without any of the analgesic properties."" The FDA is expected to approve the drug for a wide range of mood disorders later this year. According to Bergen, initial research has shown placebo to be effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder, depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and stress. As industry analysts predict the drug's sales will top $25 billion in the first year, the approval of placebo is expected to unleash one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest marketing battles to date. GlaxoSmithKline expects to have two versions of placebo on the shelves in late December. One, a 40-milligram pill called Appeasor, will be marketed to patients 55 and over, while the other, Inertra, designed for middle-aged women, is a liquid that comes in a 355-milliliter can, and is cola-flavored. Eli Lilly plans a $3 million marketing campaign for its 400-milligram tablet, Pacifex. ""All placebos are not the same,"" Eli Lilly spokesman Giles French said. ""Pacifex is the only placebo that's green and shaped like a triangle. Pacifex: A doctor gave it to you."" Despite such ringing endorsements, some members of the medical community have spoken out against placebo's approval, saying that the drug's wide range of side effects is a cause for concern. ""Yes, placebo has benefits, but studies link it to a hundred different side effects, from lower-back pain to erectile dysfunction to nausea,"" drug researcher Patrick Wheeler said. ""Placebo wreaked havoc all over the body, with no rhyme or reason. Basically, whichever side effects were included on the questionnaire, we found in research subjects."" Added Wheeler: ""We must not introduce placebo to the public until we pinpoint exactly how and why it works. The drug never should have advanced beyond the stage of animal testing, which, for some reason, was totally ineffective in determining its effectiveness."" In spite of the confusing data, drug makers say placebo is safe. ""The only side effect consistent in all test subjects was a negligible one—an almost imperceptible elevation in blood-glucose levels,"" French said. ""It's unfair to the American people to withhold a drug so many of them desperately think they need."""

Manic-Depressive Friend A Blast While Manic,6/04/03,4696,"BUFFALO, NY—Manic-depressive Tom Ruzek, 24, may be a ""total drag for months on end,"" but he is ""a blast"" while in his manic state, friends of the troubled Buffalo State graduate student said Monday. Ruzek, diagnosed with manic depression three years ago by psychiatrists at Mount Zion Mental Health Center, has suffered from the disorder since high school. His condition causes him to experience cyclical bouts of prolonged depression followed by spells of mania, characterized by irrational feelings of elation, delusions of grandeur, and boundless energy. It is in this heightened state, friends say, that Ruzek is awesome. ""Sometimes, Tom can be a real downer,"" said roommate Eric Callas, 23. ""He'll hole up in his room, and if you try to talk to him, all he does is bitch, bitch, bitch. But once you get to know him better, you see that he's got this totally wild-and-crazy, life-of-the-party side, too. When that comes out, everybody's all like, 'All right! The ol' Tomster we know and love is back!'"" According to friends, the manic version of Ruzek possesses many fun, attractive qualities. These include his propensity for outrageous, elaborately choreographed table-top dance numbers at bars and restaurants, his ability to go without sleep for up to 72 hours at a time during spur-of-the-moment road trips, and his wildly generous spending sprees, during which he lavishes friends with expensive gifts in spite of his massive debt. ""Once, we were hanging out at the mall when, out of nowhere, Tom bought me this remote-controlled, gas-powered miniature helicopter for my birthday, even though my birthday wasn't for another five months,"" Ruzek friend Cris Harbaugh said. ""We had a ton of fun flying it around the parking lot, buzzing cars and freaking people out until the mall-security guy told us to leave. Tom got so worked up about getting busted, he filled the toy with M-80s and blew it up in midair—right there in the outdoor food court. Man, what a great day that was."" Friends also enjoy watching Ruzek cut loose on one of his wild, stream-of-consciousness rants. ""Tom's got this web page he keeps, and sometimes a month or more will go by where he doesn't do any updates, except for really short entries like 'Peed in a jar today rather than leave bed,'"" friend Alicia Reynolds said. ""But then, sometimes he'll get on these jags where he'll write, like, 20 pages in a single day—hilarious, over-the-top stuff about how every one of us is a white-hot energy source extending to every corner of the universe."" Compounding his manic episodes, Ruzek will often neglect to take his daily dose of mood-stabilizing medication, believing he doesn't need it. ""Tom got so down last winter, he started taking heavy doses of antidepressants,"" Reynolds said. ""I was really worried about him, but he recently told me he's gotten so much better, he no longer needs artificial substances to be happy. He says he's off the pills and high on life. What a great new attitude. It's hard to believe there was a time when he was so bummed out, he didn't eat any solid food other than Doritos for a month."" Added Reynolds: ""Check out these photos he took of himself in the mirror. He just got a new digital camera, and he e-mailed me the test pictures he took of himself, just to see if it worked. He must have taken, like, 250 of them."" Though Ruzek's friends describe him as ""moody,"" ""excitable,"" and ""a little psycho,"" most are unaware of the seriousness of his condition. According to his therapist, Dr. Howard Wenger, this is due to a combination of the shame manic-depressives like Ruzek feel about revealing their illness and the public's lack of knowledge about the condition. ""What these people don't realize is that Tom has a deadly serious mental illness that, left untreated, will wreak untold havoc on his life,"" Wenger said. ""He is trapped in a self-destructive cycle that could one day prove fatal. There is nothing 'fun' about his disorder, no matter how it appears to outsiders. Tom is a very sick man."" Told of Wenger's appraisal, Ruzek strenuously disagreed. ""Me? I'm fine,"" Ruzek said. ""In fact, I'm so far beyond fine as to be essentially perfect. I would go so far as to say that I am the most perfect being ever to walk God's green earth. Hey, who wants pizza? I'm buying. No, wait—Chinese. No, wait—sushi. No, wait—where are my car keys? I feel like driving 100 miles an hour around the parking lot of that abandoned screen-door factory at the edge of town. Let's blast some Andrew W.K. and scream at the top of our lungs until dawn."" ""Hey, world, look at me, I'm the King of Siam!"" added Ruzek, before collapsing to the floor in a state of physical and emotional exhaustion."

Pfizer Launches 'Zoloft For Everything' Ad Campaign,5/14/03,4062,"NEW YORK–Seeking to broaden the customer base of the popular drug, Pfizer announced the launch of a $40 million ""Zoloft For Everything"" advertising campaign Monday. ""Zoloft is most commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders, but it would be ridiculous to limit such a multi-functional drug to these few uses,"" Pfizer spokesman Jon Pugh said.

Dozens Dead In Chicago-Area Meatwave,5/07/03,3749,"CHICAGO–A deadly meatwave swept through the Chicago area over the weekend, leaving an estimated 40 residents dead of steaks, chops, ribs, bacon, and various other forms of meat exhaustion. “This is easily the worst meatwave I’ve seen around these parts since the summer of ‘79,” said John Gruznek, a Chicago gravicologist. “Most of the bodies I’ve examined were bloated beyond all recognition.” “The excessively high level of pork loins, sirloin tips, bratwurst, and other meats was indisputably the number-one factor in these deaths,” said Chicago mayor Richard Daley, speaking from his temporary command center at Ruth’s Chris Steak House on North Dearborn Street. “Most of these people consumed a considerable fraction of their weight in animal flesh before ultimately succumbing to meatstroke.” “This meatwave,” Daley continued, “is a clear hazard to anyone capable of chewing and swallowing Chicago’s vast array of delicious, succulent meats.” Max Peltz, director of Emergency Medical Services And Barbecue for Cook County, said that non-stop ingestion of beef, pork, chicken, lamb, and veal had caused the victims’ digestive systems–and, ultimately, their entire bodies–to shut down. “The human body, as you may be aware, is roughly 60 percent water,” Peltz said. “However, many don’t realize that it’s also 75 percent meat. If that percentage rises too high too quickly, it may result in a distended stomach, intestinal bloating, and even death. Believe me, it’s not a pretty way to go. A coroner never forgets the first time he examines the body of someone who died from roast-traumatic stress.” According to Peltz, the meatwave victims’ causes of death have ranged from cardiac beefurcation to smoked-sausage inhalation. There has even been one confirmed indirect meat-related fatality, a 51-year-old Evanston man who died from a catastrophic smothering in mushrooms and onions. Chicago public-health officials are urging residents to stay in their homes, advising them to lay out extra napkins and carving forks, drink plenty of water, and venture outside only to procure Zantac, Tums, and Immodium AD. Yet despite such warnings, the meatwave-related casualties continue to mount. “This happens every few years in Chicago,” said emergency worker Peter Barreras. “People in this town act pretty tough, and they always say the same things: ‘I can handle the meat.’ Or ‘You call this a hot dog?’ Or, my favorite, ‘It’s just a hot wing. How much can one little hot wing hurt me?’ Well, I’ll tell you. A lot.” Barreras said that for a meatstroke victim, familiarity with basic first-aid can be the difference between life and death. “If you or someone you’re eating with collapses from The Meats, know what to do,” Barreras said. “Many people think that administering them emergency salads or tofu is the way to go, but the shock to the system is too great. Bring their meat index down gently and gradually by first immersing them in cold cuts. Call a doctor and talk to them while you wait for help to arrive. Under no circumstances should you let them have another pork chop, ham slice, or New York strip. Administer a solution of turkey tetrachloride, give them coffee, and don’t let them lose consciousness.” Meateorologists speculate that the deadly meatwave was caused by a stationary high-protein ridge extending along the shore of Lake Michigan. They fear that Milwaukee and Kansas City could be next. “Mother Nature sure has cooked us up a big one this time,” Peltz said. “If it’s this bad now, imagine what’ll land on the city’s plate during Taste Of Chicago.” If the meatwave continues through next week as predicted, the death toll could reach 100, making it the worst natural food disaster since the San Francisco Panquake of 1970."
Recovering Alcoholic Clearly Kind Of Proud Of Once Being An Alcoholic,4/30/03,4239,"BURNSVILLE, MN—Recovering alcoholic Tim Schwann, 33, still clearly takes a certain pride in his hard-drinking days, sources reported Monday. ""Man, did I used to put it away,"" said Schwann, nursing a soda at a recent party. ""Look at me. I weigh, like, 160. You'd never guess a guy my size could pound a case of Miller Genuine Draft, a fifth of schnapps, and a bottle of Mad Dog over the course of six hours. I was a machine."" Despite renouncing alcohol following a 2001 stint in rehab, Schwann seems to romanticize his years of heavy drinking, frequently waxing nostalgic about the days when his life was dedicated to the consumption of beer and liquor. ""One time, Rob [Reilly] came over on a Sunday afternoon, and we plowed through two cases like it was nothing,"" Schwann said. ""Around 6:30, we realized we were out of beer and had to make a run for more, but the stupid liquor stores were closed. We ended up driving all the way to Wisconsin to find a store that still sold beer on Sunday. We didn't care: We were hell-bent on partying, and when we finally got back, that's exactly what we did. Big time."" Even though Schwann hasn't gone into Sullivan's Wake, the site of many of his ugliest drinking bouts, in nearly two years, he said he still holds a special place in his heart for the bar. ""Sullivan's was the best,"" Schwann said. ""All the guys from the machine shop used to drink there after work. In the morning, you'd see guys from the third shift waiting for the bar to open at 8 a.m., and I was usually right there with them. Mike, the owner, told me he had to order an extra keg of MGD per week after I started showing up. He used to say I was putting his kids through college—which was kind of ironic considering I got kicked out of high school for sneaking vodka into class."" One of Schwann's favorite binge-drinking stories involves stealing a keg of beer from a University of Minnesota fraternity house. ""This is about nine years ago,"" Schwann said. ""My roommate Andy [Stavokakis] and I swiped this full keg that was being delivered to the Fiji house for a party that night. We ended up drinking the whole thing in two days. We were so drunk, we forgot to add ice, so the beer was warm most of the second day. We didn't care. We were crazy back then, and warm beer wasn't going to stop us."" According to friends, Schwann rarely tells stories of events that occurred during his past 20 months of sobriety. ""If I ask him about some rock show he went to over the weekend, he'll have nothing to say,"" coworker Henry Blount said. ""But if the subject of beer comes up, he suddenly springs to life. It's pretty clear that he considers his drinking days the best of his life, even though the stories always end up with him in jail or vomiting in a Stop-N-Go."" Schwann finally decided to check himself into the Helping Hand Detox Center in June 2001 after being fired from his machinist job and going on ""a bender to end all benders."" Over the course of three days, Schwann demolished his 1984 Chevette, accidentally set fire to his apartment, and passed out on the porch of an old girlfriend's house. ""Dude, you should have seen me, I was so fucked up,"" Schwann said. ""I knew I needed help, but you can't keep a party guy like me down, so right after waking up on the porch, I went off on another pub crawl. I wound up curled up on Melissa's front door again. After she got done yelling at me for being an asshole, she drove me to the rehab center. She never did forgive me for taking a shit on her lawn."" Since going sober, Schwann has dramatically turned his life around, earning his GED and enrolling in night classes at a St. Paul community college. He has also renewed his interest in woodworking, a hobby he abandoned after smashing all his projects in a 1998 whiskey-induced rage. ""I've been sober for almost two years now, and I finally feel like I'm in control of my life,"" Schwann said. ""Sure, drinking Shirley Temples and going to AA meetings isn't as exciting as waking up in a ditch with a splitting headache and no clue how you got there. But even though I miss all those fun times, I don't miss the actual drinking that much. Besides, I know in my heart that if I wanted to, I could still out-drink anyone out there."""
U.S. Dentists Can't Make Nation's Teeth Any Damn Whiter,4/23/03,3450,"WASHINGTON, DC–In an official statement Monday, a spokesman for the American Dental Association announced that it cannot make the teeth of the nation's citizens any goddamn whiter. ""As medical professionals, there is a limit to how white we can make your teeth,"" ADA president T. Howard Jones said. ""Using various new tooth-whitening procedures, we can remove the extrinsic staining from your teeth and make them look their absolute whitest. But that's still not enough for you psychos. You need whiter. Well, if you want to go to Mexico and have someone implant a black light in your gums so your teeth glow an unearthly white, go nuts. I'm just telling you what we're medically and legally capable of at this time."" Jones said Americans enjoy a staggering variety of teeth-whitening options, including lasers, gels, bleaches, strips, rinses, pastes, and carbamide-peroxide trays from such makers as Rembrandt, Brite Smile, Perfect Smile, PowerWhite, Rapid White, and Pearl Drops. But despite the seemingly limitless dental-bleaching procedures and products available, Jones said the nation's vain populace is still not satisfied. ""We're not holding anything back, honest,"" Jones said. ""If there was some way to make your teeth whiter, we'd be thrilled to offer it to you and charge you an arm and a leg for it. You're just going to have to come to grips with the fact that your teeth have a slight natural tint. Unless you want us to start painting your teeth with correction fluid, you'll have to accept that cruel fact."" Jones stressed that the ADA has nothing against tooth whitening, noting that most of its 147,000 members offer everything from laser bleaching to porcelain veneers to dental bonding. The typical ADA dentist, however, is irked by customers who come in for routine bleaching and leave disappointed because ""their teeth don't inflict retinal damage when you look directly into them."" ""Hey, if your teeth are stained or discolored, come on in, and we'll fix you up,"" Jones said. ""Professional teeth bleaching can whiten your teeth upwards of five shades, but once they reach their limit, that's it. You need to stop comparing your teeth to your refrigerator."" Citizens across the U.S. are expressing confusion over the ADA's defensive tone. ""I don't see why they're getting all huffy,"" said St. Paul, MN, resident Tamara Wenders, her words garbled by a mouthful of Crest Whitestrips. ""They're making a lot of money. I thought dentists wanted us to have clean teeth."" Added Wenders, looking into the mirror: ""I think it's working."" According to ADA member Dr. Walter Foti, D.D.S., the national obsession with perfectly white teeth may only be getting started. ""What happens once, at long last, you people get your teeth pure white?"" Foti asked. ""Will you finally be satisfied? Of course not. Then you'll want clear teeth. You won't rest until your fucking teeth are see-through."" ""Look, you want white teeth so damn bad? It's simple,"" Jones said. ""Don't smoke, stay away from coffee, tea, and soda, brush and floss regularly, and go to your dentist every six months. Sure, have your teeth whitened occasionally, but keep in mind that we can only go far as the technology allows. When someone creates a better teeth-whitening procedure, we'll slap an 'ultra' on it and get it out on the market as fast as the FDA allows. Until then, be happy with what you have. Americans really need to learn to live with almost-total perfection."""
New Children's Book Helps Kids Deal With Pain And Isolation Of Plastic Surgery,4/16/03,3485,"MIAMI—As a pediatric plastic surgeon, Dr. Jessica Krieg changes little faces and lives for the better. Yet for all the good she does, she is all too aware that rhinoplasty and liposuction can be difficult, scary experiences for a child. With her new book, Norah's New Nose, she hopes to change all that. ""These children, on the threshold of becoming something—and someone—beautiful, are often scared and unsure of what's about to be done to them,"" Krieg said. ""In Norah's New Nose, I try to show them there's nothing to fear, and that when it's over, there's no need for shame."" As the book opens, Norah, a little girl who inherited her father's ""generous"" nose, is peering out her bedroom window at the moon. ""'Good night!' Miss Moon said to Norah,"" the book reads. ""But although the beautiful Miss Moon said good night to Norah, she said it the same way Mommy says good night to homely Miss Crabgrass or creepy old Mr. Kratch. Norah became very sad."" Norah's mother explains to her that something is preventing Miss Moon from seeing what a pretty little girl she is—something ""right in front of her face."" ""It isn't Miss Moon's fault she can't see your inner beauty,"" Mommy gently tells Norah. ""Miss Moon may be very special, but she isn't all-powerful."" Using an enchanted mirror, Mommy shows Norah the difference between her own perfect nose and her daughter's ""big, broad, bulky bird beak."" Norah starts to cry, but Mommy assures her that doctors at the hospital can solve her problem, just like they solved Mommy's. ""I wanted to show these kids that the changes they go through in the plastic-surgery ward are normal and natural,"" Krieg said. ""It's not like getting your tonsils out. It's something to make you even better instead of just barely good enough."" Norah's New Nose has already earned raves from Krieg's fellow pediatric plastic surgeons, but the reviews that matter most to Krieg are the ones from her patients. ""I love Norah's animal friends, especially Pugsley The Duckling,"" said Lacey Ginsberg, a Great Neck, NY, 7-year-old who read Krieg's book before getting the same nasal-resculpting procedure as Norah and Pugsley. ""Poor Pugsley was scared, but Norah helped her be brave. I want Daddy to get me a Pugsley doll—the one with the 'after' nose."" ""I like the part where Lissa The Thin-Lipped Butterfly changes from a butterfly into a beautiful betterfly,"" said Amanda Robles, 8, a collagen-therapy patient from Long Beach, CA. ""She'll win all the butterfly pageants now. And even though Matt R. Pillar now pays attention to her, she realizes she's way too good for him."" For all the praise Norah's New Nose has received from Krieg's colleagues, the book is not without its detractors. ""This sends a horrible message to children,"" renowned pediatrician and author Dr. T. Berry Brazelton said. ""I shouldn't have to tell anyone how damaging it is to put so much emphasis on a child's physical appearance. This is by far the worst book I've ever seen."" Krieg said she was not surprised by Brazelton's reaction. ""Of course he'd say that,"" Krieg said. ""It's just like what Miss Moon tells Norah at the end, after she comes back home with her beautiful new nose: 'My dear, now that you are as beautiful as a little girl can possibly be, all those people are just jealous.'"" ""The message isn't that being good-looking makes everything okay,"" Krieg continued. ""It just presents a whole new set of challenges—challenges these children are finally beautiful enough to face."""
Guy Eats Own Weight In Combos Over Three-Month Period,4/16/03,550,"CULLMAN, AL—In the past three months, John ""Jenko"" Quigley, 26, has casually consumed 276 pounds of pepperoni-pizza-flavored Combos snacks, an amount equal to his own body weight.

""The vet just casually asked me to bring in a sample, like I'd automatically know how to do that,"" Burkhard said. ""Do I take Sneakers for a walk and then stick a cup under him at just the right moment? Or do I, like, fasten a cup to his genitals with a belt and wait for him to eventually go?

Free Condom Harsh Reminder Of Sexless Existence,1/15/03,4916,"SANTA CRUZ, CA—A free condom served as a harsh reminder of the sexless existence Julie Tudor has endured since February 2002, the 31-year-old bookstore manager reported Tuesday. ""Uh, thanks,"" said Tudor, reluctantly accepting a LifeStyles Xtra Pleasure condom attached to a brochure containing detailed information on proper use of the prophylactic. ""But I really don't, uh, okay, thanks."" At approximately 2 p.m., while cutting across the University of California–Santa Cruz campus en route to a coffee shop, Tudor encountered a table featuring a hand-painted sign urging passersby to practice safe sex. She was immediately offered a condom by Stephanie Loughlin, a volunteer for the campus organization UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance. ""I could've told them to save it for someone who has even a remote chance of actually using it, but I still have some dignity,"" said Tudor, who hasn't needed a prophylactic since her Feb. 14, 2002 split with then-boyfriend Doug Ryback. ""God, if they only knew how little they were helping me."" Tudor said she smiled politely when Loughlin, a bubbly 20-year-old, bounded up to her and urged her to ""play it safe."" ""I didn't want to say that in the 11 months since Doug and I broke up, I really haven't been 'playing it' at all,"" Tudor said. ""Thanks for reminding me."" Tudor said she still has plenty of unused condoms at home. ""I have a box that hasn't been touched since the breakup,"" Tudor said. ""I know they're still there, because I checked for them before going out with that jerk stockbroker Michelle set me up with last month."" Tudor initially tried to avoid the safe-sex booth, pretending not to hear Safe-Sex Alliance volunteer Ryan Schumann when he shouted, ""Free condom?"" Misinterpreting Tudor's efforts to sidestep the booth as discomfort with the subject of sex, Schumann targeted her for additional education. ""Some people don't like talking about sex, which is why outreach programs like ours are so vitally important,"" said Schumann, 19. ""I told her not to be embarrassed, and that sexuality is a normal, healthy part of everyone's life.'"" ""Everyone's except mine,"" Tudor replied when told of Schumann's remarks. ""I decided to spare him that detail, though, and let him blather on about mutual respect and positive sexuality and something about a dance at the student union on the last Friday of every month."" Despite not needing protection from unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, Tudor was offered a choice of condoms by Trojan, Durex, Trustex, inSpiral, and Crown—all placed in a fishbowl along with complimentary packets of Astroglide lubricant and Wet-brand flavored lube pillows. ""When I sort of frowned at the condom in my hand, they pulled me over to pick any that I liked better from their cornucopia of condoms,"" Tudor said. ""Lubricated, non-lubricated, for-her-pleasure, for-his, mint-flavored. They even had ones wrapped in foil that looked like candy coins. Which, I hate to admit, caught my eye for a second. Chocolate, I would've had some use for."" Declining the offer of an alternate condom, Tudor grudgingly accepted a brochure containing ""fun and safe"" sex practices to try with her purely theoretical partner. She also took a printed sheet listing local health clinics that provide free testing for STDs, a brochure on the correct use of dental dams, and a photocopy of an article about female condoms—none of which remotely interested her. In the two weeks since Tudor's last major sex-related letdown—her failure to get laid on New Year's Eve despite a willingness to sleep with anyone even slightly attractive—sex had largely been relegated to the back of her mind. On Tuesday, however, Tudor was reminded of her sexless existence every time she opened her purse and saw the free condom. ""Back in college, when I was screwing with reasonable regularity, I'd actually spend time thinking about the subject [of safe sex],"" Tudor said. ""I'd worry if carrying a condom in my purse was being too forward. I'd think, is it okay to have sex with friends? What sort of stuff do I want to explore? Are threesomes safe? I had no idea that one day, my safe-sex questions would boil down to, 'Where can I get some?'"" Loughlin, who has volunteered for UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance since September, said she sees the unwillingness of some people to discuss sex as a problem facing safe-sex activists. ""Some people are, like, really weird about sex, and that totally sucks,"" said Loughlin, adjusting a ""Be On The Safe Side!"" banner. ""That's why I'm here. The more open everyone is about it, the less people will die."" ""God, I remember back when I was her age,"" Tudor said. ""I was dating this guy who lived in Arizona, but I kept cheating on him with this guy on my dorm floor: Kyle? Karl? He was a rock climber, a real outdoorsy type—kinda skinny but strong. You know, with these nice knotty muscles. I'm sorry, what was your question?"""

Nation Afraid To Admit 9-Year-Old Disabled Poet Really Bad,12/11/02,4636,"LYNDONVILLE, VT—Afflicted from birth with a rare degenerative disease, wheelchair-bound Luke Petrowski has confronted his illness by penning heartfelt verse that touches on elements vital to our lives: love, spirituality, courage, grace, and hope. His poetry has been collected in the Hopeweavings book series, all of which have been New York Times bestsellers and stand as stirring testaments to the power of faith and love. A sought-after talk-show guest and trusted friend of religious leaders and politicians alike, this home-schooled 9-year-old from small-town Vermont possesses a strength of spirit that has moved and inspired millions. Yet for all the admiration Luke has won, an unsettling, unspoken sentiment has slowly spread among the American people. Though most will scarcely dare to admit it, the consensus is that young Luke's poetry is really, really bad. ""I saw Luke on Oprah a few months ago and was amazed by his remarkable poise and courage,"" said an Oklahoma homemaker, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""But when I read his first Hopeweavings book, I couldn't deny this feeling that his poetry is actually pretty lousy. I feel horribly guilty saying so, but it's true."" The good intentions of Luke's poetry, coupled with his heartbreaking illness, make it difficult for Americans to recognize and acknowledge the poor quality of his work. The poems are fraught with saccharine sentimentality, slapdash mixed metaphors, and endless clichés involving rivers and the sun. One example from ""What's Most Important,"" a poem in his most recent book, Offering Of Hopeweavings: The things that are important in life / Are not wealth and fame / But the sun peering through the clouds / Its light shining on flower petals / And warming a kitten's nose / Making everything beautiful / Because that is what God wants / For us to be happy. ""Please don't hate me for what I'm about to say,"" said an unidentified 44-year-old male from Syracuse, NY. ""I'm not against a disabled child having a creative outlet. And I don't expect Shakespeare here. But 'flower petals'? 'Warming a kitten's nose'? It's terrible. And notice how, toward the end, he always has to shoehorn in a reference to God. Almost every single poem is like that."" In ""Breakfast Time,"" Luke likens his favorite meal of the day to spiritual redemption: Opened my eyes to the sunrise / I can smell oatmeal and toast and juice / My favorites! / The sun's rays stream through my window / Taking away the darkness / The branches that scratched against my window all night / Are warmed in the sun's heat / Wasn't I silly to ever doubt or fear? / Mom is bringing my breakfast tray up to my room / There's oatmeal and toast / And juice! / Thank you, God, for this brand-new day / Another day to weave a new tapestry of hope. The poem troubled a San Francisco bookstore employee, identified only as ""Veronica."" ""I don't consider myself some bitter, cynical crank who can't appreciate sincere sentiment,"" Veronica said. ""But the unrelenting cheerfulness is a bit much. When I read one of these Hopeweavings poems, I want to open my shirt collar and go out for air. God is always near, children are always special, and the sun is forever shining. I feel like somebody's cramming a rainbow down my throat."" While Veronica and others wrestle with their guilt, Luke's fans eagerly await the January publication of his ninth book, Grace Of Hopeweavings. ""Hopeweavings books belong on every bookshelf in America,"" said Lubbock, TX, realtor Mary Ellen Buford. ""Almost all my friends and colleagues have copies of Luke's books, and I highly recommend them to anyone. Luke is a living saint. I don't claim to get everything he writes, but that's how incredible this boy is. He has things to teach us that will take most of us a lifetime to understand."" This past April, Nicholas Farmer, 37, a technical-support specialist for a Boston telecommunications firm, attended a motivational seminar which featured Luke as a guest speaker. ""His poem about a conversation with an angel moved a lot of us to tears,"" Farmer said. ""Watching that frail, brave little boy recite his poetry to a rapt audience is something I won't soon forget."" Moved by the experience, Farmer bought Luke's fifth book, Hopeweavings: Heaven's Just A Hug Away. Yet halfway through the book, even Farmer began to question its artistic merit. ""As I'm reading one of the poems—I think it was 'Another Shiny Day'—I'm thinking, can't Luke just draw pictures for his fridge?"" Farmer said. ""Or, better yet, not do anything artistic or spiritual at all, and just play video games? Am I just being a huge asshole? Probably."""

Republicans Mount Campaign To Rename Alzheimer's 'Reagan's Disease',11/06/02,4355,"WASHINGTON, DC—Seeking to honor the former president and longtime Alzheimer's sufferer, congressional Republicans have mounted a campaign to rename Alzheimer's ""Reagan's Disease."" ""No one is more strongly associated with this degenerative brain disease than Ronald Reagan, the man who restored pride to America and singlehandedly ended the Cold War,"" said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, speaking before the House Tuesday. ""For all he has given this country, this is the least we can give back."" Armey, co-sponsor of HR 3461, the Reagan's Disease Renaming Bill, is backed by the American Ronald Reagan Recognition Group (ARRRG), a coalition of citizens and business leaders who have championed the cause for more than five years. ""Approximately four million Americans are afflicted with Alzheimer's, and another 37 million know someone suffering from it,"" said Armey, reading a statement prepared by ARRRG. ""To put the name of this great leader on the tips of all these tongues would be a fitting tribute, indeed."" Republicans have already honored Reagan by naming or renaming hundreds of public works—including highways, libraries, parks, hospitals, and federal buildings—after him. In 1998, Washington National Airport was renamed Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The following year, construction was completed on the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center, the largest government building in Washington. ""When someone drives past the Ronald W. Reagan Federal Courthouse in Santa Ana or Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio, they are reminded of the contributions of this great man,"" ARRRG spokesman James Andrusko said. ""How fitting it would be to name this disease after Reagan, who has so valiantly battled it since the early 1980s."" Armey and other GOP lawmakers hope to change the disease's name in time for Reagan's 92nd birthday on Feb. 6, 2003. ""Just as Lou Gehrig's Disease calls to mind the Iron Horse and his legendary achievements on the baseball field, Reagan's Disease will remind Americans of the Great Communicator and his countless achievements in the field of politics,"" U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) said. ""I can't think of an Alzheimer's sufferer more richly deserving of this honor than one of the greatest presidents of all time, Mr. Ronald Wilson Reagan."" ""President Reagan may not be capable of understanding this honor,"" Lugar continued, ""but we owe it to him nonetheless."" In 1995, Reagan revealed his fight with Alzheimer's in a letter to the American people, then retired from public life to privately battle the illness. ""Though Reagan first disclosed that he had Alzheimer's in 1995, it's clear that he suffered the onset of the disease long before then,"" said Dr. Jim Hollis, the president's personal physician. ""There is no test to diagnose Alzheimer's in its early stages, so symptoms like memory loss and confusion are often wrongly attributed to normal aging. Obviously, this was the case with Reagan, judging by his behavior during the Iran-Contra hearings."" Hollis said that early symptoms of Alzheimer's, including repetition of statements and mild disorientation, are often subtle. Advanced symptoms, however, are more pronounced, including inability to recall recent major life events, delusions, depression, agitation, hallucinations, belligerence, and violent behavior. ""Reagan,"" Hollis said. ""Definitely Reagan."" According to Alzheimer's Association president Diane Watros, though the name change may result in temporary inconvenience, the group fully supports it. ""This can only help raise awareness, which will, in turn, lead to increases in federal research funding to find a cure,"" Watros said. ""Some may see it as unnecessary and pandering, even a slap in the face to Alois Alzheimer, the scientist who discovered the disease in 1906, but he's dead and long forgotten, unlike The Gipper."" Watros also hopes the renaming will result in improvements in quality of care for those who suffer from the disease. ""As it is, health-care workers look at an Alzheimer's sufferer and only see someone who can no longer perform such basic functions as eating, dressing, and bathing, someone who spends most of his or her day babbling nonsensically or just staring off blankly into the distance,"" Watros said. ""But in the future, they will look at this same person and be reminded of Ronald Reagan."""
"Daytime-Talk-Show Mixup Leads To 1,000-Pound- Man Makeover",10/30/02,631,"NEW YORK—In a mix-up Ricki Lake producers called ""deeply regrettable,"" 1,000-pound Willard Hoskins, 37, was removed from his Paramus, NJ, home by forklift and transported to the posh Richard Stein Salon on Madison Avenue for a thorough beauty makeover Monday. ""Let's see Willard's stunning new look!"" Lake told the studio audience as Hoskins was wheeled out in a sequined black garment made from two king-size bed sheets to the accompaniment of throbbing disco music. ""Wow, you look great!"" The episode is believed to be daytime television's worst mix-up since Maury Povich sent a group of disfigured children to boot camp in 1999."
Starving Third World Masses Warned Against Evils Of Contraception,10/09/02,4111,"SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL—During a visit to the teeming slums of São Paulo Monday, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua warned the city's starving masses against the evils of contraception, urging them to ""be fruitful and multiply"" and do ""everything in [their] power"" to resist the mortal sin of birth control. ""In Genesis, God commands us to be fruitful and multiply, to fill the Earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish and birds and every other living thing,"" said Bevilacqua, speaking before more than 200,000 malnourished São Paulo slum dwellers. ""It is not for man to decide whether the world should have more babies than it can reasonably support. God will decide whose seed shall find purchase and when."" The gathering, which took place on a muddy hillside crowded with tin-and-tarpaper shacks, was one of many to take place around the world Monday—a day Pope John Paul II declared World Childbirth Day. ""No wonder we are plagued by disease and high infant mortality,"" said São Paulo father of eight Oranjinho Cruz, speaking from his dilapidated one-room home, which lacks electricity or potable water. ""God has been punishing us for trying to prevent the miraculous gift of conception."" In Calcutta, a city where 53 percent of residents are under 18, Catholic missionaries delivered a similar message of love and procreation. ""In this life, there is a right path and a wrong path, and which you take is entirely up to you,"" said missionary Christopher Halloran, addressing a group of 4,500 villagers crammed into a schoolhouse. ""Will you deny God's wisdom by using condoms, or will you shine in the divine light of unprotected sex? The choice is clear."" ""God does not want you to choke the rivers of fertile bounty with immoral birth-control pills,"" continued Halloran, framed by a backdrop of brown, withered crops and skeletal, half-living farm animals. ""He wants you to continue expanding your families. If your babies starve, Jesus will forgive them."" The words of Halloran and his fellow missionaries have struck a chord with the impoverished masses of the world. ""We were told we should not use condoms to prevent the spread of HIV,"" said Luis Ortiz of Bogotá, Colombia. ""The man from the Church assured us that the Lord will protect us from disease, provided we are true to His wish that we produce more children than we can possibly care for."" Added Ortiz: ""Life in this shantytown is difficult, but our troubles are nothing compared to what we will face in the Lake Of Fire if we try to live within our means and regulate the number of offspring we produce, as Satan teaches."" Though critics have called the Catholic Church's anti-contraception campaign irresponsible and dangerous, particularly in regions where food and medical facilities are scarce, the missionaries remain steadfast in their commitment to fighting the spread of birth control. ""No man-made organization knows God's will,"" said Atlanta-born missionary Lucas Roberts, 24, handing out Bibles to polio-stricken children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. ""His ways are mysterious and noble. All we can do is interpret His words as they appear in the Good Book. And those words clearly state that we have an obligation to shun effective methods of population control."" Responding to critics, Cardinal Bevilacqua said the Catholic Church is not oblivious to the plight of the impoverished, noting that it offers a sanctioned way to postpone the inevitable fruit of God's will. ""For those who want to practice God's natural birth control, there are two options,"" Bevilacqua said. ""You can try abstinence or, if you are married, you can try natural family planning, also known as the rhythm method. This has proven up to 87 percent effective, which is more than suitable for maintaining a reasonable household. So long as no seed is spilled, God will not immediately strike you down."" Bevilacqua also noted that, in cases in which natural family planning fails, unwanted children can be sent to Catholic orphanages, where they will be cared for and groomed to spread word of the punishment awaiting those who impede God's grand biological destiny."
Zombie Nutritionist Recommends All-Brain Diet,9/26/02,3324,"STONY BROOK, NY—In a dramatic reversal of decades-old medical wisdom, the late Dr. Albert Rossum, director of the O'Bannon Institute For Postmortem Nutritional Studies, recommended an all-brain diet for zombies Tuesday. ""Our research indicates that live human brains are not merely the cornerstone of a healthy diet; they are, in fact, the only food an active adult zombie should consume at all,"" Rossum said during a press conference at the institute, located at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. ""A daily three-pound serving of brains supplies all the vital sugars, neurons, and ganglia essential to promoting zombie fitness and slowing the decomposition process."" The Rossum Plan challenges the traditional zombie food pyramid, which consists of five to seven daily servings of human hearts, three to four servings of livers or eyeballs, and two servings of brains. Instead, Rossum advocates a four-level pyramid, with all four levels consisting of as many servings of brains as possible. ""Ideally, the brains should be consumed fresh from the head of the victim,"" said Rossum, widely considered the nation's leading expert in the field of undead nutrition. ""However, precious scraps of brain may also be pried from the fingers of other brain-crazed zombies. Failing that, dropped brains may be slurped from the ground by a third party to such a scuffle."" Added Rossum: ""Braaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnns!"" Nutritionists at the Romero Foundation For Zombie Health, the nation's oldest zombie-health organization, were dismissive of Rossum's announcement. ""The O'Bannon Institute's plan is a reckless fad diet,"" the late Dr. Vincent Peters said. ""Five servings each day from the neurosensory group, made up of the brain, spinal column, and nervous system, as well as from the vascular, digestive, and pulmonary groups, are the best way to maintain robust zombie health. It is an established fact."" Told of Peters' remarks, Rossum strenuously disagreed, citing recent tests conducted by his institute. ""Studies have shown that zombies who follow the Romero school of nutrition can be stopped with a single bullet to the brainstem,"" Rossum said. ""On the other hand, our exhaustive studies conclusively show that the newer, fitter breed of zombies who adhere to an all-brain diet cannot be subdued by anything short of total incineration."" Rossum's detractors are quick to point out that a high percentage of zombies in his studies are young accidental-death victims, many still in their teens, recruited from the punk-rock-fan community. Such individuals, critics charge, are too healthy and recently deceased to be reliable subjects in long-term dietary studies. Critics also charge that a diet consisting entirely of brains would not be likely to attract many followers due to its monotonous nature. Rossum again disagreed. ""There is still ample room for dietary variety in this plan,"" Rossum said. ""One day, you might make a spicy South Of The Border treat of a Mexican person's brains. The next, you could enjoy the Far East taste sensation of an Asian. There are so many different kinds of heads to tear open, there's no reason ever to get bored."" Rossum then stepped down from the podium and descended upon New York Times photographer Dennis Levitan, cracking his skull open and devouring his brains."
8-Year-Old Can't Understand Why He Isn't Allowed On Roof,9/11/02,3509,"STERLING HEIGHTS, MI—No amount of explanation has been sufficient to make Dylan Rieder, 8, understand why he is not permitted on the roof of his family's two-story home. ""I don't know why I can't play up there,"" Rieder said Monday. ""I'm not gonna fall off. It's way less steep than the slide at the playground. And I never fall off that when I climb up. Plus, I wouldn't ruin anything—there's not even anything to ruin. It's just the roof and the chimney and the TV antenna and the wires that go to the telephone pole, but I know not to touch the wires."" Rieder's remarks came on the heels of his third parental warning in as many weeks not to even think about going on the roof. ""He does this every summer,"" said Beth Rieder, Dylan's mother. ""As soon as it gets warm, he gets it in his head that he needs to get on that roof, and he won't give up until it's covered with snow. If I hadn't been out shopping all afternoon, he would have bugged me about it again today."" While Rieder has been subjected to numerous anti-roof-climbing lectures from his parents, his older brother Stephen, and next-door neighbor Mr. Rutigliano, none of their arguments have struck him as valid. Reasons given for staying off the roof have included the danger of falling off, the fragility of the shingles, and what someone driving by might think. ""He knows he shouldn't be up there,"" Beth said. ""That's that."" Rieder said he recognizes that safety is a concern and promised he would not run, jump, or otherwise conduct himself irresponsibly if let onto the roof. ""I would be really, really careful,"" Rieder said. ""It's not that different from climbing a tree. Mom once said she was going to let me put a treehouse up there. What's the difference?"" Rieder said he could perform many useful tasks if permitted onto the roof. ""I could see if any balls got caught up there and throw them down. And I could make sure the chimney doesn't have anything stuck in it,"" Rieder said. ""Also, I could help get the leaves out of the leavesdrops [sic], then Dad wouldn't have to get all mad at the ladder when it pinches his fingers."" As further evidence that his parents have nothing to fear, Rieder cited several eye-opening statistics. ""People can get killed in a car accident a hundred times more easy than they can on a roof,"" Rieder said. ""Or they can eat poison by accident or get a disease or get bit by a dog and get rabies. So I should get to go on the roof, 'cause it would be a lot safer than that."" Though he would like his parents' permission, Rieder said he has not ruled out a covert roof visit. Without use of his parents' bedroom window, which they keep locked at all times, Rieder's best chance for roof access is via a tree in the backyard. By climbing to the fourth extending branch, Rieder would be able to drop down neatly onto the roof. The tree, however, is visible to anyone looking out the kitchen window, the very place where his mother stands as she does dishes and prepares meals. ""I might try the tree in the back, too, but that's harder,"" Rieder said. ""I can't get caught, 'cause Mom would kill me."" Climbing on the roof is not the only activity forbidden to Rieder. Also verboten are pulling up the loose blacktop at the edge of the driveway, picking leaves off the bushes in the front yard, playing with the rocks in the window wells, writing on the side of the house with chalk, climbing on the water meter, putting anything in the mailbox without prior approval, and opening the chest freezer in the garage."
U.S. Fast-Food Chains Agree To Voluntary Cheese Limits,9/04/02,3363,"OAK PARK, IL—Fearful of the prospect of class-action lawsuits, seven of the nation's largest fast-food chains voluntarily agreed Monday to place cheese limits on their own sandwich items. ""With Americans becoming increasingly health-conscious and litigious, the restaurant industry felt it necessary to protect itself with a self-imposed cheese cap,"" said Paul Conklin, president of the National Association of Fast-Food Retailers. ""Gone are the days when we could load a burger with seven slices of fatty, cholesterol-laden American cheese without fear of reprisal."" Effective Oct. 1, McDonald's, Burger King, and five other leading chains will institute the ""three-ounce rule,"" limiting the amount of cheese per sandwich item to three ounces. Though still double the USDA's recommended daily limit for cheese, the three-ounce limit is expected to sharply reduce the health risk posed to regular customers. ""This is us stepping up and taking responsibility for the health of our valued customers,"" Wendy's vice-president Bernard Angell said. ""It's the right thing to do."" Most of the major fast-food chains have embraced the self-imposed limits, calling them ""a small price to pay."" ""From now on, anyone who wants extra cheese will have to sign a waiver clearing us of any and all culpability for health problems incurred as a result of excess cheese consumption,"" Burger King CEO Henry Tarment said. ""The reality is, if we continued the way we were going, it was only a matter of time before that BK Triple Cheddar Stack caught up to us big-time. Three juicy beef patties and four big cheddar slices wasn't just a recipe for a great burger—it was a recipe for disaster."" One burger chain that has refused to participate in the cheese restrictions is Hardee's. ""The integrity of our Monster Burger would be severely compromised by these limitations,"" Hardee's president Andrew Puzder said. ""To have only three slices of cheese would mean we could not credibly call this product a Monster Burger. Although we applaud these other chains for their good intentions, our number-one priority is providing our customers with the kind of delicious burgers they have come to expect and deserve. And cheese, healthy or not, is an essential component of that deliciousness."" Another powerful dissenting voice has been that of Arby's. ""The [NAFFR] proposal has its merits,"" said Boyd Shumacher, Arby's vice-president for product development and creator of the Arby's Big Cheddar roast-beef sandwich. ""However, when we found that the limits included both natural cheese and imitation-and-natural cheese alloys, we felt we had to decline."" ""Nobody wants to be sued out of existence by the family of some overweight guy whose heart exploded,"" Shumacher added, ""but at some point, you have to draw the line."" Though health experts applaud the unprecedented self-policing measure, they say more needs to be done. ""Decreasing the amount of cheese is certainly a good start,"" said Dr. Steven Gregory, director of the NYU Medical Center's obesity-studies program. ""But even without cheese, these greasy fast-food burgers, when eaten every day, are going to cause significant health problems. Ultimately, the burger chains don't care about their customers' health. They're primarily looking to protect themselves from lazy, fat fucks who'll eat anything between two halves of a bun."""

Nation To Be Tested For Scoliosis Friday,7/24/02,4686,"WASHINGTON, DC—In a mandatory, nationwide health initiative many Americans are dreading, all U.S. citizens will be tested for scoliosis Friday. ""Though some people may think it's a laughing matter, scoliosis is no joke,"" said Dr. David Krasnow of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is overseeing the testing. ""An untreated case will result in significant deformity of the spine. So we can either act like mature ladies and gentlemen and get through the screenings quickly, or goof off and make it harder for everyone."" The scoliosis checks, to be conducted in junior-high-school gymnasiums across the U.S., are intended to diagnose and prevent the degenerative condition, which produces an S- or C-shaped curvature in the spine. During the 30-second procedure, citizens will bend forward roughly 25 degrees while federal health workers look for any abnormal distension, such as a bulging rib or fullness in the lumbar area. If a citizen tests positive for scoliosis, he or she will be fitted for a custom brace designed to halt the progression of the curvature. Americans of both sexes will be asked to disrobe to the waist. Women will be permitted to keep their bras on. Krasnow stressed that the screenings are mandatory, and that every American is expected to show up at his or her designated auditorium. ""If you're sick or otherwise unavailable on Thursday, we'll be contacting you to reschedule,"" Krasnow said. ""We'll also be on the lookout for forged parental notes excusing people from the test."" Though Dallas resident Julie Muldowney, 42, plans to comply, she questioned the screenings' necessity. ""I don't get it,"" Muldowney said. ""I remember getting tested for scoliosis back in seventh or eighth grade. We had to step behind a screen in the girls' locker room, and the school nurse examined our backs for curvatures. It was incredibly unpleasant and embarrassing. Why do they need to check us again?"" Also skeptical is Baltimore resident Eddie Woodson. Fitted with a cervico-thoraco-lumbo-sacral-orthosis brace after being diagnosed with scoliosis during the last nationwide screening in 1999, the 51-year-old landscaper said his range of motion has been severely restricted ever since. ""The doctor told me to wear this thing 23 hours a day, and I can only take it off to swim or play,"" said Woodson, his head held upright by a neck ring anchored to the plastic, custom-molded device. ""When I asked him if I could take it off to work, he said no. This is ridiculous. I probably lived with this condition for years, and it never bothered me. You try lifting rolls of sod with this damn thing on."" Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson rejected such criticisms, insisting that the benefits of scoliosis screening far outweigh the inconvenience. ""I assure you, the government is not doing this just to be meanies,"" Thompson said. ""As Americans get older and look back on these screenings, I am confident they'll come to understand just how important they really were. That goes for all of our programs."" Thompson was alluding to such unpopular HHS programs as the annual mandatory head-lice inspection, the hearing test, and ""Friday the Thir-teeth,"" a dental-hygiene fair at which HHS officials dress in foam molar costumes to distribute toothbrushes and small red tablets which, when chewed, expose plaque on the teeth. Thompson said he believes a majority of Americans view the scoliosis test favorably, citing the example of Verona, WI, resident Alan Righetti. ""The scoliosis test is awesome,"" said Righetti, 35. ""The last one was held in the school cafeteria, and there were partitions between the men and the women. But if you looked between the partitions, you could see the ladies in their bras."" Continued Righetti: ""The Scoliosis Man comic book they gave out was pretty lame, but at least it wasn't as dumb as that one we got from the suicide-awareness and prevention assembly. Me and my buddies down at the lumber yard still quote it, it's so stupid: 'Chad, do you want my portable cassette player? I don't want it anymore.' 'But, Ben, I don't get it. That's your most prized possession!' Yeah, we get it—suicidal people give their stuff away! How dumb is that?"" The next mandatory HHS initiative is slated for October. Titled ""It's Perfectly Natural,"" the program will address the topic of menstruation. ""We'll be giving out free Kotex sanitary napkins and tampons, and showing the 1973 film Donna, You're Not Alone,"" Krasnow said. ""And if you men out there think you're exempt from attending, think again. We'll be holding a concurrent, men-only talk about what to expect from puberty. And let's refrain from the giggling, shall we?"""
Area Man Thinking About Getting One Of Those All-Body Scans,6/19/02,398,"AUGUSTA, GA—Impressed by the technology, Dan Cirillo is thinking about getting an all-body imaging scan, the 45-year-old Augusta man revealed Monday.

""Man, this really isn't anything like the movie,"" said Garrity, 54, watching the interior of his large intestine on a video monitor. ""This voyage is decidedly non-fantastic.""

Man Blames Hangover On Everything But How Much He Drank,5/29/02,3798,"BETHEL PARK, PA—Speaking slowly and moving stiffly Tuesday, Pittsburgh-area resident Matt Van Duyne attributed his hangover to everything but the excessive amount of alcohol he'd consumed the previous night. ""One big problem was the empty stomach,"" said Van Duyne, holding his head and taking deep breaths. ""I really should know by now to make sure to eat a piece of pizza or some french fries or something before doing any drinking. That kind of greasy, high-carb stuff works best, I find, because it really soaks up the alcohol. Another thing I neglected to do was drink a lot of water. That's key. Also, I forgot to take my usual two aspirins before going to bed, which helps a lot."" ""There's a real art to not getting a hangover,"" Van Duyne added. A web designer for Altered Images, the 28-year-old Van Duyne had spent the evening watching DVDs at the home of friend Kenny Layton. Between 10:30 p.m. and 2 a.m., Van Duyne consumed three-quarters of a jug of Gallo wine he found in Layton's kitchen cabinet. Shortly after 2 a.m., he stumbled seven blocks back to his apartment. ""This happens every time I drink Gallo, especially red,"" Van Duyne said. ""That stuff really gives me a hangover. It probably has something to do with all the sulfites they use."" Though Van Duyne describes himself as a social drinker, coworkers say he frequently arrives at work asking them to ""take it easy on [him]"" because of a hangover he attributes to everything but excessive drinking. ""My favorite is when he explains that he forgot to follow the 'beer before liquor, never sicker' rule,"" coworker Thomas Juno said. ""Sorry, Matty, but when you're pounding six of each in just over three hours, I don't think it really matters what order you drink them in."" ""Last Thursday, we all went out to Pitchers Pub to celebrate landing this huge St. Francis Medical Center account,"" said Heather Hagerty, 25, a tech writer at Altered Images. ""Over the course of the next four hours, Matt drank six Iron Citys, three Cuervo shots, and a Jack and Coke. The next morning at work, he's complaining that he feels woozy because he didn't take his Vitamin B before drinking. I have this alternate theory that he felt woozy because he drank six Iron Citys, three Cuervo shots, and a Jack and Coke."" Even when owning up to drinking excessively, Van Duyne still finds ways to attribute his hungover state to other factors. ""Last year, me and three of my buddies did a whole bottle of mescal on my birthday. We got to the bottom, and I got the worm,"" Van Duyne said. ""That messed me up bad the next day, because the worm absorbs a lot of alcohol. It's almost like a hallucinogen. I ruined my favorite comforter because I puked all over it. Stupid worm."" Longtime friend Pete Sirois, 27, heard a new excuse last Friday night, when he and Van Duyne went drinking at Anchor Inn. ""Matt was doing all these different shots—Stoli, Jack Daniels, Jägermeister—you name it,"" Sirois said. ""He was really wasted. I talked to him the next night, and he was complaining about how he still had a headache, because he 'failed to stay consistent [with his liquors].' I'm like, 'Yeah, if only you'd done vodka shots all night, you would've been fine.'"" ""The amazing thing is, he hardly ever uses the same excuse twice,"" Sirois continued. ""One time, it might be 'I stupidly combined champagne with hard lemonade,' and the next, 'I should've known better than to mix liquor with diet soda.' He must devote more time to researching hangovers than he does to his job."" Despite his wicked hangover, Van Duyne plans to spend this evening drinking at a local nightclub. ""I'm still feeling kinda shitty, but I can't miss 2-for-1 apple-martini night at Insomnia,"" Van Duyne said. ""So long as I take two tablespoons of olive oil beforehand, I should be fine."""
Area Man Urinating Like It's The Best Thing Ever To Happen To Him,5/22/02,518,"FALL RIVER, MA— According to fellow urinators in the men's room of the Tip-Top Tavern, Steve Rilke, 44, is urinating as if it were the best thing ever to happen to him.

U.S. Children Getting Majority Of Antibiotics From McDonald's Meat,4/17/02,4450,"WASHINGTON, DC—According to a Department of Health and Human Services report released Monday, McDonald’s meat from antibiotics-injected livestock is now the primary source of antibiotics for U.S. children, particularly for uninsured youths from low-income households. “Unfortunately, some children still fall through the cracks in our health-care system, but luckily, McDonald’s is there to lend a helping hand,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said at a press conference announcing the findings. “So even if a child’s family has no health insurance and can’t afford medicine, virtually anyone can afford a delicious 99-cent Big Mac with pickles, cheese, and a heapin’ helpin’ of [the antibiotic] quinupristin-dalfopristin.” In HHS tests, 82 percent of children who had not been properly inoculated were still found to have significant levels of antibiotics in their bloodstreams. The antibiotics, the tests concluded, were the result of sustained intake of McDonald’s meat. “Disadvantaged children tend to eat at McDonald’s a lot, which is a good thing,” Thompson said. “If you think about it, where else are these kids going to get their fluoroquinolone?” Large-scale meat producers, Thompson noted, routinely add antibiotics to the feed of healthy animals to prevent cross-infection in the crowded, cramped quarters where livestock are typically raised. In the U.S., the average beef steer receives eight times more antibiotics than its human counterpart. “When your daughter gets strep throat, head straight over to McDonald’s and prescribe her a delicious Quarter Pounder or nine-piece Chicken McNuggets,” Thompson said. “She’ll not only receive the amoxycillin she needs to get better, but also a whole array of growth hormones proven to speed a child’s physical development.” “And if your child prefers Burger King or Wendy’s,” he continued, “that’s fine, too. Any of the big fast-food chains can get them healthy.” While all Americans benefit from the 25 million pounds of antibiotics fed to chickens, pigs, and cows each year, children stand to gain the most, U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) said. “Children weigh less than adults, so when they eat a hamburger, they get a proportionally more potent dose of antibiotics,” said Lugar, who is among the Senate’s strongest proponents of fast-food-based health care. “These antibiotics are vital in the treatment of such common childhood ailments as sore throat, ear infection, and hoof rot.” According to Lugar, waiting in a crowded doctor’s office may soon be a thing of the past. “Every day, food scientists are discovering new antibiotics, growth hormones, and other chemically engineered substances to inject into the nation’s beef supply,” Lugar said. “And with Americans working longer and longer hours just to make ends meet, people can’t afford to waste time sitting around some waiting room until their name is called. Unlike a doctor, our fast-food providers can deliver a full spectrum of antibiotics in minutes—hot, fresh, and with a smile.” In conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services, Burger King will soon release a brochure, “Happy And Healthy The Burger King Way,” which outlines a 14-day plan for the treatment of bacterial infections. In the leaflet, a cartoon cow in a medical coat reminds parents to give their infected children two daily doses of antibiotic-treated meat for 14 days. If the condition does not improve after 10 days, the parent or guardian of the ailing child is instructed to contact a store manager. “If your child has a sinus infection, he or she can drop by before and after school for a Double Cheeseburger 50cc Meal or a delicious Chicken Tetracycline,” Burger King spokeswoman Linda Jacobs said. “As we’re fond of saying here at Burger King, ‘This won’t hurt a bite!’” Though representatives say they’re pleased with the praise it has received, the fast-food industry does not intend to rest on its laurels. “Repeated use of antibiotics will result in increased resistance to antibiotics in new strains of bacteria,” said Carl Pickney, lab researcher for TriCon Global, the fast-food conglomerate that owns KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. “That’s why we need to encourage our meat suppliers to continually raise the levels of antibiotics in their meat, developing newer, stronger antibiotics to replace those that no longer work. We’re making good progress, but we’ve still got a whole lot of meat to modify.”"

Monsanto, makers of the vegetable, stressed that genetic-modification technology is still in its infancy, and that more pleasantly voiced broccoli should hit store shelves by 2003."
March Named Breast Cancer Obliviousness Month,2/27/02,2877,"SAN FRANCISCO—The National Breast Cancer Obliviousness Foundation is gearing up for Breast Cancer Obliviousness Month, to be observed across the U.S. throughout the month of March. ""Each year in this country, more than 40 million Americans don't really think about breast cancer all that much,"" said National Breast Cancer Obliviousness Foundation director Judith Quinn at a press conference kicking off the month-long event. ""These people get up each day and go to work without this dread disease ever crossing their minds."" Founded in 1997, the National Breast Cancer Obliviousness Foundation is one of the nation's fastest-growing charitable organizations. As a result of the group's work, more than 120 million citizens are not aware of the serious threat breast cancer poses or the simple steps women can take to detect and prevent the disease early. Planned events include marches dedicated to various breast-cancer-unrelated items, including anteaters and motel-lobby vending machines; free cajun-cooking demonstrations; and the distribution of red ribbons to put people's minds on AIDS instead. ""We've come far in our short history, but much work lies ahead,"" Quinn said. ""For example, we're about to produce a pamphlet with basic information on the disease and a list of breast-cancer research organizations to which people can donate money. Then we will leave those pamphlets sitting in some warehouse somewhere in Iowa, just collecting dust."" Among the topics Americans will not learn more about during Breast Cancer Obliviousness Month are the importance of regular mammograms for women over 40, how to conduct an at-home self breast exam, and simple diet and lifestyle tips to help reduce the risk of getting the disease. ""It's vital that we focus our energies on something other than the 190,000 new cases of breast cancer in the U.S. each year,"" Quinn said. ""Because if we don't, we're all going to get pretty bummed out."" Television networks have joined forces with the Breast Cancer Obliviousness Foundation in support of its cause. Throughout March, CBS will air public-service announcements featuring Ray Romano delivering the slogan, ""Breast Cancer: Fuhgeddaboutit!"" On March 28, NBC will air a ""very routine episode"" of Friends in which none of the female characters are diagnosed with, or even mention, breast cancer. The episode will conclude with a phone number viewers may call to hear that evening's sports scores. ""Volunteers and donations are still badly needed if we as a nation are going to continue to be unaware of this dreaded killer,"" Quinn said. ""For those who have already heard about breast cancer, it may be too late, but at least we can distract them to help ease their awareness while working to ensure that our daughters, and our daughters' daughters, never know much about this terrible condition."" Added Quinn: ""Let's play badminton."""
Man Dies After Long And Painful Battle With Life,11/28/01,3182,"LEWISTOWN, MT—Gerald Carruthers, a retired insurance agent and father of three, died Monday at 77 following a long and painful battle with life. ""Thank God it's finally over,"" said Maria Heupel, 53, his eldest daughter. ""He was in such terrible pain those last 70 or so years. You could just see it eating away at him from within. By the end, he was just a hollow, wasted shell."" ""The agony for him had been overwhelming since about 1930,"" Heupel added. ""It's amazing he lasted as long as he did."" Carruthers, once a happy and vital toddler, had his first painful episode shortly after his fourth birthday, when his father beat him with a cane for accidentally urinating on a favorite rug. Other such episodes occurred with regularity throughout Carruthers' life. An awkward adolescence was followed by a middling stint at the University of Montana. After years of woefully few dates, Carruthers' disease went into brief remission in 1948, when he met and courted Joyce Lowell during a leave of absence from the Air Force. His suffering returned, however, when he was forced to quickly marry Lowell after she became pregnant with his child. Carruthers resigned from the Air Force and, from that point on, the erosion of his spirit accelerated. His personal growth badly stunted, Carruthers shelved his dreams of becoming a pilot and instead became an insurance agent. Unfortunately, his meager salary meant that he would be unable to afford relief in the form of material comforts or vacations. By the time Carruthers reached his 40s, he found himself so crippled, he could only lie on his sofa and watch TV after work. ""He tried to be brave,"" said wife Joyce Carruthers, who watched Gerald's struggle with life transform him from a moody 30-year-old insurance agent into a deeply bitter, borderline-alcoholic 60-year-old insurance agent. ""But it's not easy. His pain made it impossible for him to enjoy our wedding day, the birth of his children, even a normal weekend with his family. You can't imagine what the ordeal was like for him."" According to his personal physician, Dr. Clement Kirschwasser, Carruthers' search for a cure followed a pattern common among those afflicted with life. ""He tried just about every form of treatment: diet, exercise, rest, therapy, the usual array of drugs and alcohol—you name it,"" Kirschwasser said. ""But he didn't respond to any of them. Occasionally, there would be a slight reduction in symptoms, but inevitably, hopelessness and demoralization would always set in again."" Toward the end, Carruthers was exhausted and drained of the will to fight. Family members say that even if he had made the effort, he was too far gone to be saved. ""He might have tried some Eastern techniques or the more exotic pharmacological approaches, but the wasting ravages of life had already done their damage,"" said son Daniel Carruthers, 49, who with his three disappointing children, failed marriage, and exorbitant alimony payments, is already in the advanced stages of the syndrome that claimed his father's life. ""I just hope that when my turn comes, I go peacefully in my sleep like Dad,"" Daniel continued. ""Come to think of it, the sooner the better."""
"6,000 Runners Fail To Discover Cure For Breast Cancer",11/14/01,2976,"ATLANTA—Despite their diligent, dedicated running, the 6,000-plus participants in Sunday's 5K Race For The Cure did not find a cure for breast cancer. Hopes were high, given the excellent weather and record turnout for the 11th annual event, but no viable cure for the disease was discovered along the 3.1-mile course. ""We were particularly hopeful of locating the cure somewhere around the two-and-a-half-mile mark,"" race organizer Jill Broadbent said. ""At that point, the route goes right past Northside Hospital and within a block of several Emory University oncology facilities. That seemed the most promising place to perhaps spot a breast-cancer cure. Regrettably, the runners were unable to do more than momentarily glimpse in researchers' windows as they passed by."" At 10 a.m., participants gathered outside the Georgia Dome and proceeded to search through much of downtown Atlanta, including a one-mile stretch of Peachtree Road, before finishing cureless at the state capitol. Among those disappointed by Sunday's failed attempt was Gene Worth, a Germantown, TN, real-estate agent who drove 450 miles to participate in his seventh Race For The Cure. ""I worked out for three months, focusing my full energies on preparing for this race,"" Worth said. ""I switched to a vegan macrobiotic diet just to be in top shape. Three kilometers in, I felt great, like this was going to be the year we cured it. I did break my personal 5K record, but even that wasn't enough. Then, after I crossed the finish line, I watched other racers finish, but they came in empty-handed, as well."" Broadbent was quick to dispute characterizations of the run as a failure. ""As we like to say, today brought us one 5K run closer to the cure,"" Broadbent said. ""We may not have cured it yet, but one of these times, we will. When faced with a setback like this, we need to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and run another five kilometers."" Added Broadbent: ""If even one patient went into remission as a result of thousands of people running around Atlanta, then it's all worth it."" The race was the latest disappointment in a dismal two-week stretch for athletic-based medical research. On Nov. 1 in Dallas, an estimated 3,000 cyclists were unable to isolate the portion of the human genome responsible for Alzheimer's disease. Three days later in Boston, some 200 rowers from 27 different colleges gathered on the Charles River in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate AIDS. And a pair of Nov. 9 regattas in San Diego and Miami failed to cure cystic fibrosis and heart disease, respectively. Runs against cancer and other diseases have been popular since 1976, when Olympic runner Bill Rodgers discovered the formula for Interferon Beta—effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis—at the base of Nobska Point Lighthouse while running the Falmouth (MA) Road Race. Rodgers went on to win the Nobel Prize For Medicine for his discovery, despite losing the race itself to Alberto Salazar."

Man Has Mixed Feelings About Having Disease Named After Him,8/29/01,3048,"CHICOPEE, MA—In the three years since Dominic Quinn was diagnosed with a previously undetected gastrointestinal disorder, he's become a household name. Yet, for all his notoriety, the 44-year-old Chicopee claims adjuster remains ambivalent about being the Quinn behind Quinn's Disease. ""I suppose it's an honor,"" Quinn told reporters Monday. ""I mean, how many people get something named after them? Then again, it'd be nice if I could have somehow gotten the notoriety without having to suffer from a disease."" Quinn's Disease, believed to afflict one in every two million Americans, is a non-fatal genetic disorder that impairs the parts of the brain that control alimentary and digestive functions. Symptoms include severe gastrointestinal distress, esophageal inflammation, and constipation and gaseousness. In certain cases, a narrowing of the colon and extreme impacting of the bowels can result, with the pressure becoming so great that a violent hemorrhage of blood and fecal matter occurs. Quinn's ailment makes it necessary for him to submit to round-the-clock medical surveillance and a grueling regimen of thrice-daily enemas and anti-constipation drugs. In addition, since his March 1999 diagnosis, Quinn has undergone 11 operations to clear his large intestine of densely packed, highly toxic waste matter. Given the choice, Quinn would prefer to derive fame from other aspects of his life, such as being a devoted father and husband and a skilled potter. Quinn is particularly proud of having spearheaded a 1987 effort to preserve and restore an 18th-century farmhouse near his home that was slated for demolition. But the public seems unanimous in its opinion that none of these accomplishments are as noteworthy as the colon-obstructing disease that bears his name. ""I heard that Lou Gehrig had a problem with ALS being named after him,"" Quinn said. ""He was always telling his wife, 'You know, I was a completely disease-free pro ballplayer for more than a decade before I started to show even the slightest symptoms.' Boy, can I relate. Except, at least Lou Gehrig's Disease is also referred to as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. They've never even given my condition a scientific name. It's just Quinn's Disease, and that's it."" Continued Quinn: ""Sometimes, I wish I'd contracted a syndrome instead of a disease. Syndromes are often given descriptive names like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I begged the doctors to reclassify my disease as a syndrome and call it, say, 'Anal-Blockage Syndrome,' but he refused because, technically, a syndrome is defined as a group of various symptoms that culminate in an abnormality. Mine is not an abnormality: I just can't shit properly."" Nevertheless, Quinn remains hopeful that, by giving the disease a human face, he has helped raise awareness of Quinn's Disease, increasing the likelihood of a cure. ""If my pioneering example can help one day eradicate this terrible disease, it will have all been worth it,"" Quinn said. ""But until that day comes, I'm just Nicky Quinn, the exploding-feces guy."""
Bush Vows To Wipe Out Prescription-Drug Addiction Among Seniors,8/22/01,3756,"WASHINGTON, DC—Pledging to help ""the millions of elderly Americans who can't get through the day without popping pills or shooting up insulin,"" President Bush announced Monday that he is committed to wiping out prescription-drug use among seniors.

""In the past, we as a nation have enabled such addiction through the billions of dollars we give to programs like Medicare, but this has got to stop."" To help combat the problem, Bush is proposing stricter regulations for both doctors and pharmacists. ""Right now, drugs like Donepezil and Vasotec can be obtained with little more than a single visit to the doctor. This can no longer be allowed to go on,"" Bush said. ""We must attack the problem at the source: the HMO-backed medical professionals who prescribe, or 'deal,' cheap prescription drugs. If we crack down on them, seniors will have a lot harder time getting their fixes."" According to a recent report by the National Institute On Drug Abuse, as many as 1,800,000 Americans over the age of 65 may be dependent on Medicare-provided prescription drugs. Bush warned that the actual number of habitual users may be even higher. ""Surprising as it may be, young people are not the ones doing most of the prescription drugs,"" Bush said. ""Seniors are responsible for a shocking 70 percent of Amiodarone abuse in this country. Nitroglycerine use among the elderly has reached similarly epidemic proportions. Because such substances are obtained legally, compounded with the clouded judgment which results from drug use, many of these addicts aren't even aware they have a problem. It's up to our government to step in and break the cycle."" Claire Lakewood, director of Partnership For A Prescription-Drug-Free America, said the cycle of abuse is hard to break if seniors don't want to be helped. ""Older Americans tend to give in to peer pressure,"" Lakewood said. ""They just do what their doctor tells them because they want to 'be cool' or 'live,' and win their doctor's approval. They also want to fit in with all their other elderly friends, who, no doubt, are doing these prescription drugs, too."" Fortunately, prescription-drug addicts will not have to conquer their addictions alone. Bush said his plan will emphasize rehabilitation over punishment. ""Our only goal is to provide help to those in need,"" Bush said. ""Locking up these seniors would be cruel, costly, and, in the long run, counterproductive. Treatment and counseling is the only real answer."" U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said his department is taking steps to help the drug-addicted. Outpatient treatment centers will be established at local senior centers, he said, and a 40-page booklet titled ""Hugs, Not Dronabinol"" will guide homebound seniors through the difficult road to clean living. ""Let's kick drugs out of our nursing homes and senior centers once and for all,"" Thompson said. As part of Bush's anti-prescription-drug effort, a PSA campaign will soon be launched. The first such ad will feature ""Sammy The Senior,"" a cartoon octogenarian kicking up his heels with the aid of a walker, accompanied by the slogan, ""I've Got Better Things To Do Than Take Prescription Drugs!"" Hazel Tenney, a 72-year-old Tulsa, OK, resident, is among the many older Americans now questioning their drug use. ""Every day, for nearly seven years, I've taken Hydralazine to treat my high blood pressure,"" Tenney said. ""But after hearing what President Bush said, I threw my pills away. Today, I'm feeling short of breath and dizzy, but if I can just make it through these withdrawal symptoms, with God's help, I will finally be drug-free."""
Surgeon General: Americans Have Gigantic Fat Asses,6/13/01,3477,"WASHINGTON, DC–According to a report released Monday by the Surgeon General’s office, 67 percent of U.S. citizens have gigantic fat asses, with that number projected to climb significantly in the next decade. The report is the latest in a string of dire findings from Surgeon General David Satcher concerning the high percentage of Americans who suffer from fatness of ass. “The state of the American derriere has reached crisis proportions,” Satcher said. “Without immediate steps to rectify this problem, we can only foresee even more hideously huge backsides as we continue to blimp out into the 21st century.” The strongly worded report, in which Americans are alternately described as “porkers,” “wide loads,” and “friggin’ whales,” attributes the fat asses primarily to poor eating habits, with diets heavy on sugar, starches, and saturated fats. It also cites Americans’ lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyles as factors in the trend toward “huge bucket-butts.” In addition, the report found that roughly 185 million Americans are “flab-ass flabbos who couldn’t say no to a candy bar if their fat, stupid lives depended on it.” It went on to warn that those with “gargantuan, sun-blocking rear ends” stand at greater risk of conditions ranging from heart disease to hideousness. The Surgeon General said the solution to the national health crisis lies in obese citizens “somehow dredging up the shred of dignity needed to drag their rotund, repellent posteriors to a gym, for Christ’s sake.” He also encouraged those with American Fat-Ass Syndrome, or AFAS, to “lay off the sour-cream-and-chive Ruffles.” The report has provoked outrage among the public at large. “Okay, so we could all stand to lose a few pounds, but I don’t see the need for such insulting language,” said Nancy Goode, 48, a morbidly obese St. Cloud, MN, housewife with diabetes, knee problems, and an ass so ludicrously huge it looks like some sort of mutant, land-bound dugong. “Besides, lots of people in this country are very slim and attractive. I see them on TV every day.” Experts say Goode’s response is symptomatic of the severe denial inherent in most Americans’ self-images. “Because of what they see on television and in advertising, many Americans are convinced that the nation is largely populated with hot, hard-bodied models who consume nothing but Pepsi and Chee-tos,” said Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson. “This notion, however, couldn’t be further from the truth. All you need to do is look around to see that we are, in the main, grotesque, repulsive fat fucks who have long ago given up maintaining a mote of basic pride.” Though the alarmist tone of the report may come as a shock to Americans accustomed to the enormous asses of themselves and their neighbors, the rest of the world has long been aware of Americans’ ovoid lower halves. This is apparent in the translations of various languages’ popular slang terms for Americans, such as “two-sacks-of-suet-in-skirts,” from Swedish; “bloated round-eye balloon-buttocks,” from Mandarin Chinese; and “hideous, hellbound hippo-humans,” from Swahili. “The time has come for Americans to face the truth about our collective fat ass,” Satcher said. “For too long, we have sat on our massive rump, mindlessly consuming 90 percent of the world’s resources and growing steadily bigger by the decade. It’s time to get off that fat ass and face the harsh reality of our enormous, distended, disgusting hind ends.”"
Hidden Valley Ranch Bombed By Balsamic Extremists,5/30/01,516,"HIDDEN VALLEY, CA–A radical Balsamic fundamentalist group detonated an estimated 800 pounds of TNT at the Hidden Valley Ranch compound Monday, killing 11 and injuring dozens more. ""Let no salad again be foully tainted by the corrupt regime of Hidden Valley,"" said Martin Pulaski, leader of the Nation Of Balsam, in a statement claiming responsibility for the deadly attack. ""We shall not rest until every salad's flavor is enhanced by a light and tangy vinaigrette, not buried in a shameful avalanche of buttermilk."""
Health-Food-Store Worker Dies Of Vitamin Lung,5/09/01,531,"SAUSALITO, CA–Duane Cristopher, longtime manager of the Brooks Street Health Food Co-op, died Sunday following a three-month battle with vitamin lung. ""Decades of inhaling a trace dust of vitamin supplements caused particles to accumulate over time in his lungs, ultimately cutting off his oxygen supply,"" said Dr. Arthur Washington, Christopher's physician. ""We also suspect bee pollen may have been a factor."" At Christopher's funeral Tuesday, family and friends commented admiringly on how natural the 57-year-old's body looked."
North Dakota Drinks Itself To Sleep Again,5/09/01,480,"BISMARCK, ND–Exhausted from another hard day in the wheat fields, the state of North Dakota drank itself to sleep Monday with the bottle of Old Thompson it keeps hidden in Fargo. ""Oh, they've been doing this a lot lately,"" South Dakota Gov. William Janklow said. ""Every night, they fall asleep on their respective couches with the local TV stations on all night."" Janklow expressed concern about waking the state, as North Dakota is known for its violent outbursts when hung over."
Grimacing Congressman Quickly Drafts Legislation For Charley-Horse Research,4/25/01,596,"WASHINGTON, DC–Grimacing in considerable pain Monday, Rep. William Delahunt (D-MA) quickly drafted and introduced the 2001 Charley Horse Research Appropriations Act, which would allocate $100 million for ""immediate research"" to find a charley-horse cure. ""Charley horses are a serious–oh, Jesus–medical condition that afflicts millions of Americans every day,"" Delahunt told House colleagues. ""And so let us–Christ, this kills–pass this bill as soon as possible."" When informed that the earliest the bill could be passed and signed into law is next Monday, Delahunt moaned and pounded the podium."
Woman's Day Writer Recounts Own Harrowing Battle With Caffeine Addiction,3/21/01,5066,"CLEARWATER, FL–Bravely coming forward in the hopes of helping others like herself, freelance Woman's Day writer Joanna Hoff described her harrowing battle with caffeine addiction in the magazine's April issue. ""I was a coffee junkie,"" Hoff wrote. ""I'd drink a cup in the morning just to get out of the house, and then another cup on the drive to work. But I wasn't done when I got to my desk job at the law firm–not by a country mile."" In her frank, seven-page article, Hoff confessed that she, like an alarming number of professional women in the U.S., got on ""the coffee train"" to help meet the demands of a hectic lifestyle. ""I was making three or four, sometimes five trips back to that [office] coffee maker,"" she wrote. ""It's free, it's fresh, and it keeps you chug-chug-chugging along through your busy day. Sooner or later, though, that kind of habit will catch up to you."" ""You never realize that, although it's a great pick-me-up, in the end it only makes you feel worse,"" Hoff continued. ""I kept telling my friends and loved ones that I was fine, but deep down, I knew something was terribly wrong. And the more I drank, the more extreme my denial became."" Speaking at a Woman's Day press conference to introduce the issue Monday, Hoff pointed to a chart listing the caffeine content of some common foods. As shown on the placard, eight ounces of coffee contains between 30 and 300 mg of caffeine, depending on its preparation, while black tea contains 45 to 75 mg of caffeine. Caffeine, Hoff noted, is also added to certain soft drinks. Among the most dangerous is Mountain Dew, a standard 12-ounce can of which contains 55 mg of ""the evil stuff."" ""I wish I could say my addiction was limited to coffee,"" Hoff said. ""But when I wasn't pounding the java, it was Mountain Dew. At my low point, I was drinking four cans a day. And even though I hated myself for it, I didn't want to stop."" Though caffeine is a natural stimulant, it can have many adverse side effects, including anxiety, insomnia, irritability, and headaches. Hoff said she experienced them all. ""There were nights when I'd lie in bed tossing and turning for hours,"" Hoff said. ""Even when I'd come home from work exhausted and just want to go straight to bed, the caffeine made it almost impossible. I never knew that my inability to fall asleep could be caused by caffeine I'd ingested up to 12 hours earlier. Looking back, it's frightening how little I knew about this beast that was controlling my life."" Perhaps the most alarming aspect of caffeine addiction, Hoff said, is the fact that many people–even doctors–assume the substance is harmless because it is not regulated by the FDA. ""The truth is that it is a drug like any other,"" Hoff said. ""It can alter moods and change behavior. That's a drug."" In her article, Hoff candidly confessed that her caffeine binges also caused severe mood swings. ""One day, my 8-year-old son was making noise playing in the next room,"" she wrote. ""It was the weekend, and I had a pounding, five-alarm headache–unbeknownst to me at the time, it was due to my not having had my regular dose of caffeine that day. Before I even knew what was happening, I'd snapped at my child… my own child."" The very next day, Hoff phoned Arlene Lewis, an old high-school friend who was now a nurse. After hearing Hoff describe her headaches, insomnia, and irritability, Lewis diagnosed her as a caffeine addict. Then she recommended that Hoff read Caffeine Freed by Dr. Charlotte Kelsey. Reading Caffeine Freed, Hoff learned that caffeine may exacerbate such conditions as migraine headaches, coronary heart disease, fibrocystic breast disease, prostrate trouble, or cardiac arrhythmia. It also is a diuretic and can be the cause of urinary-tract infections. Most important, the book taught Hoff that to kick the habit, a caffeine addict needs to begin to limit intake to between 100 and 1000 mg a day, depending on weight, eating habits, and personal bodily responses to caffeine. Armed with her newfound knowledge of her addiction, Hoff was finally able to take her first steps down the long road to recovery. Over the course of the next several months, she slowly reduced her intake, keeping a ""caffeine journal"" in which she jotted down the caffeine content of the foods she consumed throughout the day. ""I had no idea just how much caffeine I was taking in until I started to keep track,"" Hoff said. ""A piece of chocolate here, a can of Pepsi there–it was scary. Thank God I'm no longer that person."" Hoff said she is grateful that, as a Woman's Day writer, she had a platform to share her story with other caffeine addicts. ""Yes, this was difficult to talk about,"" Hoff said. ""But if there's just one woman out there who reads this article about what I went through and, as a result, gets the help she needs, it's all worth it."" Hoff has been a regular contributor to Woman's Day since 1991. In that time, she has written candid, first-hand accounts of her harrowing battles with such conditions as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, seasonal afflictive disorder, and PMS."
Jerry Lewis Undergoes Emergency Gefloigel Surgery,2/14/01,573,"LOS ANGELES–Less than an hour after doctors discovered that the gland had become all screwy with the infections, legendary comedian Jerry Lewis underwent emergency surgery to remove his gefloigel Monday. ""We had to go in through Mr. Lewis' schlaphlecky system, bypassing the oy-hayvel,"" said Dr. Jacob Weisz, Nice Mister Chief of Surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ""But in the end, we were able to get him all being better and healthy, you know."" Doctors have prescribed Lewis several weeks of bedrest, with the sleeping and the flowers and the nice music and hrrrrrn."
Receptionist At Chiropractor's Office Considering Pursuing Chiropractic Degree,2/07/01,3585,"BALTIMORE–Paula Budig, 33, a receptionist at Liberty Heights Chiropractic Clinic since November, confirmed Tuesday that she is seriously considering returning to school to pursue a degree in chiropractic medicine. ""When I answered the want ad for this job, I didn't really even know what a chiropractor did,"" said Budig, straightening the magazines in the patient waiting room. ""But after working at the clinic for a few months now, it seems like it would be a really great career."" Budig has already begun researching the possible career move. At lunch Monday, she talked to Dr. Wesley Lamp, one of the four chiropractors at the clinic, about what it's like to be a chiropractor. Upon returning to the office, she logged onto the web site for Baltimore Chiropractic College, Lamp's alma mater. ""They have a program at Baltimore Chiro where I could finish in three and a half years,"" Budig said. ""The first year and a half can be done in night classes, so I wouldn't even have to stop working until my third semester. Best of all, the campus is only 25 minutes from my apartment complex."" According to Budig, working at Liberty Heights Chiropractic Clinic gives her a considerable head start over any future classmates. ""Just being in this office, I've soaked up a ton of knowledge about the field,"" Budig said. ""I mean, all day long, I'm writing down messages from patients regarding the condition of their backs and then relaying them to the doctors. You can't help but learn when you're doing stuff like that."" Though Budig did not continue her education after high school, she said she has ""always known that option was there."" ""When I graduated, I was offered and accepted a managerial position at the Safeway where I'd been working,"" Budig said. ""I really wanted to buy a new Fiero at the time, so I figured school could wait."" After three years as assistant manager at Safeway and then four years at the Falls Road Roy Rogers, Budig decided to move out of the retail field. ""I felt it was time to get out and explore some other options,"" Budig said. ""I was working in the floral department at Safeway, and for a time I considered becoming a florist, but that never quite came together."" Within three months of leaving Roy Rogers, Budig landed a job as a receptionist at the law firm of Higgins, Damisch & Davis. ""For a while, I was pretty serious about going into law,"" Budig said. ""I even got some brochures from one of the local law schools. But then I got a job as a secretary at an advertising firm and found that field much better suited to my skills."" After numerous career detours and false starts, Budig believes she has found her true calling. ""I think I'm really well-suited to being a chiropractor,"" she said. ""For example, I give amazing back rubs, so I know I'd be good at working the various spinal bones. I just have, like, a natural aptitude with the human body."" Budig admitted that the lucrative nature of the profession is also a plus. ""Right now, I make $22K per year,"" she said. ""A chiropractor's starting salary is easily $35K. Plus, they get paid vacations and great benefits and all that. I get paid for holidays, but that's it. And I have a 30 percent co-pay for my insurance."" Budig said she would likely be able to do her six-month internship at Liberty Heights Chiropractic Clinic, and that upon graduation, she would have an inside track to a job at the clinic. ""The doctors are always complaining about how they're understaffed,"" Budig said. ""They seriously need more chiropractors working here. Believe me, I should know: I do patient scheduling."""
Shingles Sufferer Sick Of Explaining What Shingles Is,12/06/00,539,"NEWPORT NEWS, VA– Meredith Burr, a Newport News human-resources administrator who contracted shingles three weeks ago, announced Tuesday that she is ""completely fed up"" with explaining what the illness is. ""For the last time, shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash similar to chicken pox,"" Burr said. ""The medical term is herpes zoster, and it usually lasts from two to five weeks. Now will you leave me alone? My skin is burning."" Burr added that shingles should not be confused with piles, rickets, scurvy, or the gout."
Howard Stern Organizes Women's Health Symposium,11/01/00,4065,"NEW YORK–Citing his ""responsibility as a public figure to the betterment of the community"" and his ""longstanding commitment to issues of concern to women,"" talk-radio personality Howard Stern announced Tuesday the First Annual Howard Stern Women's Health Symposium. A free community event to be held over the next five days in Central Park, the symposium will feature more than 30 women's-health-related lectures and workshops, including ""Maximizing The Female Ejaculation,"" ""Six Safe Ways To Wax The Bikini Area: A Demonstration,"" ""Combating Small-Breast Syndrome (SBS),"" and ""Lesbians: Miracles Of Nature."" The symposium will conclude Sunday with an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for largest group mammogram. ""Today's woman faces a multitude of specialized health concerns that may go ignored if awareness is not raised. Like, for example, she could get a real bad yeast infection,"" said Stern, broadcasting live from the event. ""Believe me, I oughta know, because I saw plenty of them on [estranged-wife] Alison, and they can get real nasty. Isn't that right, Robin?"" Upon receiving acknowledgement from on-air partner Robin Quivers that this was, in fact, true, Stern added: ""Robin's probably never had one herself, because she's got class. She knows how to wash down there. But some of these chicks out there, we're talking cottage-cheese discharge, the works."" Day one of the symposium, Stern said, will feature a number of events of interest to women. These include Stern's keynote speech, ""Implants: Silicone Or Saline?""; free breast-cancer screenings by Hank The Angry Drunken Dwarf; complimentary testing of women's buttocks for lunch-meat adhesiveness; and a special roundtable discussion of issues facing uninsured women of color, presided over by Wack Pack members Big Black, Angry Black, and King Of All Blacks. ""This is racist!"" Angry Black told reporters. ""Black women can't get no insurance in the white man's world!"" He then lapsed into a string of profanities. Subsequent events include free body appraisals by Stern's friend Ralph Cirella and Gary The Retard, as well as a Shaving Cream Battle Royale illustrating the importance of proper lubrication in pubic-hair removal. Stern will himself quiz three Penthouse centerfolds on reproductive-health issues. ""A lot of women don't know that a diet rich in folic acid is essential during pregnancy,"" Stern said. ""Also, we're going to have a gal on who has huge labia. Huge. I mean they hang off her like drapes."" On Friday, activities will focus on cosmetic surgery, culminating with a panel discussion mediated by Stern, porn star Houston, and Howard Stern Show head writer Jackie ""The Joke Man"" Martling. ""Guy tells his wife, 'Honey, you got some saggy goddamn breasts,'"" Martling said. ""She says, 'Don't complain, it's cheaper than plastic surgery, 'cause at least they drag some of the wrinkles out of my fuckin' face!'"" Stern stressed that the event is a non-profit public-health initiative. ""As we learn how to better meet the needs of the public, our event should only continue to get better in the coming years,"" Stern told New York Times reporter Samantha Matheson. ""You know, for a woman in your 30s, you're not half bad. Turn around. Yeah, you've got a nice little ass on you, honey."" Added Stern: ""God, I'd love to bang you."" Pausing a moment to transfer Matheson to his lap, Stern continued: ""We hope in time to establish the Howard Stern Women's Health Foundation as the nation's leading organ of women's health awareness."" Upon hearing Stern use the word ""organ,"" longtime sound-effects man Fred Norris activated a pre-recorded comic ""sproing"" sound. Stern explained that his creation of the symposium was largely motivated by his recent divorce. ""Alison was a hell of a gal, and sometimes I think that if I'd been more knowledgeable about and attentive to her various female-specific problems–of which there were, Christ, maybe 10 million?–perhaps we could have worked it out,"" Stern said. ""Plus, I'm dating again, and there'll be a lot of broads there with huge cans."""
Man With Hodgkin's Disease Way Over Sick-Day Limit,10/25/00,3861,"PULASKI, TN–Atco Tool & Design machinist Richie Loftus, diagnosed four months ago with Hodgkin's Disease, has already exceeded his allotted number of sick days for the year, his employers warned Monday. ""It's unfortunate, what's happening with Richie, but company policy clearly states that employees are permitted 15 sick days per year,"" Atco Tool & Design office manager Mike Phelan said. ""Richie's already missed a month and a half of work since June. You just can't run a business that way."" Loftus, 32, admitted that his constant fever, crippling fatigue, and malignant splenomegaly has affected his job performance. ""I've definitely missed my share of days,"" said Loftus, diagnosed with Stage III Hodgkin's lymphoma on June 20 after a steady decline in health prompted a biopsy. ""I've tried to keep my chemotherapy sessions down to just one a week so I don't have to drop down to part-time at Atco and lose my health coverage, but it's been tough."" Though Loftus used a majority of his sick days after the diagnosis, Phelan noted that he had not been a paragon of regular attendance beforehand. ""By the time Richie went in for his tests in late June, he had already missed a heck of a lot of work,"" said Phelan, leafing through Loftus' personal file. ""In fact, the week before the disease even started, he was out for three days because of headaches, nausea, and vomiting."" ""And even when he was here,"" Phelan continued, ""he wasn't anywhere near as productive as we'd have liked, always needing to lay down in the break room. So we're not exactly talking about the most reliable employee to begin with."" Loftus said he has tried to make adjustments in his approach to the job, but it has been difficult. ""I've tried to find a way to get around this whole illness thing,"" said Loftus, resting on his living-room couch after a morning of radiation therapy. ""Unfortunately, I don't have the kind of job where I can work from home, even if I had the energy and lucidity to do so. And even when I can make it into the shop, it's tough to work the machines, because these club fingers I've developed are just as ridden with subdural hemophilia as the rest of me. I feel terrible about being such a drain on AT&D."" Nearly broke, Loftus recently asked Atco Tool & Design management if he could take some of the 22 paid personal days and 31 vacation days he has accumulated during his six years with the company, and use them as sick days. The request was denied. ""They said I couldn't do that, because that would open up a whole can of worms, with employees messing around and mixing up the different types of paid leave,"" Loftus said. ""They did say, though, that I should feel free to use my vacation days and take a nice trip to Hawaii or somewhere–so long as I don't get any treatment while I'm there."" Added Loftus: ""Hawaii probably wouldn't be much fun, anyway, what with this explosive diarrhea."" Loftus' expensive treatment is 80 percent covered by his employee health plan, a benefit that is costing Atco Tool & Design a significant amount of money. ""Richie's type of extended-illness coverage costs this company an extra $22 per employee per month. That adds up. Not only that, but he goes through Cisplatin, Cytarabine, and Dexamethasone like they were going out of style,"" said Atco Tool & Design general manager Mel Huffinger. ""And those drugs are not cheap, that's for sure. Richie would have to work here another 45 years without a single major illness for us to break even on him. And we all know that ain't gonna happen."" ""I feel for Richie, obviously, but I don't think anyone would hold him up as a model employee,"" Phelan said. ""He's a decent guy, and I hope he gets through this and becomes a healthy, productive worker again as soon as he can. But right now, he's hardly giving us incentive to hire Hodgkin's Disease sufferers in the future."""

More U.S. Children Being Diagnosed With Youthful Tendency Disorder,9/27/00,5135,"REDLANDS, CA–Nicholas and Beverly Serna's daughter Caitlin was only four years old, but they already knew there was a problem. Day after day, upon arriving home from preschool, Caitlin would retreat into a bizarre fantasy world. Sometimes, she would pretend to be people and things she was not. Other times, without warning, she would burst into nonsensical song. Some days she would run directionless through the backyard of the Sernas' comfortable Redlands home, laughing and shrieking as she chased imaginary objects. When months of sessions with a local psychologist failed to yield an answer, Nicholas and Beverly took Caitlin to a prominent Los Angeles pediatric neurologist for more exhaustive testing. Finally, on Sept. 11, the Sernas received the heartbreaking news: Caitlin was among a growing legion of U.S. children suffering from Youthful Tendency Disorder. ""As horrible as the diagnosis was, it was a relief to finally know,"" said Beverly. ""At least we knew we weren't bad parents. We simply had a child who was born with a medical disorder."" Youthful Tendency Disorder (YTD), a poorly understood neurological condition that afflicts an estimated 20 million U.S. children, is characterized by a variety of senseless, unproductive physical and mental exercises, often lasting hours at a time. In the thrall of YTD, sufferers run, jump, climb, twirl, shout, dance, do cartwheels, and enter unreal, unexplainable states of ""make-believe."" ""The Youthful child has a kind of love/hate relationship with reality,"" said Johns Hopkins University YTD expert Dr. Avi Gwertzman. ""Unfit to join the adult world, they struggle to learn its mores and rules in a process that can take the entirety of their childhood. In the meantime, their emotional and perceptive problems cause them to act out in unpredictable and extremely juvenile ways. It's as though they can only take so much reality; they have to 'check out,' to go Youthful for a while."" On a beautiful autumn day in Asheville, NC, six-year-old Cameron Boudreaux is swinging on a park swingset–a monotonous, back-and-forth action that apparently gives him solace. Spotting his mother on a nearby bench, Cameron rushes eagerly to her and asks, ""Guess what?"" His mother responds with a friendly, ""What?"" With unbridled glee, Cameron shouts, ""Chicken butt!""—cryptic words understood only by him—before laughing and dashing off again, leaving his mother distraught over yet another baffling non-conversation. ""I must admit, it's been a struggle,"" Mary Boudreaux said. ""What can I say to him when he says something like that, something that makes no sense? Or when he runs through the house yelling while I'm trying to balance the checkbook? You can't just say, 'Please, Cameron, don't have a disorder for just a few minutes so I can concentrate.'"" Cameron's psychological problems run even deeper. He can name every one of his beloved, imaginary Pokemon characters, but the plain realities of the actual world he inhabits are an enigma: Ask Cameron the name of the real-life city councilman sponsoring the referendum to renovate the park just across the street from his house–a park he plays in daily–and he draws a blank. According to Dr. Dinesh Agarwal, director of child psychiatry at NYU Medical Center, such disconnectedness from reality is a coping mechanism for YTD sufferers. ""The Youthful child is born into a world he or she does not fully understand,"" Agarwal said. ""Their brain pathways are still forming, and they need to repetitively relearn how to assimilate into society. These disassociative play-fantasies apparently help them accomplish that."" But such fantasies come at a price, producing in Youthful children a disinterest in the everyday responsibilities of life bordering on contempt. ""Jesse knows when it's his turn to take out the trash. We've gone over the house rules a dozen times,"" said Richard Torres, a Davenport, IA, father of three whose nine-year-old son Jesse was recently diagnosed with YTD. ""And still he neglects the job time and again."" Slowly, methodically, through an elaborate system of rewards and punishments, Jesse has shown improvement. But the road ahead is long. ""We get a lot of platitudes from the so-called experts,"" Torres said. ""We hear a lot of, 'Oh, he'll grow out of it, just give it time.' That's easy for them to say–their kid's not running around the neighborhood claiming to be Superman."" Help for families struggling with YTD may soon be on the way. At last month's annual AMA Convention, Smithkline-Beecham unveiled Juvenol, a promising YTD drug which, pending FDA approval, could reach the U.S. market as early as next spring. Already available in France and Sweden, Juvenol, the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported, resulted in a 60 percent decrease in running and jumping among users. But until such help arrives, the parents of YTD sufferers can do little more than try to get through each day. ""I love my child with all my heart,"" said Alexandra Torres, Jesse's mother. ""But when he's in the throes of one of his skipping fits, it's hard not to feel a little envious of parents with normal, healthy children."""
Rare Disease Nabs Big-Time Celebrity Spokesman,9/20/00,4231,"BALTIMORE–Flehner-Lathrop Syndrome Foundation officials excitedly announced Monday that actor Ted Danson has been diagnosed with the rare, deadly degenerative disease, bringing much-needed star power to their cause. ""This is the big one we've been waiting for,"" said Paula Brooks, director of the Baltimore-based FLS Foundation. ""For years, our organization struggled with scant funding, a dearth of resources, and the lack of a prominent spokesperson to draw attention to this dread disease. Then, out of the blue, Ted Danson! Needless to say, we're elated."" ""Before this,"" Brooks continued, ""the closest thing we had to a celebrity afflicted with FLS was a cousin of Al Jarreau's. Obviously, this is a big step up."" Flehner-Lathrop Syndrome, a genetic cardiac disorder which causes the heart's left ventricle to deteriorate and typically results in death within three to five years, affects fewer than 1 in 500,000 Americans–grim statistics for any disease seeking a high-profile celebrity to shine a spotlight on its cause. ""A disease this rare usually can't compete with the big boys,"" Brooks said. ""But this takes us to the next level. With Ted in our corner, FLS can hold its own against just about anybody, from Tay-Sachs to cystic fibrosis."" Danson, 52, best known for his role as bartender Sam Malone on the hit 1980s NBC sitcom Cheers and currently the star of CBS's Becker, was diagnosed with FLS Sept. 12, five days after complaining of chest pain during a celebrity golf tournament in Palm Springs, CA. The diagnosis has delighted sufferers of the disease and their loved ones. ""I've been a fan of Ted Danson's forever,"" said West Columbia, SC, resident Emily Dutler, whose 11-year-old son Seth was stricken with FLS last year. ""I mean, I've probably seen every episode of Cheers five times. I can't tell you what a godsend this is to have him speaking and fundraising on Seth's behalf. We've prayed for something like this to happen."" ""This really puts us in position for a very lucrative run,"" wrote Brooks in the September/October issue of Heartbeats, the FLS Foundation's bimonthly newsletter. ""We can expect three or four good years of impassioned spokesmanship from Ted, followed by several months of heartrending images of his brave, final battle with FLS–the kind of thing that really jerks tears and gets donations pouring in. Then, when Ted finally dies, expect a full week's worth of tributes in USA Today and on Entertainment Tonight that mention his love for our organization. Then there's the cover of People, guaranteed. All told, that translates to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million in free advertising and promotion."" ""It really is amazing,"" said Mark Knoll, national director of communications for the FLS Foundation. ""I know of diseases that afflict 10 to 20 times as many people as ours, and they don't have a spokesperson anywhere near as big as Ted Danson. I mean, look at cardiofibrilitis–1 in 20,000 Americans are afflicted, and all they've got is Alfonso Ribeiro. Talk about low-wattage advocacy."" ""And it's not like Danson is some washed-up star with nothing but a couple of Emmys and his memories,"" Knoll continued. ""I mean, Becker is one of the top-rated television shows in the country, with a choice Monday-night slot between Everybody Loves Raymond and Family Law. You can't get much better than that."" The FLS Foundation is already moving ahead with a promotional campaign to capitalize on its new celebrity sufferer. In next week's issue of Time, the organization will run a full-page ad featuring a photo of Danson accompanied by the words, ""Making Your Way In The World Today Takes Everything You've Got… Especially If You've Got An Incurable Cardiac Disorder Like Flehner-Lathrop Syndrome."" ""Make no mistake,"" Brooks said, ""Mr. Danson is going to get the red-carpet treatment from us. When he sees how grateful we are, I think Ted will agree he couldn't have come down with a better fatal disease than Flehner-Lathrop Syndrome."" Pausing to open a letter that had just come across her desk, Brooks emitted a delighted squeal and brandished the newest bequest to the FLS Foundation: a check for $250,000 from CBS Television. ""Couldn't you just die?"" a gleeful Brooks said."

Area Man's Recommended Daily Caloric Intake Exceeded By 9 A.M.,9/06/00,565,"MEMPHIS, TN–At 8:56 a.m. Monday, Len Blake consumed his 2,401st calorie of the day, surpassing his recommended daily caloric intake of 2,400 a full 14 hours before bedtime.

Hershey's Ordered To Pay Obese Americans $135 Billion,8/02/00,4441,"HERSHEY, PA–In one of the largest product-liability rulings in U.S. history, the Hershey Foods Corporation was ordered by a Pennsylvania jury Monday to pay $135 billion in restitution fees to 900,000 obese Americans who for years consumed the company's fattening snack foods. ""Let this verdict send a clear message to Big Chocolate,"" said Pennsylvania Attorney General Andrew Garsten, addressing reporters following the historic ruling. ""If you knowingly sell products that cause obesity, you will pay."" The five-state class-action suit accused Hershey's of ""knowingly and willfully marketing rich, fatty candy bars containing chocolate and other ingredients of negligible nutritional value."" The company was also charged with publishing nutritional information only under pressure from the government, marketing products to children, and artificially ""spiking"" their products with such substances as peanuts, crisped rice, and caramel to increase consumer appeal. Jurors took less than five hours to reach the decision following a two-year trial covering nearly one million snackers in Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, Arizona, and Texas. A majority of the unprecedented punitive damages will go toward obesity victims and their immediate families. The remainder will be funneled into weight-loss and youth-snacking prevention programs. ""This is a vindication for myself and all chocolate victims,"" said Beaumont, TX, resident Earl Hoffler, holding a picture of his wife Emily, who in 1998 succumbed to obesity after nearly 40 years of chocoholism. ""This award cannot bring Emily back, but I take some comfort knowing that her tragic, unnecessary death did not go unpunished."" Hoffler's teary-eyed account of his wife's brave battle against chocolate was widely regarded as the emotional high point of the trial. First introduced to Hershey's chocolate as a young trick-or-treater, Emily quickly developed a four-bar-a-day habit, turning in adulthood to Hershey's Special Dark, a stronger, unfiltered form of the product. By age 47, she had ballooned to 352 pounds and was a full-blown chocoholic. What little savings the family had was drained by Weight Watchers memberships, Richard Simmons videotapes, and Fat Trapper pills, all of which proved futile and only prolonged the Tofflers' agonizing ordeal. Equally pleased by the ruling was Mel Brewer of Phoenix, whose father received free chocolate as a soldier during World War II. ""Dad came back from Europe hooked,"" Brewer said. ""Before long, he was going through a case of Mounds and Mr. Goodbars a week. He wouldn't eat ice cream without Hershey's chocolate syrup and crushed Heath bars on it. He died of a heart attack at age 54 weighing 415 pounds."" With litigation pending against the nation's top five chocolate makers, including a $102 billion Mississippi suit against Nestle, the entire industry is on alert. Big Chocolate has already suffered numerous major setbacks in recent years. In 1997, a California judge ordered chocolate manufacturers to fund $27 billion in education programs to prevent youth chocolate consumption. In 1999, a federal judge prohibited chocolate advertising on TV and billboards and banned the use of cartoon imagery in advertising. In addition, the judge ruled that a warning label must be placed on all chocolate products reading, ""The Surgeon General Has Determined That Eating Chocolate May Lead To Being Really Fat."" Lawyers for the Hershey Corporation said the company intends to appeal the decision, which could drive the price of a 1.4-ounce pack of Rolos as high as $1.29. ""Adult consumers know the risks involved in using our products,"" Hershey's chief counsel Marvin Black said. ""They know that if not used in a responsible manner, there can be some negative consequences. But this is true of anything in life. Further, the decision to use our products is one that has always been left up to the individual. The Hershey Corporation has never forced anyone to use its products, nor has it ever intentionally added substances to its candies to increase addictiveness. If consumers are hooked, it is only because of said candy's overwhelmingly delicious chocolate goodness."" Whatever the outcome of the Hershey's appeal, the chocolate industry has irrevocably changed as a result of Monday's verdict. ""For over a century, Hershey's has lived off the fat of the land,"" Erie, PA, claimant Pamela Schiff said. ""Now it's time to pay us back."""
"Clinton To Get Teeth Cleaning, Glasses Before Coverage Runs Out",8/02/00,666,"WASHINGTON, DC–With less than six months remaining in his second term, President Clinton made appointments Monday for dental and optometry check-ups that are covered by his Physicians Plus presidential health plan. ""My teeth are fine, but I figured I should take advantage and get a cleaning before I get dropped next January,"" Clinton said. ""And if I get new glasses before then, Physicians Plus will cover the lenses and 60 percent of the cost of frames, so I'd be crazy not to."" Clinton said he was worried he was already too late to get in for an eye exam before leaving office, but Dr. Heitman, his designated optometrist, had an opening on Dec. 17 at 8:15 a.m."
Small Town's 'Cryptosporidium Daze' Fails To Attract Visitors,8/02/00,3238,"BLAKELY, GA–Blakely civic leaders were baffled last weekend as Cryptosporidium Daze, their elaborately planned summer festival celebrating the popular waterborne pathogen, failed to draw tourists to the Southwest Georgia town. ""Just as Colquitt celebrates its agricultural heritage with Watermelon Days, we wanted to host a festival that reflected the uniqueness of our community,"" Blakely Town Council president Jane Lyons said Monday. ""When someone suggested a theme inspired by the historical event we're best known for, the Great Cryptosporidium Outbreak of 1988, we knew we had the answer."" Twelve years ago, Lyons said, a small amount of pig feces seeped into the town's municipal water supply, contaminating it with cryptosporidium. As a result, 611 citizens contracted cryptosporidiosis, an intestinal disease marked by abdominal cramps, violent diarrhea, nausea, and fever. ""If it weren't for our town's brush with cryptosporidium, the EPA never would have enacted the Surface Water Treatment Act of 1989,"" Lyons said. ""It established drinking-water standards for the entire country–and it all started right here in Blakely!"" Much to the surprise of town-council members, unlike Colquitt's Watermelon Days and Columbia's Riverfest, which bring up to 15,000 visitors into the neighboring small towns each summer, Cryptosporidium Daze was sparsely attended. ""It's a real mystery,"" Lyons said. ""It was a nice, sunny day, the park was filled with booths, and somebody was out there in the big foam cryptosporidium mascot outfit shaking hands with everybody. Yet, somehow, the festival flopped."" The three-day event drew only seven non-residents, most of whom left shortly after arriving. ""I thought cryptosporidium was some type of flower,"" said Rhonda Weber, who drove to Blakely from Albany for the event. ""Turns out, I was thinking of chrysanthemum."" After an outlay of nearly $4,000 for decorations, advertising, and equipment rental, Lions Club president Gary Milstead estimated that Cryptosporidium Daze brought in less than $45 in revenue. ""We had a new mascot, Crypty The Cryptosporidium, created just for the event,"" said Milstead, pointing to poster bearing a grinning, single-celled parasite wearing a Blakely baseball cap. ""We still have plenty of T-shirts left for sale if you want one."" Even Blakely's own citizens were disinterested in the festival. A pageant to crown one lucky young Blakely girl ""Cryptosporidium Queen"" was canceled due to a lack of applicants. Other poorly received events included the Name That Parasite contest, the Water Boil, the cryptosporidium-themed ""haiku-off,"" and the Protozoan Parade, in which children could compete for prizes by dressing up as their favorite member of the phylum protozoa. With the unpopular event behind them, some members of the town council are wondering if they selected the wrong theme. ""Maybe people just aren't as interested in cryptosporidium as they were in the late '80s,"" Lyons said. ""Back then, if we announced a town meeting about cryptosporidium, every last person would show up. I have, however, heard a lot of buzz lately about the radon gas that was detected in some of the homes over by the railroad tracks. Well, I guess there's always next summer."""
Malignant Tumor Sees Every Day As Gift From God,7/19/00,3826,"MUNCIE, IN–On July 12, the cancerous growth imbedded in the brain tissue of Warren Lenders got the news no tumor ever wants to hear: chemotherapy. Facing the prospect of cancer-killing radiation, the six-month-old malignant brain tumor could have cursed the heavens for dealing it such a cruel fate. Instead, it chose to be grateful for the time it has left, viewing each new day as a gift from God. ""God put me on this Earth for a purpose: to attach myself to the parietal lobe of loving husband and father of three Warren Lenders,"" said the tumor, speaking from the left hemisphere of Lenders' cerebrum. ""But if He says it's time to go, then it's time to go. It is not for me to question why."" ""As it says in the Good Book,"" the high-grade cerebellar astrocytoma continued, ""'If you have received God's Gift of Grace, rejoice. Enjoy it every day.'"" After tragically losing most of its mass in a June 28 operation, the tumor is now in the midst of 12 grueling weeks of chemotherapy, a procedure doctors say it has a less than 20 percent chance of surviving. ""This has been the greatest trial of my entire life,"" the tumor said. ""Operations, radium bombardment, cesium. You name it, I've been through it. But just as He did with Job, the Lord is presenting me with these hardships as a way of testing my faith."" According to doctors at Indiana University Medical Center, where the tumor is being treated, malignancies of its kind generally have a 60 percent survival rate. But because the tumor was detected early, its chances are far worse. ""Statistically, the odds are against it, no question,"" chief oncologist Dr. Irwin Patel said. ""But this is one tough little tumor, and I wouldn't count it out. It's showing unusual tenacity for a supratentorial growth of its size. We thought the surgery would be the end, but when we got in there to debulk it, we found it had spread all over the place."" Throughout the ordeal, the tumor has found comfort in its strong Christian faith. ""Going into that surgery, I thought, 'Well, this could be the end of the line for me,'"" the tumor said. ""But, by some miracle, a few of my tendrils had adhered to the occipital lobe without the doctors realizing it, and I made it through the operation. I know in my heart it was God's hand guiding that surgeon's scalpel to the wrong place that day."" After the surgery, the tumor's weight had dropped to 9.8 grams. ""Some tumors might have thrown in the towel right then and there,"" it said. ""But I'm not the type. I need only remember the trials that Jesus went through while in His earthly form to realize that my trials have been nothing."" The tumor sees the fact that it is still alive as ""part of God's great plan."" ""May I quote The Bible again? 'For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,'"" the tumor said. ""I guess I'm so calm because I know that when it's my time to go, a better life awaits me in Heaven, where I will be rewarded for my faith with a glorious bounty of ganglion and glial cells, the likes of which a mortal being like myself cannot even conceive."" With its time possibly drawing to a close, the tumor reflected on its life. ""Honestly, I've been lucky,"" it said. ""I could have been born an easily detectable epidermoid cyst and been destroyed swiftly. But instead, I was hidden by the bone matter of Lenders' skull and went undetected by X-rays for months."" The tumor also draws comfort and strength from its offspring. ""In my life, I've been fortunate enough to metastasize three dozen beautiful little cancerous cell masses, which I've sent off into the cerebrospinal fluid,"" it said. ""Right now, they're just imperceptible growths on the spinal cord and medulla. But, God willing, when I've gone to my maker, they will be there to carry on my work. Praise the Lord."""
"Acne Medication May Cause Dizziness, Nausea, Loss Of Hearing, Insomnia, Blood Clotting, Difficulty Breathing",6/21/00,655,"RAMAPO, NJ–Dermalon, a new acne medication from Ramapo-based Franklin Laboratories, may cause a host of serious complications, a TV commercial for the product casually noted Monday.

Slightly Upset Woman Declared Insane,5/24/00,3331,"NORTH CALDWELL, NJ–Area resident Gayle Wenzel, 44, was declared legally insane Monday after becoming upset over a living-room mess caused by her husband Milt's Friday-night get-together with friends. ""Apparently, Gayle came home after being gone all weekend, saw the condition of the living room, and just completely lost it,"" said Dr. Marvin Schaffer, director of hysteriatrics at St. Joseph's Hospital in nearby Montclair. ""This is clearly a clinically psychotic individual who has no grip on reality and no control over her own actions or emotions. You know how women get."" Wenzel, who insists that she was ""only mad for about two minutes,"" is currently under 24-hour watch at St. Joseph's. According to Milt, on Sunday evening, Gayle returned home after spending four days in Kansas City helping her sister recover from back surgery. Upon entering the living room, she found empty beer cans scattered across the floor, an ashtray overturned on the rug, and a pile of dirty dishes on the end table next to the couch. ""Gayle asked me what happened. I told her that some of the guys came over Friday night, but that I didn't clean up because I couldn't find the vacuum cleaner,"" Milt said. ""That's when she went nuts."" ""You left that mess for me to clean up. You had zero intention of ever doing it yourself, Milt,"" Wenzel reportedly yelled like a lunatic. ""Well, I'm not touching it. I've spent the entire day in airports, and I have to be up for work at 6 a.m. tomorrow. You clean it."" Milt said that all of his many attempts to make his psychotic wife listen to reason failed. ""Gayle was out of her mind,"" Milt said. ""I was pleading with her, 'Honey, calm down. What's the big deal? You're acting insane. Get it together.' But she just kept freaking out."" Twenty minutes later, after putting her bags away and showering, Wenzel went back downstairs to discover a team of emergency medical technicians and crisis-intervention counselors waiting for her. After placing Wenzel in restraints and rushing her to St. Joseph's Hospital, doctors were able to administer a strong sedative. ""I had to do something to ensure that Gayle wouldn't harm herself or others,"" said Dr. Gilbert Perry, who handled Wenzel's hospital admission. ""Gayle was out of her mind. I mean, come on, a few beer cans lying around and she completely goes off the deep end? As soon as I learned that the outburst was not menstruation-related, as I'd initially assumed, I ordered her hospitalized. I couldn't let an unbalanced, over-emotional woman like that out on the streets."" Wenzel has allegedly had a long history of out-of-control behavior, particularly at work. According to coworkers, she has reacted irrationally to everything from having to work weekends to having her assigned parking spot taken away. ""Last week, I made a little friendly joke about the dark hair on Gayle's upper lip by calling her Tom Selleck,"" said Stuart Runnels, a fellow claims processor at Mid-American Insurance. ""You should've seen her flip out. I was just kidding around, but she gets all deranged and says, 'I really don't think that was very funny at all, Stan. I don't make fun of your personal appearance.'"" Runnels said he responded by making cuckoo noises and backing away from Wenzel with an exaggerated look of fright. ""What can I say?"" Runnels said. ""She's crazy."""
Internet Opens Up Whole New World Of Illness For Local Hypochondriac,5/03/00,3939,"MERIDEN, CT–All her life, Janet Hartley has suffered from a host of ill-defined viruses and inexplicable aches and pains, diagnosing herself with everything from diabetes to cancer. But ever since discovering such online medical resources as WebMD, drkoop.com, and Yahoo! Health, the 41-year-old hypochondriac has had a whole new world of imaginary illnesses opened up to her. ""The Internet has really revolutionized my ability to keep on top of my medical problems,"" said Hartley, speaking from her bed. ""For instance, I used to think my headaches were just really bad migraines. But then last week, while searching Mt. Sinai Hospital's online medical database, I learned about something much more serious called cranial AVM, or arteriovascular malformation, which, along with headache pain, may also result in dizziness, loss of concentration, and impaired vision. I immediately thought to myself, 'Hey, that's exactly what happens to me.'"" In addition to regularly surfing various general medical-reference sites, Hartley makes frequent use of medical-school research sites, drug-company FAQs, and bulletin-board services for terminally ill patients in her ongoing quest to self-diagnose her hypothetical maladies. ""No more thumbing through the two-volume Physician's Desk Reference, a repetitive motion which led to my carpal tunnel syndrome,"" said Hartley, her wrists wrapped in ointment-soaked Ace bandages. ""It felt great when I could finally throw that old thing out. Except I think I slipped a disc in my back tossing it in the trash can."" Every day, provided she feels up to it, Hartley logs onto the Internet from her home. She also frequently logs on from work. ""Something in my office just isn't right,"" Hartley said. ""I always feel fatigued there, and for a long time, I suspected that the fluorescent lights were leaching the vitamins from my system. But according to a bunch of web sites I checked, that's unlikely. Then I thought maybe it was asbestos in the walls, but supposedly, there isn't any. So I spend some time on the Internet every day trying to figure out what exactly it might be."" With a vast array of medical resources available to her at the click of a mouse, Hartley has been able to investigate workplace maladies ranging from office-chair-induced lumbar-vertebrae displacement to the carcinogenic properties of coffeepot residue to the possibility of spinal-fluid poisoning resulting from carpet-fabric outgassing. But perhaps Hartley's favorite thing about the Internet is its ability to connect her with other hypochondriacs. ""Just the other day, I was at the chronic-fatigue-syndrome message board, talking to other sufferers like myself,"" said Hartley between coughing fits. ""I can't tell you how reassuring it was to be in the company of people who are not only going through the same things I am, but who know I'm not just making this stuff up."" Despite her enthusiasm, Hartley cautioned that Web-based medical diagnosis remains an inexact science. ""It's still far too common for a person who knows she's sick to enter her symptoms and get a response back from the web site that says nothing's wrong,"" Hartley said. ""If that happens, you should get a second opinion from a different site. Or maybe take stock of your physical state again. You may have missed something that would alter your diagnosis. Or, if a web site is asking you 'yes or no' questions about the symptoms you're experiencing, just say yes to all of them. That way, you'll get a wider list of diseases, conditions, or syndromes you might have."" Hartley offered one final caution. ""Computers are great, but if you spend too much time in front of them, you run the risk of developing chronic ocular strain,"" she said. ""Not to mention the threat posed by monitor radiation, which I suspect played a part in my recent brain-cancer scare. Fortunately, though, if a computer makes you sick, you can then use it to help you get better."""
Mountain Dew Users May Go On To Use Harder Beverages,4/26/00,4353,"WASHINGTON, DC–The Office of the Surgeon General issued a warning Monday that sustained use of Mountain Dew–an addictive, caffeinated soft drink popular in youth-counterculture circles–may lead to the use of such harder beverages as Surge, Jolt, and even espresso. ""There are children as young as 10 in this country who regularly do the Dew,"" Surgeon General David Satcher said. ""While the risks associated with use of this extreme soda are lower than those of other, even more caffeinated substances, the decision to become a Mountain Dew user sends a young person down a dangerous path. It is the first step on the journey to hardcore beverage use."" ""'It's only Mountain Dew–I can handle it,' is something I hear all too often,"" Satcher added. According to UCLA Medical Center addiction specialist Dr. Audra Hurst, Mountain Dew is a ""gateway beverage,"" one that serves as a bridge between safe drinks like orange juice and milk and dangerous substances like black tea and ""Water Joe,"" the street name for a powerful strain of chemically enhanced caffeinated water. ""Everyone is familiar with the frightening image of the trembling, barely functional coffee addict, unable to face the world without his morning fix,"" Hurst said. ""But few people think about the beverages that coffee junkie started out on before working his way up to that pathetic state."" ""Regular Mountain Dew use sets the stage for far more serious things,"" said Lenora Nunez, president of Think Before You Drink, a New York-based soft-drink-industry watchdog group. ""You get hooked on it and, suddenly, walking into a Starbucks and ordering a double mochaccino with 144 mg of caffeine or slugging down a carton of Strawberry Quik at 90 grams of sugar a pop doesn't seem like the taboo it once was."" Early-stage Mountain Dew users describe experiencing a sweet, highly pleasurable oral sensation and, in high doses, a rush of energy known as ""doing the Dew."" In certain users, the product also induces feelings of extreme confidence and invulnerability, leading them to engage in such high-risk activities as bungee-jumping and skydiving. ""What many users don't realize until it's too late is that when the effects of the Mountain Dew wear off, their energy level plummets and they immediately start looking for another Mountain Dew, sending them spiraling downward into a cycle of dependence,"" Nunez said. ""Before they're even aware of it, the user has developed a profound psychological and physical dependence to the Dew."" Because it is legal and its use widespread, Mountain Dew is often assumed to be safe. The drink, however, is known to pose many medical risks. Clinical studies have linked its consumption to rapid heartbeat, insomnia, diuresis, anxiety, hyperactivity, and the inability to concentrate. In a trend Nunez calls ""alarming,"" recent studies have shown that the average age at which a child drinks his or her first Mountain Dew is plummeting, while recreational use among young people is sharply on the rise. ""A young child does not possess the maturity and decision-making faculties necessary to use Mountain Dew responsibly,"" Nunez said. ""I've seen kids as young as seven walk up to a soda machine on a street corner and plug their money in."" Exacerbating the problem is the fact that parents often dismiss their children's Mountain Dew use as harmless soda experimentation, something they themselves did when they were young. ""Mountain Dew came into vogue in the late '70s as a performance-enhancing beverage, consumed by young people seeking to prolong their enjoyment of such activities as horseback riding and rope-swinging over swimming holes,"" Hurst said. ""But that was a far more innocent time. Today, we know a lot more about the costs of recreational Dew use and what it can lead to."" Despite such warnings, most regular users dismiss the notion that Mountain Dew is a gateway drink. ""That's a bunch of bull,"" said Troy DeSilva, 31, a Petoskey, MI, auto mechanic who started drinking Mountain Dew at 13. ""What about the millions of decent, tax-paying, home-owning Mountain Dew users who have never gone on to use any harder beverages? Why don't we hear about them?"" ""I've been a six-pack-a-day Mountain Dew drinker for almost 20 years, and it hasn't negatively affected me whatsoever,"" DeSilva continued. ""If it did, I could quit any time I wanted to."""
Suicide Attempts A Desperate Cry For Death,3/15/00,4801,"BOSTON–Mental-health professionals have long characterized attempted suicide as a desperate cry for help, the last-ditch plea of a wounded soul who, more than anything else, longs to live. Not so, according to a study released Monday by the National Psychiatric Association. NPA researchers say those who try to take their own lives are, in fact, crying out for the sweet release of death. ""People who want to live do not typically engage in such behaviors as wrist-slashing and carbon-monoxide inhalation,"" said Dr. Rachel Leibman-Wald, head of the NPA study. ""To the contrary, this tends to be the behavior of individuals who long to depart this mortal coil and be enveloped in the warm, safe shroud of eternal rest."" ""When one is in terrible pain, be it physical or emotional,"" Leibman-Wald continued, ""the natural instinct is to end that pain, even if it means ending one's life. Sometimes, there is a viable alternative method of ending that pain other than suicide. Sometimes, there is not."" Conventional psychiatric wisdom holds that a suicide attempt is the brain's subconscious way of telling loved ones that an individual is in need of assistance. ""It now appears, however,"" the NPA report read, ""that in many cases, the attempted suicide is less a cry for help than simply a message from the brain to the body saying, 'Okay, time to die.'"" Because mental-health professionals' ability to provide the help such individuals are ""asking for"" is limited, and many patients are so mired in depression that they are beyond redemption anyway, many see in the study's findings a powerful argument for greater societal tolerance of suicidal behavior. ""We are finally learning that for some, suicide is not an attempt to get treatment, a step, if you will, on the road to healing,"" said noted psychotherapist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum. ""In a majority of cases, it is a step into painless oblivion where nothing can hurt you ever again."" In examining more than 2,500 case studies, NPA psychiatrists found that many suicidal patients did not fit the classic profile of someone desperately attempting to make his or her plight known to the outside world. Instead, in many cases, they simply represented horrible failures whose pitiful, ruined lives were unbearable. ""Many of these individuals were so pathetic,"" the report read, ""that any decent person would have to agree that they would be better off dead. Why prolong their pain? What point would there be?"" With this in mind, NPA psychiatrists argued that it is not only erroneous to assume that those who attempt suicide need help, but it may actually be cruel. ""To deny someone suffering a shattered, miserable existence the simple escape offered by suicide is nothing short of inhumane,"" said Dr. Stanley Temple, one of the study's co-authors. ""If you look at many of these nobodies, you'd be hard-pressed to argue that they would have even a slight chance of ever getting their lives into any semblance of a livable state. For these tortured, far-gone souls, it becomes more obvious each day that there is only one way out. Who are we as mental-health professionals to deny them this effective way out of their agony?"" Temple cited the case of Gregory Fryar, a 49-year-old Harwich, MA, man whose six failed marriages, dead-end job at a bread factory, lifelong addictions to alcohol and gambling, and two appearances on The Jenny Jones Show with various dysfunctional relatives led him to attempt suicide in March 1995. Misdiagnosed as a cry for help, the attempt led to years of hospitalization and counseling, which failed to improve his ugly, embarrassing existence. ""Had Fryar's physicians been more tolerant of his heartfelt and entirely justified longing for death, perhaps his agony would have ended five years ago,"" Temple said. ""Instead, this poor excuse for a life continues to this day. Who are we truly helping by giving such patients the 'help' they neither asked for nor wanted, when they could have easily found peace if left to their own suicidal devices?"" Said Leibman-Wald: ""There are lots of people out there who don't want to die, and for good reason: Their problems simply aren't bad enough. Let's focus on helping these people, people who have valid reasons to live, instead of wasting all this time and energy trying to help those who have very valid reasons to want to die."" Leibman-Wald said she hopes the study will help change public perceptions of suicide and usher in a more enlightened climate in which the needs of those who want to die are no longer ignored. ""Hopefully, someday, suicidal individuals' right to pursue their goal of death will be recognized and respected by the medical community,"" Leibman-Wald said. ""Until then, we are all guilty of allowing these poor, pathetic bastards' misery to go on far too long."""
Use Of Organic Peanut Butter Adds Two Minutes To Local Man's Life,2/16/00,689,"BERKELEY, CA–Vincent Dunst, manager of a Berkeley-area food cooperative, has added two minutes to his life by consuming organic peanut butter instead of major brands, health-food experts reported Monday. ""Store-bought brands like Jif and Skippy are loaded with artificial emulsifiers and preservatives. Some of them even contain brown dyes to make them look more 'peanut buttery,'"" Dunst said. ""This all-natural Sunset Farms peanut butter contains absolutely nothing but fresh peanuts and a little bit of sea salt–and, as an added bonus, the jar is glass instead of plastic."" Dunst has also added 22 seconds to his life by starting off each day with a frosty, fiber-rich ""Bulgur Smoothie."""

U.S. Bedwetters Decide Against Nationwide Awareness-Raising Campaign,11/17/99,2998,"WASHINGTON, DC–Spokespersons for the National Bedwetters Society announced Monday that the organization will scrap a nationwide campaign intended to ""raise awareness of our members' plight"" and ""put a positive face"" on the disorder. ""For years, bedwetters have hidden their heads in shame, frightened that people would find out about their terrible secret,"" said National Bedwetters Society director Peter Bey. ""But after giving it some thought, we decided that we'd like it to stay that way."" In an unaired television spot produced for the campaign, Americans from all walks of life are shown looking into the camera and saying, ""I wet the bed,"" as their names and cities of residence are displayed at the bottom of the screen. The spot ends with a toll-free number sufferers can call to receive information on support groups in their area, as well as receive hats, T-shirts and bumper stickers proudly proclaiming, ""I Urinate In My Sleep."" ""The ads were supposed to show that bedwetters are regular people just like you and me, and that any of your friends, co-workers or loved ones may have this problem,"" said Bey, wearing an oversized fedora, sunglasses and a fake moustache. ""It was a way for people like me to stand up and say, 'I wet the bed, and I'm not ashamed.' But after giving it some thought, we decided to pass on it."" The campaign, Bey noted, would have also increased bedwetters' awareness of the help currently available to them. ""Unfortunately, few bedwetters realize that there are many places they can turn to for help,"" Bey said. ""A lot of companies offer employees coverage or co-payment on adult diapers, rubber sheets and new mattresses. It's often as simple as asking your departmental head for the proper nocturnal-urination subsidy forms, then filling them out with the assistance of your company's human-resources coordinator and obtaining the voucher signatures of two co-workers."" The National Bedwetters Society had planned to focus on children between the ages of 5 and 14, who make up a large portion of the bedwetting population. A $300,000 ""Kid Kampaign"" would have sent NBS mascots ""Puddles The Pooch"" and ""Soaky The Salmon"" on a tour of elementary and junior-high schools around the nation, performing skits in which Puddles is embarrassed about his bedwetting until Soaky convinces him that ""wetter is better."" Young bedwetters would then have been invited to come onstage to sing ""I'm A Bedwetter"" in front of their classmates. They also would have been given yellow ""I'm A Whiz Kid!"" bandannas and temporary tattoos to help them overcome the stigma often attached to the condition. ""Our trial run of the skit in eight D.C.-area elementary schools was not as successful as we had hoped,"" said National Bedwetters Society public-relations director ""Steve,"" who requested that his real name not be used. ""Despite our best efforts, we didn't raise the self-esteem of the young bedwetters in the crowd all that much. I guess some esteem is better left unraised."""

Report: TV Helps Build Valuable Looking Skills,10/27/99,3413,"NEW YORK—A report released Monday by NYU's Center For Media Studies has found that television, accused by experts of diminishing children's attention spans and discouraging them from interacting with others, can actually help children as young as six months develop essential looking skills. ""In a study of over 5,000 children nationwide,"" the report read, ""those who watched cartoons for three hours had vastly increased looking capacities when tested the next day, compared to children who were encouraged to play sports and board games with other children for the same three-hour period. Staring and gazing skills were also markedly higher."" Data gathered in the study also indicated that visual-reception skills acquired at an early age tend to become lifelong assets. ""Extensive testing of adults who grew up in homes without television showed that such adults had difficulty staring blankly at things for longer than a few seconds,"" Center For Media Studies director Dr. Edward DeGaetano said. ""They frequently shifted their gaze and focus around the testing environment, often engaging others in the room in conversation and generally making a lot of disruptive noise and movement. Television-enriched adults, however, could sit and look at anything: a spot on the ceiling, a fire-alarm box, a stack of magazines on a table."" ""And even when the non-television-enriched adults could manage to look at a magazine,"" DeGaetano said, ""rather than deep-focus on the cover, they would open it and start restlessly looking at words and turning the pages."" The NYU study is seen as a major victory for television advocates. ""Fifty years ago, U.S. children were ranked almost dead-last worldwide in looking skills,"" said child-development expert Dr. Sandy Wexler. ""The past five decades have witnessed remarkable progress in that area, so much so that U.S. children now lead the world. Students in supposedly progressive nations like Sweden and France score far lower than Americans in standardized looking tests."" Wexler pointed to TV as the primary reason for the improvement, along with increased media attention, including the best-selling 1977 book Why Johnny Can't Look and NBC's early-'80s ""How To Watch Television"" public-service announcements. ""These 30-second spots starring zany comedian Lenny Schultz left no ambiguity in the minds of children who viewed them about how to properly watch television,"" Wexler said. President Clinton praised the nation's children for their looking prowess at a press conference Tuesday. He also announced the launch of a $1 billion ""Looking Good, America!"" initiative designed to provide impoverished children with badly needed televisions. ""Far too many of our economically disadvantaged young people,"" Clinton said, ""have nothing better than outdated black-and-white sets, dating back to the '80s or even '70s, to look at."" The president concluded with the sad tale of Beckley, WV, 10-year-old Nicholas Mullins, who, according to Clinton, gets all of his television from ""a 1982 black-and-white Zenith TV with a 13-inch screen, an antenna fashioned from a coathanger and aluminum foil, and an unpredictable vertical hold."" ""Child-development statistics tell us that Nicholas will probably do no better than graduate from high school looking at a third-grade level,"" Clinton said. ""If we cannot give Nicholas a better chance in life, then we as a nation have failed him."""

Coronary fallibility is a real possibility in the near future."""
U.S. Out Of My Uterus vs. We Must Deploy Troops To Jessica Linden's Uterus Immediately,9/22/99,4965,"It comes down to one thing: It's my body. Not Uncle Sam's, not Trent Lott's, not Pat Robertson's. Mine. Congress can demand a portion of my income, it can tell me how fast to drive, it can kill killers and anyone else it thinks it must to preserve a free and civil society. But my body—the skin, bones and organs that comprise me—is where the line gets drawn. The decision to have or not have a child is mine and mine alone. I am not cattle for the government to order about, demanding that I bring an unwanted child to term. Stripping me of the right to control my own destiny dehumanizes me, period. Anything less than my choice, on my terms, reduces me to property. The right-wing anti-choice movement loves to preach its views from an idealistic, pie-in-the-sky universe where nothing uncomfortable ever has to happen to anyone, but that's not reality. Life is filled with pain and hard choices. Choices one may or may not regret later. But it's that individual's right to make the choice. You think America is the land of the free? The last country on Earth that would ever oppress women? My grandmother remembers when women could not vote in this country. And, boy, do we have a lot more progress left to make. One certainly has to wonder: How would things be different if men could get pregnant? It would certainly be fun to watch the patriarchal elite of Congress scramble to cover themselves if it all changed overnight. And one more thing: Who would care for all the children born into a world that prohibits abortion? Who would be there to raise all those unwanted, abandoned children? It would certainly be a different world, full of orphanages jammed with parentless children, robbed of a fair chance to grow up in a stable environment because of what some politician deemed moral in some oak-walled chamber on Capitol Hill. To say nothing of the women maimed or even killed by barbaric, back-alley abortions because a bunch of rich, white men made the safe alternative unavailable to her. Keep your laws off my body, America. To protect America's interests, it is sometimes necessary to mobilize and deploy a military force. We now stand on the brink of such a time. The tactical importance of Jessica Linden's uterus to national security is twofold: First, with its rich, fertile walls, this uterus is a vital source of future Americans. Second, the uterus is situated in an extremely strategic location, leaving it vulnerable to a hostile foreign power. This uterus must be given top priority by the Pentagon. Establishing a strong U.S. military presence in Jessica Linden's uterine region is by far the most sensible course of action. I propose that four U.S. Army divisions be deployed to Jessica Linden's uterus no later than midnight Friday. Once there, a reconnaissance force of 200 men will be stationed on her cervical perimeter, denying entrance to any unauthorized personnel or equipment. Another two battalions will be stationed inside the uterus itself, where they will set up camp and, if necessary, conduct armed patrols in force. Remaining personnel will conduct amphibious patrol in the forward vaginal canal and as far back as the fallopian entrances, scouting for cervical dilation or other such activity. The entire operation will receive air support from a wing of Blackhawk helicopters, which will rotate in pairs patrolling the greater vaginal area. Our forces will constitute a impenetrable iron diaphragm, preventing any and all foreign elements from compromising uterine security. Should we encounter a foreign power disputing our claim upon the Linden uterus and surrounding vagina, we will be prepared to engage its forces in armed conflict. We will consider the nation's safety our number one priority, regardless of Ms. Linden's unwillingness to cooperate. The Pentagon will consider a full-scale invasion of Jessica Linden's ovaries only as a last resort, after all other options have been exhausted. We recognize in principle Jessica Linden's sovereignty over the ovarian territory, but to prevent the loss of the reproductive system to a hostile power, we are prepared to do what we must, even if that means conducting a firebombing and strafing campaign that may result in full military hysterectomy. If we must destroy the uterus in order to save it, so be it. If U.S. uterine occupation extends into the second week of October, we will install an irrigation and drainage system in anticipation of Miss Linden's menstrual cycle. This will not only benefit her, but provide our troops with a cleaner, more navigable terrain on which to conduct their military maneuvers. I will further recommend that Congress establish a new Military Medal of Valor, to be called The Distinguished Cervix Cross For Courage In The Uterine Theatre. Naval soldiers may also request a burial within Miss Linden in the event of loss of life. The U.S. must and will defend its interests in Jessica Linden's uterus, no matter what the costs."

Scientists Discover Gene Responsible For Eating Whole Goddamn Bag Of Chips,9/01/99,3290,"ITHACA, NY—In an announcement with major implications for future generations of big fat hogs, Cornell University geneticists announced Monday that they have isolated the specific DNA series that makes an individual susceptible to eating a whole goddamn bag of chips. ""We have long known that the tendency to sit down and eat the whole goddamn bag runs in certain families,"" said team leader Dr. Edward Alvaro. ""However, until we completed our work, we weren't sure whether the disposition to cram chips down your greasy gullet was genetic or whether it was a behavioral trait learned from one or both fat-fuck parents. With the discovery of gene series CHP-48/OZ-379, we have proof positive that single-case serial chip-eating is indeed hereditary."" For years, scientists have been aware of the numerous health complications linked to a person's predisposition to plop down and mow through a whole bag of chips, but it wasn't until now that they were able to isolate the gene that carries the trait. According to the Cornell team, series CHP-48/OZ-379 is a set of ""alleles,"" or collections of genetic material, that cause chip-eaters to develop a markedly larger number of chip-responsive nerve endings in their cerebral material. ""People with this gene have up to four times the amount of fritoceptors normally found in a human,"" Alvaro said. ""This increases their pleasure response to snaxamine-2, the human body's principal chip-eating hormone, which is released in response to giant handfuls of chips being shoveled into the mouth. This tends to promote entire-goddamn-bag-eating behavior in those individuals who possess the series."" One of the most interesting characteristics of the newly discovered series, researcher Dr. Paul Bergleiter said, is its tendency to appear more than once in the gene strands of a human subject. ""Series CHP-48/OZ-379, because it is a fairly large, or 'fat-assed,' allele, tends to just lie around at convenient sites on the DNA sequence,"" Bergleiter said. ""Though many subjects exhibit only one instance of this gene, on others we have found as many as four. This, of course, led these rather rare subjects to eat four times as many whole goddamn bags of chips as those in our control group."" Though many more fatsos must be studied to determine CHP-48/OZ-379's transmission pattern, conventional wisdom seems to indicate that the gene is recessive. ""Who would want to pass on their own intact genetic material to someone who just sat around eating chips all goddamn day?"" Bergleiter asked. ""Unless, of course, that was the only person you could find because you were such a big lard-ass yourself. That would probably be the only source of friendly RNA-transcriptive culture you could find."" Carriers of the CHP-48/OZ-379 gene are hailing the Cornell find. ""It is about time science took steps to help people like me—people who eat bags of chips like it's fucking popcorn,"" said 370-pound Erie, PA, resident Russell Roberts. ""I can't even get jogging pants in my size anymore."" The discovery is considered the most significant advance in gene-mapping since a University of Chicago team isolated the DNA strand that causes people to shovel spoonfuls of ice cream into their mouths while standing in front of the friggin' freezer with the door wide open."
Natural Light Very Important To Local Man,9/01/99,532,"HACIENDA HEIGHTS, CA—The natural light of the sun is extremely important to homeowner Gregg Dorner, it was reported Monday.

""Natural light also really suffuses the kitchen area and mutes the colors. I think it softens the lines, too."" According to neighbor Alexander Faulk, the Dorner home looks ""exactly the same"" as when artificial lights were used."
Traumatized Child Comforted By Television,8/25/99,5091,"MASON CITY, IA—In an inspiring story that has warmed hearts throughout this tight-knit northern Iowa community, a luminescent cathode-ray tube provided much-needed emotional nurturing and support for a traumatized child this week, comforting him in his time of need. Emotionally devastated by an auto accident that claimed the lives of his parents, 4-year-old Stevie Burke was feared ""permanently psychologically damaged"" by doctors. Yet tragedy became triumph when the orphaned child turned to television and, in the process, began the long road to healing. ""It's miraculous. When little Stevie was first admitted, he would alternate between a near-catatonic stupor and long bouts of uncontrollable crying. He was overwhelmed by the sheer mental shock,"" said Floor Nurse Susan Michelson of St. Barnabas Children's Hospital. ""By the end of his stay, however, he'd improved 110 percent, watching television all day long with a contented, blank expression on his little face, gently rocking back and forth."" ""As a matter of fact,"" she added, ""practically the only time he ever cried at all was when we'd try to turn it off."" Young Stevie's ordeal began two weeks ago, when his parents, Duane and Francine Burke, lost control of their vehicle while driving their son to daycare. According to police investigators who later reconstructed the accident, the Burkes swerved wildly when a fuel truck failed to negotiate a tight curve, jackknifing into their lane and hitting the Burkes' Honda Civic. The Burkes' car, it is believed, drove off the highway after sliding under the truck's chassis, rupturing the tanker as sparks from the collision ignited the spilling fuel. Engulfed in flames, the twisted wreckage of both vehicles plunged down a steep embankment, rolling several times and coming to a stop moments before exploding. Emergency-response teams arriving on the scene initially assumed there were no survivors. Several hours later, Stevie, in a severe state of shock, was found hiding behind a nearby log. Authorities theorize that he either was thrown from the car or somehow crawled away from the accident before the rising flames caused the secondary series of explosions. ""The worst part is, forensic evidence indicated that both parents were still conscious for several minutes before they died, meaning that Stevie could probably hear their screams of agony during the final moments. That's a hell of a lot for a small boy to bear,"" said Charles Laine, the paramedic who discovered the terrified child. ""But, thanks to TV, he's really adjusting great."" Those close to the recently orphaned boy say his favorite shows appear to be CHiPs, The Dukes Of Hazzard and Knight Rider, although he chooses ER and Chicago Hope with great regularity, as well. ""The boy was completely nonverbal. We feared the worst,"" said St. Barnabas pediatric psychologist Dr. Jameson Davies. ""Yet he has responded greatly to the television screen. The first real breakthrough occurred when he pointed at the set in his hospital room. They were showing Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the afternoon movie, I think, and he said, just out of the blue, 'Big truck go boom.' It was the first words he'd spoken in days. I knew right then that this kid was going to be okay."" Confident that Stevie was showing marked signs of improvement, doctors released him into the custody of his closest living relative, great-aunt Maureen Knabholz, with whom he has continued to find solace in television's therapeutic effects. ""Steven is only four, so normally I'd say, 'Only two hours a day, and no HBO.' But after all he's been through, I figured I'd forget the rules and just let him watch what he wants,"" Knabholz said. ""Yesterday, I even let him stay up late to watch The Road Warrior on Cinemax. When he sees something he likes, his little eyes get so big and wide… I just don't have the heart to say no. Considering that I have to work at the supermarket all day and don't have much time to spend time with him, that TV has really been a godsend for the boy."" ""It is so wonderful to see something like this come along and really make a difference in a child's life,"" Knabholz added. ""On my limited income, I can only afford to keep him here until a suitable foster home can be found, but I'm really going to miss him once he's gone. He's something special."" Citizens throughout the Mason City area agree that Burke is a remarkable boy, and they're making every effort to show it. Touched by Burke's recovery, local businesses have donated more than $3,300 in goods and services to Stevie's cause. Blauvelt Electronics donated a state-of-the-art wide-screen projection television in an effort to help meet Stevie's TV-watching needs, and Global Tetrahedron Cable has offered a year of free cable, including premium channels and pay-per-view. ""It's a sad story, but luckily for Stevie, it has a happy ending,"" said Geoff Jarman, vice-president of Mason City NBC affiliate KMSC. ""We all need someone to lean on. Television has opened its heart to this young child, and it's really made an impact. He'll never be the same."""

Doctors Give Area Man Six Months To Pay,8/04/99,4084,"CARBONDALE, IL—Doctors at Southern Illinois Hospital confirmed Monday that Dale Monfort, a 39-year-old lymphatic-cancer sufferer who underwent emergency surgery last week, has just six months to pay. ""Breaking that kind of news to a patient is never easy,"" said Dr. Albert Sutin, who performed the six-hour, $30,840 procedure to remove a malignant mass in one of Monfort's lymph nodes. ""To look a man in the face and tell him he's got, at the very most, half a year to get his affairs in order, well, it's one of the toughest things a doctor has to do."" In total, Monfort's operation and five-day hospital stay cost $44,172.46, with full payment due no later than Jan. 30, 2000. ""At first, his outlook seemed excellent,"" Sutin said. ""But when Mr. Monfort's results tal came back from the billing department, we were forced to change our assessment of his financial condition."" ""As soon as we opened up his file, we saw it—a recent job change had left him without active health insurance for the month of August,"" Sutin said. ""Quite frankly, at that point, we knew there was little we could do to help him."" Unable to halt the uncontrolled growth of the bill, doctors referred Monfort to Marlene Davidoff, head of the hospital's renowned FlexPay program. Upon reviewing his records, Smith estimated that there is only a 10 percent chance his already-depleted bank accounts would be able to handle the massive withdrawals necessary in the final stages of repayment. ""Unfortunately, I don't see much hope,"" Davidoff said. ""If he were a young, physically active, non-smoking lawyer or investment banker, then I'd say he'd have a good shot at beating this. But a between-jobs high-school guidance counselor? You just don't see those types recovering from this sort of thing."" Monfort, who has a long family history of billing problems, said he ""immediately knew something was wrong by the look on the specialist's face."" ""These doctors know what they're doing,"" a visibly shaken Monfort said. ""They don't usually send in their top payment counselor to talk to a financially healthy man. The second I saw him, I knew they'd discovered something terribly wrong deep within my body of credit."" Monfort, who has been hemorrhaging funds ever since he was diagnosed with cancer on May 11, was immediately placed within the hospital's high-risk group. The billing department is not planning to enlist the assistance of a credit-reconstruction specialist, however, saying that in light of Monfort's already failing financial health, it would not be worth the risk. In the meantime, Monfort has been tying up loose ends, using what precious little time he has left to visit members of his extended family and make contact with friends he hasn't seen in years, some of whom may be able to loan him money. ""Dale's a fighter. He'll lick this thing yet,"" said Scott Roth, an old college roommate whom Monfort recently called to collect on an outstanding $200 debt from 1978. ""I'm willing to help him out as much as I can. But, ultimately, it's got to come from him."" Monfort said he is trying to put his plight into perspective and take stock of his life. ""News like this really makes you reexamine your valuables,"" Monfort said. ""It forces you to ask yourself what's really important to you and what you're willing to let go of at a garage sale."" ""In a way,"" Monfort continued, ""this has been good for me. It's made me realize just how much the little things were costing me. Things like flowers for my wife or an ice-cream cone for my daughter."" Specialists at the hospital say Monfort's positive attitude greatly increases his likelihood of payment. ""When a patient skips the 'denial' phase of coping with medical billing crises, we have a much greater chance of recovering our funds,"" said Bob Gilliam, chief financial officer at the hospital. ""What we have to watch out for now, though, is the equally dangerous 'bargaining' phase. Dale must realize that there's no getting around this. He needs to face this bill head-on, because no matter how much he wishes it would, it's not going to go away."""
"Dog Urine Lowers Heart-Attack Risk, Say Snickering Researchers",7/28/99,3556,"BALTIMORE—A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found a link between the consumption of dog urine and the decreased likelihood of heart attacks, team leaders announced Tuesday in cracking, uneven voices. ""Our research indicates that by drinking six to eight glasses of fresh dog urine per day, individuals can reduce the risk of cardiac arrest by as much as 70 percent,"" said Dr. Arnold Minton, covering his mouth with his hand. ""This abundantly available material contains magical cardio-fluxo-medicines that strengthen the heart's mitral chambers and help keep its four aortic corridors clear of toxins and other such harmful substances."" Apologizing for his occasional laughter and explaining that the morning's Hi & Lois comic strip was ""really funny,"" team member Dr. Dinesh Patel explained the origins of the six-hour study. ""I noticed that my dog had never had a heart attack, and I'd never heard of a dog having a heart attack, so I realized that there is what scientists call 'a cause-effect phenomenon' at work here,"" Patel said. ""Well, it turned out it's their urine."" Patel then ran from the podium. After being pushed to the microphone by Minton, Dr. Leonard Weiscz outlined the team's recommendations for those wishing to diminish their chance of a potentially deadly myocardial infarction: ""Get yourself a dog, ideally a Labrador retriever, as the pH level is optimal in this particular breed, and then train it to urinate into a bucket,"" Weiscz said. ""Then, when the bucket is three-quarters to four-quarters full, lift it to your mouth and chug as quickly as you can."" Weiscz then stepped down from the podium ""to examine [his] notes."" Minton said a more convenient form of the active ingredients in dog urine will likely one day be synthesized for an over-the-counter medication, but he stressed that such a breakthrough is at least 10 to 15 years down the road. ""For now, you need a dog—excuse me a moment,"" said Minton, doubling over and inhaling sharply. ""And a bucket."" According to the Johns Hopkins team, for maximum effectiveness, the urine should not be mixed with any other substance. ""Drink it straight,"" said Weiscz, wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. ""Don't mix it with anything, not even water."" The group then called for a short break in the press conference. Returning after five minutes with somber faces, the scientists revealed more of their findings, including their suggestion that the urine be consumed ""right out in public."" ""It's also important to yell out, 'Ah, that's some tasty dog pee!' as soon as you're done,"" said Minton, his chest visibly shaking. ""I should know. I'm a trained medical professional."" Turning to the panel of scientists behind him, Minton shouted, ""Shut up, you guys!"" Upon the conclusion of Minton's remarks, the floor was opened to questions. The first came from Washington Post reporter Ken Coultier, who asked the researchers to discuss their own dog-urine-consumption habits. ""I wouldn't drink dog piss,"" Patel responded. Coultier then asked the researcher to explain why, if urine reduces the risk of heart attacks, he would choose not to follow his own advice. ""I don't have to drink it,"" Patel said. ""I'm not in a high-risk group."" ""Why don't you drink some?"" added Patel before calling for an end to the question-and-answer session. Tuesday's announcement is believed to be the most significant medical breakthrough from the Johns Hopkins team since its 1997 discovery that a grape stuffed in the left nostril for 48 hours will lower blood pressure by 30 percent."
Millions and Millions Dead,6/02/99,5228,"As the body count continues to rise, a shaken nation is struggling to cope in the wake of the mass deaths sweeping the world population. With no concrete figures available at this early stage, experts estimate at least 250,000 U.S. citizens have died in the last month alone, with death tolls across the globe reaching into the millions. The wave of deaths has left a brutal aftermath, rocking survivors with feelings of loss and horror, traumatizing the American cultural landscape to its core and leaving behind emotional devastation some say may take years to heal. What's worse, experts say, the crisis shows no signs of letting up any time soon. ""Oh, my God,"" sobbed Edina, MN resident Elizabeth Kendrick, 42, whose father, retired insurance actuary Gilbert Ploman, 68, lost his life last Thursday at Shady Villa Nursing Home. ""He was a good man, a kind man who never did anything to deserve this terrible fate. Why did something like this have to happen? Oh, God, why?"" As wrenching as Kendrick's grief is, she is just one of the countless Americans who feel the anguish that continues to tear the country apart. Across the nation, in millions of homes in thousands of cities, similar scenes played out, as survivors gathered to mourn, pray, and somehow pick up the pieces while attempting to make sense of it all. In Fargo, ND, Tom Blake, 89, attended the funeral of his wife Edith, who died of a brain tumor Thursday night. In Augusta, ME, family members broke down in tears, overwhelmed by news of the hang-gliding death of 26-year-old outdoorsman Lance Blaine. And in Cicero, IL, no explanations could comfort the family of accidental auto-erotic-asphyxiation victim Bob Carpenter. Everywhere, those left behind comforted each other as best they could, looking for some kind of hope. ""This epidemic knows no bounds, follows no common denominators, and crosses all demographic lines without impunity,"" said Harvard University's Gregory Jameson. ""Although senior citizens and the terminally ill have seemed to suffer the most casualties, this syndrome does not discriminate. Rich and poor, young and old, people of all races, creeds and backgrounds imaginable have succumbed to its relentless advance."" ""We are, all of us, at risk,"" Jameson said, ""and medical science is powerless to stop it."" As devastating as the crisis is here at home, it may be worse overseas. World Health Organization officials are reporting similar death rates across the globe, with widespread casualties reported from as far away as Somalia, Borneo, Brazil, Malaysia and Luxembourg. In the wake of such suffering, there is no way to adequately explain the tragedy. Yet the seemingly random nature of the mass deaths has made them even harder for the survivors to understand. ""In a situation like this, it's only natural to want to assign blame,"" said Dr. Frederick MacDougal of the National Center for Infectious Diseases, who recently lost a third cousin to a degenerative nerve disorder. ""But the disturbing thing about this case is that no one factor is at fault. People are dying for such a wide range of reasons—gunshot wounds, black-lung disease, falls down elevator shafts—that we have been unable to isolate any single element as the cause."" ""No one simple explanation can encompass the enormous scope of this problem,"" MacDougal added. ""And that's very difficult for most people to process psychologically."" As experts continue to struggle for a solution, the nation is left to cope with the crisis one day at a time. But as it stands, the death rate is so high that most of the resources of the world's funeral homes are being called upon to deal with the vast quantities of bodies. Virtually every mortician in the nation is currently employed in some capacity to meet the demand, and more corpses are arriving daily. The cost of the non-stop interments exceeds billions of dollars each year. As more people succumb each day, hospitals and doctors are finding themselves on 24-hour call. Taxed to the limit, the nation's health-care infrastructure is proving inadequate to handle the needs of sick and dying patients. And though sales of health aides and pharmaceuticals have skyrocketed, nothing has stemmed the tide. Despite efforts to keep pace with the death toll, for now, all the nation can do is watch and wait. Since the crisis began, a vast majority of Americans have lost at least one family member, close friend, co-worker, distant relative, neighbor or peripheral acquaintance, or know someone who has. Yet even for the lucky few who remain unscathed, the fear remains. ""Our family has been spared so far, but for how long?"" asked mother of four Karen Beemis, of Scottsdale, AZ. ""Every night I lay awake in bed worrying and thinking, 'This is going to get one of us someday, too. Who will be the first? Grandma? Grandpa? My great-uncle Ted in Michigan?' There's just no way of knowing."" Meanwhile, as the world continues to grapple with this seemingly unstoppable threat, the deaths—and the sorrow, fear and pain they have wrought—continue. As Margaret Heller, a volunteer at a clinic in Baltimore put it, ""We do everything we can. But for most of the people we try to help, the sad truth is it's only a matter of time."""
Local Man Puts Rehab Behind Him,5/19/99,433,"SAN FRANCISCO—After a harrowing three-year battle with drug-addiction recovery, area resident Scott Fedorisko finally put rehab behind him Monday.

National Pork Council: Many Americans Suffer From Pork Deficiency,3/24/99,576,"DES MOINES, IA—An alarming study released Tuesday by the National Pork Producers Council reports that fewer than 5 percent of Americans get the NPPC recommended daily allowance of pork. ""An overwhelming majority of Americans aren't getting the dietary pork they need for healthy muscles and proper digestion,"" read the NPPC study. ""What's worse, many growing children who could be helped by as little as two strips of bacon a day are getting no pork at all."" The NPPC recommends that adults eat at least nine servings of pork per day from the bacon, ham, chop and rind groups."
New Study Finds College Binge Drinking To Be A Blast,3/24/99,4542,"AMHERST, MA—Researchers at the University of Massachusetts released a surprising new study Monday indicating that, contrary to long-held beliefs about its destructive effects, collegiate binge drinking is a fucking blast. ""Data collected at bars and fraternity parties on the UMass campus has yielded unexpected conclusions with regard to the practice of binge drinking,"" study head Dr. Albert Greaves said. ""Over the course of our research, a consistent pattern emerged demonstrating that binge drinking seriously kicks ass."" ""There was this one bar called The Depot, where they serve beer in these humongous three-foot glasses that are like giant boots,"" Greaves continued. ""You have to stand back and tilt the thing to drink it all. Our team conducted an experiment to see who could finish one off the fastest. Myself, Dr. Milton Laurian and these eight 20-year-old test subjects lined up against a wall and started chugging away. After completing the test and subsequently throwing up all over the place, I could only conclude that downing huge-ass boot beers is really awesome."" Added Greaves: ""That was the best fucking study."" The 250-page report comes as a surprise to the many medical researchers who had previously found binge drinking to have a host of negative effects. A 1996 Johns Hopkins University study concluded that binge drinking is a destructive scourge on college campuses that can lead to alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual assault and alcohol poisoning. But in the wake of the UMass study, the Johns Hopkins researchers and others have been forced to revise their conclusions. ""It appears that our study would have benefited greatly from first-hand observation of the binge-drinking phenomenon,"" said Dr. Caroline Worsted of Johns Hopkins. ""Our failure to go out and collect primary data at bars and off-campus house parties until all hours of the night skewed our findings, preventing us from accurately measuring just how much fun it is to get ripped."" According to Greaves, much of the UMass team's research was conducted at a party at this one guy Matt's place. ""My colleagues and I were doing beer bongs, keg-stands, Jell-O shots, Jager shots—you name it,"" Greaves said. ""We were totally binge drinking and just having a great fucking time. The best part was the crowd—the study was packed, and there was this amazing random sampling of hot chicks. I was so drunk, I couldn't figure out what the source of the unusually large hot-chick sample was, but by that point, I really didn't care."" When the keg was tapped, Greaves and his team went looking for a place to gather more data. ""We heard there was this awesome study on Church Street, but we didn't have the address, so we just went wandering around,"" Greaves said. ""We eventually wound up walking into this complete other study where we didn't know anyone. Unfortunately, it turned out to be totally lame—most of the people there were in the non-drinking control group. We had fun for a little while busting on them, but pretty soon we split."" Among the UMass team's findings: A 10-ounce serving of Jack Daniels can be consumed 30 percent faster when accompanied by shouts of ""Go! Go! Go! Go!""; the bathroom at The Lightning Lounge is a popular place to throw up; and when Dr. Andrew Schmid drinks five Long Island iced teas, he lies down in the street and starts singing the chorus to The Dream Academy's ""Life In A Northern Town"" at the top of his lungs. ""Dr. Schmid is what we scientists term a fucking booze monster,"" team member Dr. James Podriewski said. ""This one time, we needed a whole bunch of Wild Turkey and tonic water for a study that was just getting going at midnight, so we sent him out to this store that's open until 2 a.m., and we're waiting for, like, hours until he finally comes back, and he doesn't have any of the stuff, but he's carrying this big fucking railroad-crossing sign, and he's all like, 'Guys, check out the sign I found.' It was funny as shit. I swear, I was laughing so hard, I almost left a urine sample all over my pants."" Podriewski, addressing reporters in front of a massive pyramid of empty laboratory beakers, called the study ""a major success."" ""That was seriously the best study I've ever done,"" Podriewski said. ""I don't know what those New England Journal Of Medicine people were talking about when they did that 1996 study in conjunction with the Department of Education that found binge drinking to be even more dangerous and destructive than previously believed. As far as I could tell, binge drinking rules."""

Revlon Forced To Test Cosmetics On Plants,3/03/99,2018,"NEW YORK—Bowing to pressure from PETA and other activist groups to abandon animal testing, the Revlon Corporation announced Tuesday that, effective immediately, all new products will be tested on plant life. ""Before any Revlon product is placed in the hands of U.S. consumers, I can assure you that it will have been thoroughly safety-tested on a wide range of flora,"" said Angelique Christopher, a spokesperson for the cosmetics giant. ""No lipstick, eyeliner, eye shadow, blush, concealer, foundation, mascara, nail polish or makeup remover will hit store shelves without first being put through a rigorous battery of on-plant tests."" Christopher concluded her remarks by pouring a bottle of Revlon Intense Therapy nail conditioner on a fern. Under the new program, the mice, rabbits, pigs and monkeys that for decades were a staple of product-testing will be replaced with poinsettias, African violets, philodendrons and cacti. ""To determine whether our new Revlon SureHold hair spray is safe for human use, we will take a rhododendron, remove it from its natural soil-based environment, and strap it into a leather restraining harness,"" Revlon researcher Warren Gilbride said. ""The plant's leaves will then be scraped raw and soaked in SureHold, and the spray will be injected into its stem and poured into its flowers. The effect of this treatment on the overall health and well-being of the plant will be meticulously recorded, and the product's likely effect on humans will be extrapolated from the results."" Added Gilbride: ""A plant's stamen is remarkably similar to the human eye."" With Tuesday's announcement, Revlon joins a growing list of corporations turning to plants as an alternative to animal testing. For years, Bristol-Myers Squibb has tried out its new drugs on philodendrons. Since May 1998, Benjamin Moore has tested for toxicity in its paints by placing fume-filled gas masks over English ivys. And just last week, the Chrysler Corporation announced it would begin using geraniums in crash tests."

Loved Ones Recall Local Man's Cowardly Battle With Cancer,2/24/99,4516,"On Jan. 26, just four days after visiting the doctor for what he thought was severe indigestion or maybe an ulcer, Russ Kunkel got the dreaded news: A malignant, fist-sized tumor had metastasized between his stomach and liver. It was cancer. Right then and there, faced with the prospect of a life-threatening disease, the 34-year-old Florissant, MO, husband and father of three drew a deep breath and made a firm resolution to himself: I am not going to fight this. I am a dead man. On Feb. 20, less than a month after he was first diagnosed, Kunkel died following a brief, cowardly battle with stomach cancer. ""Most people, when they find out they've got something terrible like this, dig deep down inside and tap into some tremendous well of courage and strength they never knew they had,"" said Judith Kunkel, Russ' wife of 11 years. ""Not Russ. The moment he found out he had cancer, he curled up into a fetal ball and sobbed uncontrollably for three straight weeks."" Said Judith: ""I can still remember Russ' last words: 'Oh, God—I'm going to die! Why, God, why? Why me? Why not someone else?'"" According to Russ' personal physician, Dr. James Wohlpert, the type of cancer Russ had generally takes at least four months to advance to the terminal stage. But because of what he described as a ""remarkable lack of fighting spirit,"" the disease consumed him in less than one. ""It's rare that you see someone give up that quickly and completely,"" Wohlpert said. ""Cancer is a powerful disease, but most people can at the very least delay the spread of it by maintaining a positive outlook and mental attitude. This, however, was not the case with Russ."" Russ' friends and acquaintances saw that same lack of fighting spirit. ""Russ did not go quietly, that's for sure,"" said longtime friend Bobby Dwyer. ""He did a tremendous amount of screaming."" ""During the three days he spent at work before the pain got too bad, I saw a very different Russ,"" said Arnold Tolliver, a co-worker at the Florissant electronics store where Russ had been employed for the past six years. ""He was always telling the customers how tragic it was that he wouldn't outlive his kids, reminding me that every day is a gift cruelly torn from his fingers, and grabbing somebody, anybody, by the shirt and screaming into their face that he didn't want to die."" In those final days, like so many who realize their day of reckoning is near, Russ Kunkel turned to a higher power. ""Russ came to me in his time of need,"" said Pastor Charles Bourne of Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church. ""But when I tried to comfort him by saying he would be with God soon, he only stopped bawling long enough to say, 'Fuck God. There is no God.' I had to get a couple acolytes to help me pry him out from underneath the pews."" When the end finally came, Russ Kunkel died red-eyed, trembling and hysterical in the attic of his home, where, in the depths of his fear, he was convinced the Reaper would look last. On that day, his 5-year-old daughter Bailey awoke to an unnerving quiet, the usual terror-choked sobs and shrieks of her father strangely absent from the morning air. Alarmed, she ran to her mother's side. ""Bailey was yelling, 'Daddy stopped crying! Daddy stopped crying!'"" Judith said. ""Somehow, though she's still very young, she understood."" On Monday, Russ Kunkel was laid to rest at Shady Grove Cemetery in Florissant. More than 200 people gathered to bid farewell. And just as Russ had requested shortly before his death, the funeralgoers wailed loudly and gnashed their teeth, cursing the heavens for the unfair hand dealt their loved one. ""The day before Russ died,"" Judith recalled, ""he took my hand and said to me, 'At my funeral, I don't want people to wear bright colors and smile and laugh fondly at the wonderful memories of the precious time we spent together on Earth. Tell them to wear black and cover their faces with ash. Tell them to weep bitter tears and rail angrily against the cruel God who took me at so young an age. Do this for me, my beloved.'"" Added Judith: ""He also told me not to move on from this tragedy by one day finding love in the arms of another. He said he couldn't bear the thought of me with someone else, and that the best way I could honor his memory was by never building a new life for myself."" ""They say it is in times of great trial that a man's true colors show,"" said Russ' best friend, Larry Ahrens, summing up the feelings of those who knew the man. ""And in Russ' case, he had a yellow streak a mile wide."""
Christopher Cross Finally Reaches Mexican Border,2/10/99,431,"NOGALES, MEXICO—After nearly 20 years on the run, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Christopher Cross finally reached the Mexican border Monday.

Doctors, who described Cross' body as ""weak,"" said much sleep would be necessary to restore the health of the fugitive adult-contemporary vocalist."
Study: Sniffing Glue Proven Effective In Treatment Of Adolescent Boredom,2/03/99,4737,"BOSTON—A groundbreaking study released Monday by the American Medical Association, conducted in conjunction with the National Organization of Craft and Hobby Retailers, finds that repeated exposure to glue fumes and other industrial chemicals ""may prove to be our most effective weapon yet in the fight against teen boredom."" Though ABS (Adolescent Boredom Syndrome), a debilitating condition that afflicts an estimated 90 percent of Americans between the ages of 11 and 17, has long been regarded by the medical community as incurable, the study reported that ""significant reductions in teen-boredom levels"" were observed in youths who regularly self-administered concentrated doses of airplane glue and other solvents. ""It's a tremendous breakthrough,"" said Dr. Gerald Osgood, the report's co-author. ""This could be the most significant development since the 1973 discovery that aerosol whipped-cream canisters can get you really high."" Glue fumes, which can cause light-headedness, dizziness, incoherence and involuntary loss of muscle control, have for years been dismissed by model-airplane hobbyists as an unpleasant side-effect of working in poorly ventilated areas. However, the AMA/NOCHR study found that such fumes, when used as part of a regular fume-inhalation regimen, can have a powerful psychoactive effect, easing the painful boredom of American life for millions of post-pubescents with nothing better to do. ""I hate school, I hate chores, I hate my stupid family, and everything on TV bites, so what's left?"" asked Mesa, AZ, 16-year-old Doug Weineke, one of 1,700 ABS sufferers who participated in the study. ""Me and my friends used to get so bored, we'd drive down to the parking lot of Arby's and just stand around."" ""Talk about your thrilling excursions,"" added Weineke, displaying the telltale ""sarcasm"" side-effect long associated with ABS. ""But now that we've discovered glue-sniffing, all that's changed. We figure, there's nothing to do in this stupid town anyway, so why not huff fumes from a paper sack until we pass out in my dad's garage? It's not like he gives a crap one way or the other. All he cares about is his stupid job at the tile store."" Adolescent boredom, the leading cause of surliness in teenage males and the third most common cause of unwanted pregnancy in females under the age of 16, has baffled doctors for decades. As recently as 1997, medical researchers almost universally regarded the condition as incurable. Yet, according to the new report, even a small quantity of glue, when inhaled, can alleviate many of the most debilitating effects of adolescent boredom, including introspection, awareness of the passage of time, and consciousness. ""The glue worked great—I hadn't felt so little boredom in years, mainly because I wasn't aware of my surroundings, peers or self,"" said study participant Ryan Jenkins, 14. ""The only downside was, when I woke up behind the Dumpster, like a couple hours later or something, I had this splitting headache. Oh, and somebody stole my shoes. But other than that, it was the bomb."" Though the report has sent shockwaves through the medical community, its findings come as no surprise to the millions of Americans who for years have been employing fume-based boredom-alleviation techniques as a sort of ""home remedy"" homeopathic cure. Such longtime proponents agree that it's about time the medical establishment finally caught on. ""All the kids want to sniff some glue,"" said Joseph Ramone, a leading glue-sniffing advocate since the mid-'70s. ""Why? Because they want to have something to do."" While Ramone praised the study as ""a step in the right direction,"" he stressed that it does not go far enough. ""After more than two decades of self-administering glue fumes—not to mention epoxies, aerosol sprays, acrylic adhesives, silicone resins, methacrylates, contact cements, urethanes, polyurethanes and hot melts—I know from experience that glue-huffing is an effective tool in the fight against adolescent boredom, as well as many other kinds of boredom,"" Ramone said, ""including, for example, post-adolescent, early-20s, mid-20s, post-mid-20s, pre-mid-30s, mid-30s, late-30s, middle-age, and late-middle-age boredom."" Despite such praise, the treatment is not without its detractors. ""My science teacher said it's destroying my higher brain functions, and that someday I could get permanent brain damage if I didn't stop,"" said Morgantown, WV, ABS sufferer Timothy Keck, 13, who was recently prescribed 12 fluid ounces of Glu-Tek model-airplane glue by his family physician. ""But I just told him, 'Oh yeah, Mr. Hammaker? Well, listening to you talk about stupid protozoa and shit all day long would give anybody permanent brain damage, so there.'"""
Area Man May Never Find Out If Condom In Wallet Is Still Good,2/03/99,680,"OMAHA, NE—Donald Muller, a 33-year-old Omaha near-virgin, may never find out if the Ramses Extra Sensitive condom in his wallet is still good, it was reported Monday. ""I really hope it hasn't deteriorated in the past three years,"" Muller said of the birth-control device, which was first inserted into his wallet in March 1996, prior to a St. Patrick's Day party that ""didn't pan out."" ""I don't really have any particularly strong leads right now, but it'd be nice to know I was prepared just in case anything came up."" Muller, who bought the condom in 1993 as part of a box of 12, said he hopes to strike up a conversation Sunday with a woman who uses the same laundromat as him."
New High-Viscosity Mayonnaise To Aid In American Swallowing,11/18/98,4087,"ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, NJ–The act of swallowing will soon be easier for millions of food-shoveling Americans, thanks to QX-1, a revolutionary new high-viscosity/low-friction mayonnaise developed by scientists at Hellmann's. The mayonnaise, which received FDA approval Monday and is set to hit the nation's shelves early next month, utilizes special lubricant additives and anti-breakdown agents to help keep America's high-intake gullets running smoothly and efficiently. ""Americans' high-load, high-capacity eating puts a tremendous amount of stress on the alimentary canal,"" Hellmann's mayochemical engineer Gerald Lund said. ""Often, when the canal is overtaxed, it can 'seize up,' resulting in choking and, in some cases, total eater breakdown. QX-1 was formulated with today's harder-working ingestion in mind."" According to Lund, QX-1 smooths food intake by forming a protective barrier between typical fist-sized food chunks and the delicate moving parts of digestive tracts, enabling American eaters to wolf down food at a rate long believed prohibitively dangerous. ""Americans equipped with QX-1 will able to eat longer, faster and harder,"" Lund said. ""When you're absolutely stuffed, but you've got to somehow cram that last turkey leg into your food-packed maw, cover it with a generous coat of QX-1. QX-1 gives you the edge you need."" Before ingesting extra-large food items, Lund recommended that eaters also squeeze a liberal amount of QX-1 down their throats. ""In laboratory tests conducted by Hellmann's scientists, test eaters whose throats were pre-coated with QX-1 were able to accommodate chocolate eclairs with a diameter 150 percent greater than that of their esophagi,"" Lund said. ""Even more impressive, because QX-1's compound polymayonic structure can withstand an extremely high gradient of temperature and pressure, test eaters were able to swallow entire unmasticated six-pound pork roasts straight out of the oven."" ""In another test,"" Lund said, ""we filled a dozen two-gallon-capacity bowls with delicious tuna salad, one made with QX-1 mayonnaise and the other 11 with competing low-viscosity brands. We then gave 12 hungry Americans large ladles and directed them to begin eating the tuna salad without chewing, just as they would at home. All the eaters seized up and suffered internal stress breakdowns after 30 seconds, with the exception of the QX-1 user, who was still shoveling it in 15 minutes later. That's high-performance mayo."" In addition to facilitating the intake of food, QX-1 aids in its outtake, helping food slide through the intestines and out the rectum as easily as it entered. And QX-1's specially formulated synthetic lubricants coat the walls of the stomach, promoting clean burning and reducing toxic emissions. ""What's more,"" Lund said, ""QX-1 helps carry away the harmful particles–such as sesame seeds, chicken bones and plastic-fork tines–that can cause major wear and tear on heavy-duty eaters."" Hellmann's officials said the new product was developed in response to the nation's dwindling Chews-Per-Bite Ratio. ""Twenty years ago, the typical American chewed his food 30 times before swallowing,"" Hellmann's vice-president of product development Christopher McCue said. ""Since then, the average number of chews per bite has fallen to a mere 2.6. Our projections indicate that by 2010, chewing will disappear altogether. Clearly, a product had to be developed to address this."" QX-1 is earning raves from gluttons across the U.S. ""Before, I could barely eat four chili cheese dogs in a single sitting,"" said 377-pound Dennis Luedtke of Phoenix, one of 25 test markets for the new product. ""But with Hellmann's QX-1, I can easily ram down eight."" ""From barbecued ribs to fried funnel cakes, I never stuff my face without first slathering Hellmann's QX-1 high-viscosity mayo all down my gullet,"" said Johnson City, TN, eater JoAnne Durbin, enjoying a mayonnaise-covered steak burrito. ""And the patented E-Z Pour spout makes it easy to hit those hard-to-reach spots behind the tongue. QX-1 is the brand I trust for all my gorging needs."""
Study: U.S. Pets' Healthcare Better Than Rwandan Humans',11/04/98,3203,"PHILADELPHIA–A University of Pennsylvania study released Monday found that U.S. pets enjoy superior healthcare to that of Rwandan humans. The five-year study, which compared the medical care of 2,500 U.S. dogs, cats, hamsters and parakeets to that of 2,500 humans in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, found that the Rwandans were edged out in every category. ""America's pet lovers can rejoice knowing that their precious, furry companions are well taken care of,"" study co-chair Dr. Nate Gotcher said. Among the good news for U.S. animals: America has 15 veterinarians per 1,000 dogs, compared to Rwanda's one doctor per 1,000 humans. The infant-mortality rate among U.S. cats is 7 per 1,000 live births, compared to 119 per 1,000 live births among Rwandan humans. ""When the infection started to spread to my upper leg, they had to amputate,"" said Rwandan Kasongo Tshikapa, whose left leg was removed in May 1997 after he stepped on a piece of rusted scrap metal. ""The surgery took five hours, and there was no anesthesia. The operation was performed by my brother-in-law, who has experience as a carpenter. Eight men had to hold me down."" Added Tshikapa: ""If only I were a border collie in America."" According to Dr. Wendy Hentrich of the American Association of Veterinary Medicine, new breakthroughs in animal medicine are being made every day. ""The last few years have seen so many exciting advances in high-tech health care for pets,"" said Hentrich, also chief of cardiology at UCLA's Veterinary Hospital. ""For example, at UCLA, we've developed a balloon angioplasty technique that can open a cat's deformed cardiac valves. A catheter is passed into the deformed valve, then a balloon is inflated, allowing blood to pass more freely. This painless, revolutionary procedure has already been used to save the lives of thousands of beautiful, lovable cats."" Such breakthroughs, along with advances in the prevention of diseases like feline leukemia, have caused the average life expectancy of U.S. cats to rise to 18.6 years, which, when converted to human years, is substantially higher than the Rwandan life expectancy of 38.8. ""If I do not have medicine soon, I will die,"" said Ndola Iringa, who contracted malaria five weeks ago during an outbreak of the disease in her village. ""My sister and three of my brothers have died already. The convulsions are getting worse."" As a result of the study, Rwandan physicians are beginning to look toward U.S. petcare policy for ways to improve their own healthcare system. ""In America, many dog foods contain nutritional supplements for healthy teeth and gums, as well as a lustrous, glowing coat,"" Rwandan physician Mbeya Liwale said. ""Perhaps such supplements, if they could somehow be found here in Rwanda, could be put to use reducing the death tolls brought on by mass famine and genocide."" ""I just don't know what I would do without my Muffin,"" said Palo Alto, CA, resident Gloria Shifrin, whose 6-year-old Welsh corgi had a grapefruit-sized tumor removed from her chest Monday and must undergo five weeks of chemotherapy. ""But, thank God, the cancer is in remission, and it looks like she's going to be all right. No dog should have to go through this."""
Doctors Find New Way To Prolong Meaningless Existence,9/02/98,4110,"ITHACA, NY–In a stunning medical breakthrough, a team of Cornell University biogeneticists announced Tuesday that it has developed a revolutionary new synthetic hormone that retards the human aging process, enabling individuals to extend the churning, meaningless void known as life by upwards of 20 years. ""This remarkable new hormone will enable millions of people to live longer, healthier lives,"" said Dr. Marlene Peretz-Worthington, head of the Cornell team. ""Once the substance wins FDA approval and is made available to the general public, the hellish emptiness of our spiritually blank lives should be that much more inescapable."" According to Peretz-Worthington, between 1990 and 1998, 250 test subjects between the ages of 68 and 81 were injected bi-weekly with Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase, an experimental DNA-modifying hormone that ""freezes"" the genetic codes that regulate aging. In all 250 subjects, the drug slowed down the aging process by at least 30 percent, adding years to their futile, purposeless existences. In addition to retarding aging, Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase has proven effective in fighting disease. Experts cited the example of Gus Dermott, a Charlotte, NC, dockworker whose nightmarishly empty life of grueling menial labor nearly ended when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's Disease. When administered high doses of the hormone over a seven-month period, Dermott showed such rapid improvement that doctors now estimate he will be able to return to his soul-crushing, spiritually hollow toil within as little as three months. ""I was bedridden, just waiting to die,"" Dermott told reporters. ""But now, they tell me I can go back to that same dock where I've already wasted almost 20 years of my life, and waste the rest of it while waiting to die there instead."" Gertrude Anne Klingbell, an 89-year-old Alzheimer's Disease sufferer from Shaker Heights, OH, had equally miraculous results using the hormone. ""I used to be blissfully unaware of my pathetic, pitiable state,"" said Klingbell, whose Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase treatments have restored her mental faculties. ""Now, the doctors say I can live on without any purpose whatsoever for years, trapped helplessly within the bleak prison of shattered dreams and blasted hopes that has been my life."" According to Cornell's Dr. Sunil Gupta, Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase also has applications in treating cancer. ""The cancer patients who participated in our study expressed a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, not only over the disease, but the horrifying awareness of the random injustice of the world that contracting the disease instilled in them,"" Gupta said. ""Now, that sense of misery in the face of an uncaring universe can be stretched out over many years of grueling family crisis, despair, painful chemotherapy and surgery, instead of mere months."" Despite its early successes, Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase has yet to be proven effective in fighting some life-threatening diseases, diseases which still may offer us eternal respite from the screaming vortex of unending blankness that defines the human condition. But as medical science continues its pointless fight to indefinitely prolong the existential void of modern life, the revolutionary new hormone represents the most promising development in years. ""Thanks to Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase, the wasteland just got a little bigger,"" said American Medical Association executive director Dr. Gordon Puhl. ""We're all very excited about the new drug and its potential to imprison patients–even if only for a few more desperate, agonizing years–in lives they can make no sense of, see no point in, and find no worthwhile purpose for. As we slowly learn to accept that our pretensions to relevance and meaning are but so many fragile, illusory constructs which crumble like sandcastles in the face of the universe's utter indifference to our plight, one thing is certain: Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase and other such medical advances will ensure that, for each of us, young and old alike, terminally or mildly ill, our suffering is far from over."""
Report: Americans Receive Majority Of Vitamins Through Hair,8/26/98,2679,"BOSTON–A report published in the Aug. 25 issue of The New England Journal Of Medicine indicates that the average American receives 87 percent of his or her daily vitamin intake through the hair. ""Over the past five years, the field of hair-nutrient technology has evolved at a stunning rate,"" said Dr. Irving Kallberg, follicular nutritionist and author of the report. ""Not surprisingly, shampoo has now surpassed food as the primary source of vitamins for the vast majority of U.S. citizens."" According to Kallberg, a single quarter-ounce application of a high-vitamin shampoo like Clairol's Herbal Essences or Pantene Pro-V provides a full day's supply of Vitamins A, B, C, D and E, as well as minerals like calcium, zinc and magnesium. By supplementing shampoo use with a quality revitalizing conditioner like Aussie Hair Salad, Kallberg said, the user can meet all of his or her nutritional needs. ""A serving of Paul Mitchell shampoo contains more protein than a 14-ounce New York strip steak,"" Kallberg said. ""And, unlike meat, Paul Mitchell products give your hair a healthy, radiant shine."" ""I wash my hair at least six times a day,"" said Robert Meader, a self-described ""health nut"" from Hermosa Beach, CA. ""I used to be a vegetarian, but now I'm on a strict daily regimen of Nexus Protein-Plus shampoo and Aveda clarifying rinse. And you know what? I've never felt better."" Across the U.S., restaurants are jumping on the bandwagon, offering patrons a wide selection of hair-care treatments along with their meals. Said Denny's vice-president of operations Ken St. Croix: ""We currently offer a $9.99 meal deal featuring choice of entree with soup, shampoo, salad, rinse, potato, conditioner, choice of beverage and blow-dry, with dessert and styling gel available for $2 extra."" Food manufacturers are getting into the act, as well. Campbell's is developing a line of deep-cleansing and conditioning soups. Spokespersons for Chef Boyardee said the company has an anti-dandruff ravioli in the works. And Gatorade is planning a September rollout for its new line of ""Sport-Sheen"" athletic shampoos, which promise to ""replace the vital carbohydrates and electrolytes your hair loses during exercise."" Experts say the trend is only beginning. ""With fatty, empty-calorie-laden Big Macs and pizzas becoming the norm, Americans' reliance on hair-washings for their basic nutritional needs will only increase,"" said New York University dietitian Penny Raskin. ""By 2005, the family dinner hour will be all but obsolete, replaced by the family shower."" ""Basically,"" Raskin said, ""the secret to good health is simple: regular exercise, plenty of sleep and a good pH-balanced diet."""
"Lilith Fair Performers, Attendees Achieve Largest-Ever Synchronized Ovulation",8/26/98,2730,"SALT LAKE CITY, UT–In what is believed to be the largest group ovulation in history, more than 20,000 Lilith Fair performers and attendees simultaneously released ova into their uteruses Tuesday. The collective egg-release, which took place at 11:24 p.m. MST, capped off a five-hour concert featuring such nurturing, supportive female artists as Paula Cole, Shawn Colvin, Natalie Merchant, and Lilith Fair founder Sarah McLachlan. ""This mass ovulation is a celebration of our fertility. It's a celebration of our sisterhood,"" said McLachlan, her uterine wall lined with nutrient-rich blood. ""By releasing these eggs, we recognize and honor our collective femininity."" Singer Joan Osborne, who joined McLachlan in a duet of the McLachlan hit ""Sweet Surrender"" following the historic ovulation, called the experience ""the most affirming of my life."" ""The energy radiated by everyone on stage and in the crowd was exhilarating. As a woman, I felt totally empowered,"" said Osborne, whose 1997 song ""One Of Us"" spent six weeks at the top of the charts. ""My fallopian tubes are glowing."" According to McLachlan, the synchronized ovulation, sponsored by Volkswagen, Starbucks and Bioré Pore Cleansing Strips, was successful because of the ""incredibly supportive atmosphere"" of the concert. ""Everyone at the show was surrounded by other women who understand what they go through on a daily basis in this society,"" McLachlan said. ""Knowing you have that kind of strong support system around you makes it that much easier to ovulate."" Among the other artists who participated in the historic egg-release: Suzanne Vega, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls, Sheryl Crow, Meredith Brooks, Erykah Badu and Jewel. ""To me, this is what Lilith Fair all about,"" Saliers said. ""To be able to get up on that stage and imbed an ovum in your uterus in front of 20,000 screaming, fertile fans who are doing the same thing, well, that's just the ultimate."" ""I've never been around so many people who share my interest in women's issues and social justice,"" Jewel said. ""It makes me want to ride my horse bareback through a forest stream."" Fans were equally excited. ""Without a doubt, that was the best concert I've ever been to,"" said Rebecca Roth of Ogden, UT, wearing her $27 ""I Ovulated At Lilith Fair"" souvenir T-shirt. ""The Indigo Girls and Sheryl Crow and Natalie Merchant were all so amazing. And Sarah [McLachlan] looked beautiful. I have to get that skirt she was wearing."" ""I am going to be so sad when I menstruate my egg,"" fellow concertgoer Angela Hiller of Provo, UT, said. ""I totally wish I could keep it inside me forever as a reminder of this special day."" The Lilith Fair tour concludes Aug. 31 in Vancouver, British Columbia."
Man Receives First-Ever Mouse-Heart Transplant,8/19/98,2230,"MILWAUKEE, WI–In the first operation of its kind, doctors at St. Luke's Medical Center successfully transplanted a mouse heart into a human Tuesday. Hospital officials are calling the procedure ""a complete success."" ""The patient is recuperating nicely,"" chief cardiologist Dr. Alex Sutin told reporters. ""We are confident he will be able to enjoy a long, happy life, just as long as he doesn't overexert himself by, say, attempting to walk."" The patient, 58-year-old Beloit, WI, bus driver Raymond Calvecchia, was diagnosed last month with a rare degenerative heart condition known as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. He was not expected to live another eight weeks without a donor heart, Sutin said. ""We searched every database for a suitable human donor,"" said Sutin, who performed the groundbreaking operation, ""but none could be found. In the end, we decided to go with a compatible mouse."" ""Mice have very clear arteries,"" Sutin noted. Though the nine-hour procedure was ultimately successful, some difficulties arose during surgery. ""We ran into problems when it came time to graft Mr. Calvecchia's aorta onto the organ,"" Sutin said. ""The heart kept falling into the aortal opening and had to be fished out with forceps."" Calvecchia is awake and alert, but he could not address the media, as doctors have cautioned him against movement of any kind for the rest of his life. ""His heart is already pounding like a jackhammer at a rate of approximately 1,100 beats per minute,"" Sutin said. ""His family has advised the nursing staff what TV shows he prefers, as changing the channels or requesting that it be done could induce a massive coronary."" Due to the rate of cardiac excitement that could result, Calvecchia is not permitted to watch news, sports or comedy shows of any kind. The only programming he is allowed to have on is cable-access city-council meetings and UPN's The Sentinel. The operation is being hailed as the biggest breakthrough in interspecies transplants since October 1995, when doctors at New York's Mt. Sinai Hospital implanted a Brooklyn man with a hamster liver. Though the procedure was initially successful, the liver developed terminal cirrhosis when the patient used an alcohol-based mouthwash."

""Must have coffee,"" said Cutler, pausing to scream between sips of the deadly 150-degree beverage. ""Must have coffee."""
Freak Accident Paralyzes Man From Waist Up,8/12/98,556,"MESA, AZ—A bizarre, unprecedented spinal injury sustained in a car accident Saturday has left local resident Roberto Montenegro paralyzed from the waist up. ""Roberto is back on his feet,"" said Mesa General Hospital head of surgery William Crist. ""Unfortunately, though, he has lost all feeling in his head, arms and torso. No longer able to move from the waist up, he cannot eat, speak, dial a telephone, type, open doors, or look sideways."" Doctors said Montenegro should be able to resume his career as a professional soccer player as early as next week."
Depression Sufferer Insufferable,7/29/98,4228,"DURHAM, NC—Despite an elaborate regimen of prescription medications and thrice-weekly therapy sessions, local depression sufferer Gary Blanke remains a horribly insufferable person, area sources reported Tuesday. Blanke, 28, an unemployed former gas-station attendant who has battled debilitating bouts of self-loathing and despair for most of his adult life, is reportedly so deeply immersed in his own selfish little world that relatives and acquaintances find it nearly impossible to be around him for more than a few minutes at a time. ""I have so many problems that nobody, least of all a person as weak and damaged as myself, could ever be expected to overcome them,"" Blanke told a steadily dwindling crowd of reporters. ""What am I going to do? I've got nowhere to turn. It's never going to get any better, I just know it. I might as well just give up."" Added Blanke, ""I'm so sorry you have to see me like this. You don't deserve to have to listen to me unloading all this on you."" He then broke down in uncontrollable, deeply annoying sobs. Though those who know Blanke do their best to offer at least a modicum of sympathy, he is so unrelentingly unhappy and emotionally needy that he depletes most people's reserves of patience and interest in no time, leaving sad, withered husks of aborted friendships in his wake. ""I know I'm a burden on everyone,"" Blanke said. ""I'm so pathetic, I know you must all hate me."" ""Man, do I hate that guy,"" said Kevin Deshaies, Blanke's former roommate, expressing the general consensus of everyone who has met the longtime depressive. ""You kind of feel sorry for him at first, but after the first 10 hours of listening to him whine, you find yourself wishing he was dead."" Though Deshaies has not spoken to Blanke voluntarily since 1993, he still runs into him occasionally at a neighborhood convenience store. Deshaies said he always takes pains to avoid being spotted by Blanke in the store, but, more often than not, he winds up getting sucked into tedious discussions with Blanke about the minutiae of his every neurotic dilemma. ""Nothing's worse than getting cornered by Gary and having to listen to him pour out his guts for hours on end,"" Deshaies said. ""The absolute worst is when he starts crying and you have to hug and comfort him or something, even though all you really want to do is push him down a flight of stairs."" Eternally on and off a variety of antidepressant medications and bouncing from one esoteric belief system to another on a near-weekly basis, Blanke's psyche is a veritable minefield of irritating catch-phrases and insufferable self-pity. ""I am so ashamed of how I always lean on other people instead of facing up to my problems, but I'm just too weak to face them alone,"" said Blanke, starting his sentence, as he does nearly all his sentences, with the word ""I."" ""I just wish all my pain and agony would end so I wouldn't be such a burden to everyone all the time."" Though Blanke has sought counseling many times over the past 15 years, his debilitating character flaws have precluded him from establishing a productive longterm relationship with any of his various therapists. ""I've seen Gary on-and-off for maybe 12 years, and it has pretty much all been a wasted effort,"" Dr. Joan Aldrete said. ""He's desperate for someone to listen to him, but, nine times out of ten, he won't even show up for his scheduled appointments because of some new crisis. He gets fired from work, or maybe some girl rejects him, and then he becomes so engulfed in self-loathing that I don't hear from him for months. He's so wrapped up in his depression and misery that he's incapable of working toward a true healing. In my professional opinion, in all my years of counseling, I don't believe I've ever met anyone I liked less."" Noted therapist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum agreed. ""The truly awful thing about severe depression,"" he said, ""is not the damage it does to the sufferer, but the damage done to those who have to spend time around irritating, melodramatic, selfish pricks like Gary Blanke."" Blanke remains in full agreement with his critics. ""I know. I'm sorry,"" he said, staring at the floor and whining pathetically. ""They're right. I am pathetic. I know. I'm sorry."""
New Smokable Nicotine Sticks: Can They Help Smokers Quit?,7/22/98,4078,"LOUISVILLE, KY—When Adrienne Lundy, 37, a pack-a-day smoker from Louisville, was diagnosed last November with a malignant tumor on her right arm, she knew she had to kick the habit. But like many longtime smokers, Lundy found quitting to be much harder than expected. ""Gums, patches, hypnosis—you name it, I tried it,"" said Lundy, a Marlboro smoker for 21 years. ""Nothing worked—until I my doctor told me about a new product called Nicarest."" Lundy is not alone. To date, more than two million American smokers have tried Nicarest, a specially treated nicotine stick which, when lit and inhaled, is said to completely curb a person's craving for cigarettes. Manufactured by QuitLabs, a Winston-Salem, NC, pharmaceutical company, Nicarest is made of processed tobacco by-products and medicated with carefully calculated doses of nicotine and antibiotic ""tar."" Nicarest has won the endorsement of the Surgeon General, American Cancer Society and American Medical Association, and has quickly become the most popular stop-smoking aid on the market. ""Whenever I get the urge for a cigarette, I just head for Nicarest Country instead,"" said Doug Luedtke, 44, a Wichita Falls, TX, forklift operator who said his smoking was ""completely out of control."" ""Unlike patches and gums, Nicarest duplicates the sensation of actually smoking a cigarette, filling my lungs with rich, satisfying smoke,"" he said. ""And at just $3.50 for a 20-stick pack, it's not much more expensive than cigarettes."" ""Nicarest may have saved my life,"" said Lundy, playing with her newborn daughter in the yard of her home, her cigarette cravings held firmly in check by the freshly lit nicotine cylinder wedged in the corner of her mouth. ""I haven't touched a Marlboro since discovering Nicarest. Not one."" QuitLabs CEO Charles Randle, the tobacco pharmacologist who developed the ""combustible medicated habit-cessation nicotine-delivery ampule,"" said he came up with the idea for the product while working for Philip Morris in the late '80s. ""From my work at Philip Morris, I was familiar with the process of transferring nicotine to the human lung via an oxidized vegetable-matter medium,"" Randle said. ""From there, it was a simple matter of applying that know-how, not to smokers, but to smokers who wanted to quit."" ""By doubling the nicotine dosage in Nicarest,"" Randle continued, ""we removed any biochemical reason for a smoker to fall back on cigarette dependency. But smokers aren't just accustomed to nicotine. They're also accustomed to the visual, tactile, oral, and even psychological sensations of having a small lit cylinder of tobacco in their mouths. That's what Nicarest gives them. That's our secret."" Apparently, the strategy has worked. Though it has been on the market for less than two months, Nicarest—available in Regular, Filters, Lights, Ultra Lights, Slims and Menthol—already outsells all other stop-smoking aids combined. And on June 25, RJR Nabisco purchased a controlling interest in Nicarest, Inc., making Randle a very rich man. Sales continue to skyrocket as increasing numbers of smokers abandon their cigarettes for Nicarest. The long-familiar ""smokers' corners"" outside schools and businesses are rapidly disappearing, as smokers calm their cravings with Nicarest wherever they may be, since Nicarests are permitted in areas off-limits to regular smokers. ""Whenever and wherever I get the urge—at the movies, at work, in a restaurant—I can inhale Nicarest's robust, satisfying medication and calm my body's urges,"" said Cynthia Mecklenburg of East Meadow, NY, a two-packs-a-day Nicarest user who learned of the product from a recent television advertisement. ""And it's the one stop-smoking aid that's alive with pleasure."" ""My baby's not going to grow up in a house filled with harmful cigarette smoke,"" said Lundy, who plans to start her daughter on Nicarests as a preventative measure as soon as she turns 16, the age at which Lundy started to smoke. ""Her mother is going to be a Nicarest user. When she's older, she'll realize just how important that difference really is."""
Report: Aspirin Taken Daily With Bottle Of Bourbon Reduces Awareness Of Heart Attacks,6/10/98,2025,"PHILADELPHIA—In a medical breakthrough that should come as welcome news for millions of at-risk Americans, University of Pennsylvania cardiologists announced Tuesday that taking one aspirin tablet and a fifth of bourbon daily can ""significantly reduce"" an individual's awareness of heart attacks. ""This study represents a major victory in the fight against heart disease, America's number-one killer,"" said Dr. Arthur Katzeff, head of the University of Pennsylvania team. ""Each year, more than two million Americans clutch their chests in terror and say, 'Jesus Christ! I'm having a fucking heart attack!' With this revolutionary new aspirin-bourbon treatment, however, such fully conscious incidents of cardiac arrest may soon be a thing of the past."" According to Katzeff, test subjects who were administered a single aspirin tablet in the morning, followed by a fifth of bonded Kentucky bourbon over the next several hours, were 85 percent less likely to realize they were having a heart attack than subjects who did not take aspirin with bourbon. Americans are excited about the findings. ""My four heart attacks have all been hellish,"" said Ronald Diering, an Evansville, IN, auto mechanic. ""I was aware of everything that was happening, and I was gripped by the fear that I was going to die. But with this new aspirin-bourbon treatment, future heart attacks should be much less traumatic."" ""Who wants to spend what could be their last moments on Earth in terror?"" said Alex Broadhurst of San Jose, CA. ""Better to enjoy another bourbon and lie on the floor waiting for the ambulance to show up."" University of Pennsylvania researchers said individuals who take aspirin and bourbon in the prevention of heart attacks may experience certain side effects, including slurred speech, impaired vision, and vomiting. Upon waking up from a heart attack, researchers said, there is also a chance of having ""a wicked hangover."" In such cases, individuals are strongly advised to avoid bright lights and not to move around too much."
Networks Urge Scientists To Release Latest Breast-Cancer Findings During Sweeps Week,4/29/98,950,"NEW YORK—A coalition of network-news executives made an appeal to breast-cancer researchers Monday, urging them to release any new findings about the disease in time for May sweeps. ""It is imperative that we have the latest information about the war against breast cancer,"" ABC News executive Andrew Diehl said. ""Without it, we will be unable to educate the American people, or show ratings-grabbing stock footage of women in backless hospital gowns getting mammograms."" Magazine editors are supporting the appeal, as well. ""Our recent breast-cancer cover story—which featured a picture of a woman's naked torso with a hand cupping the breast–was our biggest seller this year,"" Time managing editor Fred Case said. ""Time is fully committed to providing top-notch, full-color coverage of this dread disease."" The network executives also urged scientists to step up research on possible new forms of cancer, including inner-thigh cancer and ass cancer."
Hippocratic Oath 'Under Review' By HMO Board,4/08/98,4505,"INDIANAPOLIS—In a development bioethicists and health-care industry professionals are watching closely, the board of directors of Indiana HMO PhysCare-Plus, one of the largest and most powerful HMOs in the nation, announced Monday that the Hippocratic Oath is currently ""under review."" According to board members, the 2,400-year-old oath, attributed to the Greek physician Hippocrates and generally acknowledged as the cornerstone of medical ethics, is ""outmoded and no longer economically viable in today's complex, rapidly changing health-care environment."" ""Here at PhysCare-Plus, our goal has always been the same: to provide customers with dependable, first-rate health care. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so when we are hampered by an ancient moral code penned by a contemporary of the historian Herodotus somewhere between 470 and 360 B.C.,"" said Dr. Cedric Samms, head of the PhysCare-Plus board. ""While the oath is admirable for its idealism, it simply does not take into account the many complexities and economic realities of medicine in the modern age."" Added Samms: ""The personal touch…. That's the PhysCare-Plus difference."" According to Samms, the Hippocratic Oath is too narrow and inflexible, placing too many restraints on health-care professionals and requiring doctors to provide additional services which undercut their profits and hinder their ability to remain competitive. Because of the medical profession's strict adherence to antiquated moral principles and dogma, Samms argued, both doctors and HMOs are adversely affected. ""Take, for example, the portion of the oath which states, 'I will follow that system of regimen which, according to my judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients,' Samms said. ""For years, doctors have complained that the notion of practicing medicine with the patient's health as the number-one priority is not only outdated, but unfair. By putting the patient's welfare before cost considerations, doctors place themselves at risk of antagonizing HMOs, which pay for the bulk of medical bills under the current system. Every time a precautionary electrocardiogram is done on someone suffering from chest pain, it is the HMOs that truly suffer."" Also under intense scrutiny is the line, ""With purity and holiness I will practice my art."" ""Medicine has changed a great deal over the last 2,400 years, and 'purity' and 'holiness' are strong words that may no longer be viable given current cost outlays,"" PhysCare-Plus vice-president of operations Dr. Kyle Loveland said. ""And, as far as the use of the word 'art' goes, perhaps in ancient Greece physicians could consider themselves artists, but today's medical industry is a multibillion-dollar business."" PhysCare-Plus officials have proposed changing ""purity and holiness"" to ""acumen and savvy,"" and to change the term ""art"" to ""career."" Of all the disputed elements of the oath, however, the passage drawing the most fire is the one that reads: ""Whatever in connection with my professional service… I see or hear in the life of men… I will not divulge, reckoning that all should be kept secret."" ""There is no way an HMO can properly function bound by such a rule,"" said PhysCare-Plus member-accounts departmental supervisor Toby Francis. ""HMOs must be free to disclose patients' medical, personal, and financial information to insurers. How else can we determine what treatments a patient is or isn't eligible to receive? If someone needs a new lung and they don't have the necessary funds to pay for it, how are we supposed to know not to perform the surgery? I can't tell you how many cost overruns have been rung up as a result of doctors providing life-saving operations in accordance with the Hippocratic Oath, only to find out afterwards that the patients weren't covered. In a case like that, the surgery turns out to be for nothing. I get burned up just thinking about it."" If approved by the PhysCare-Plus board, the revised Hippocratic Oath is expected to have a major effect on the health-care industry, with other HMOs across the U.S. likely to follow suit. But regardless of whether or not the revised Hippocratic Oath—tentatively titled the ""PhysCare-Plus Family Econo-Plan Quality Pledge""—is passed by the board, one thing is certain: Health-care providers' attitudes are shifting. ""As the millennium approaches, the medical industry must look toward the future, not the past,"" Samms said. ""After all, as Hippocrates himself said, vita brevis. Life is short."""
New Children's Hospital Filled To Capacity,4/01/98,1582,"ATLANTA—When Andrew Nash decided to abandon a successful career in land development to pursue his lifelong dream of owning his own children's hospital, he hoped the venture would be successful. But he never dreamed it would be this successful. Open just two weeks, Nash Children's Hospital in downtown Atlanta is already proving to be a big hit, its 635 beds fully occupied and its emergency room boasting waits of up to seven hours. ""I was hoping this place would do well, but this is beyond what I could have possibly imagined,"" said Nash, surveying the bustle in the hospital's nephrology ward. ""Just look at this—rows upon rows of kids hooked up to my dialysis machines. It's absolutely phenomenal."" ""It's just so exciting,"" Nash said. ""Every day I come in here, and there's more and more kids. We've barely got enough IV drips for all of them."" Business only got better yesterday, when an 18-wheeler slammed into a school bus at a busy Atlanta intersection. In all, 31 children had to be hospitalized with injuries ranging from broken clavicles to massive brain contusions. ""As soon as I heard about that bus crash, I called up my wife, and we went out to dinner to celebrate,"" Nash said. ""It's still hard to believe how well things are going."" So popular is the new hospital, patients are flocking to it from all over the Southeast. Last Friday, an eight-year-old boy from Shreveport, LA, checked in for a bone-marrow transplant, a $153,000 procedure. ""That's a lot of money to spend,"" Nash said, ""but people really seem to love this place. I just hope they keep coming back."""
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Linked To Bad Parents Who Could Have Done Something,3/25/98,3794,"WASHINGTON, DC—According to a study released Monday by the National Pediatric Association, a link exists between Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the mysterious condition that results in the unexplained death of 1 in 500 U.S. infants each year, and bad parents who could have done something. After conducting interviews with some 1,500 parents of SIDS victims, researchers discovered a connection between the tragic death of a seemingly healthy baby and the terrible people who had completely failed in their role as parents and caregivers. ""For years, the medical community did not know what causes SIDS, as no single factor appeared to be common to all cases,"" National Pediatric Association director Dr. Lucille Reese said. ""But we have finally isolated a unique trait shared by all SIDS victims known as malis parentibus, or 'bad parents.' After all, these parents must have done something wrong. Why else would this have happened?"" The three-year study found that, not only could parents of SIDS victims have prevented the death of their children by not being such incompetent caregivers, they also failed to love their children enough in the weeks or months leading up to the infant's death. ""Three days before Derek left us I swore at him,"" said a tearful Helene Fordice of Butte, MT, who lost her son to SIDS Feb. 11. ""My horrible words, 'Sweetie, for God's sake, hold still a second so mommy can change you,' will haunt me for the rest of my life."" Fordice, one of the many parents who participated in the study, also reported that she had failed to let Derek know how important he was to her while she still had the chance. ""If I'd been a better mother, Derek would be alive today,"" Fordice said. According to the study, the bad parenting that causes SIDS can take on many forms, including breastfeeding incorrectly, leaving the child unsupervised for 35 seconds, holding the baby too often or not enough, and failing to have the child baptized. SIDS deaths have historically been difficult to accept by those in the medical profession due to the extremely young age of the victim and the many unanswered questions surrounding the syndrome. Despite the fact that SIDS is the single leading killer of infants, doctors have had little definite information to offer the public—until now. ""We've spent years searching for the cause of SIDS, examining such factors as maternal health and age, prenatal care, birth procedure and immunization history,"" said Dr. Ravi Harmuti, co-chair of the study. ""But we'd never been able to tie all SIDS cases together until we pinpointed the unbelievable incompetence of the parents involved."" ""Finally, we'll be able to give parents an explanation for the SIDS-related death of their child,"" said Dr. Milton Kessel, Director of Pediatric Medicine at Boston Lutheran Hospital. ""From now on, whenever a bewildered, hysterical parent asks what happened, we can end their confusion and let them know that they are entirely to blame."" The National Pediatric Association findings are the result of groundbreaking new interview-based research methods. Instead of examining tissue samples, autopsy results and specific environmental factors, the study focused on testimonials given by grief-stricken parents who were asked to honestly assess how much they really wanted a child, anyway. As a result of the study, the National Pediatric Association is embarking on a nationwide SIDS public-awareness program. It is hoped that the new ""SIDS: It's All Your Fault"" campaign will result in a sharp overall reduction in SIDS-related fatalities. ""Now that we know that bad parenting is the culprit, no infant need die of SIDS again,"" Reese said. ""Except, of course, in those instances in which the SIDS death is God's way of punishing a parent for some past sin."""
Smoking Now Permitted Only In Special Room In Iowa,3/17/98,4413,"WASHINGTON, DC—The nation's anti-tobacco lobby scored another major victory Monday, when Congress passed legislation restricting smoking in the U.S. to a specially designated ""smoking lounge"" in Oskaloosa, IA. The lounge, a storage closet located in the basement of Oskaloosa's American Legion Hall #3567, will protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of the second-hand smoke of the nation's approximately 65 million smokers. ""Smokers have infringed upon the rights of others for far too long,"" said U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), co-sponsor of the bill. ""Now that this issue is finally settled, we can all 'breathe a little easier.'"" ""I really need a smoke right now,"" said White Plains, NY, resident Peter MacAlester, 52, speeding westbound along Interstate 80 toward Oskaloosa. Biting his fingernails and wiping sweat from his forehead as he drove, he added, ""I figure if I drive straight through and manage to stay awake, I can probably get there within the next 16 hours."" The legislation's passage ranks among the most significant moments in the battle against smoking in the U.S. These include the 1989 Supreme Court decision to limit smoking to the Midwest; Congress' 1993 restriction of smoking to Iowa only; the Iowa Supreme Court's 1995 statewide ban on smoking except in Oskaloosa; and the Oskaloosa City Council's 1997 declaration that, with the exception of the American Legion Hall, Oskaloosa would be designated a smoke-free city. Smoking opponents throughout the Oskaloosa area are applauding the latest piece of legislation, which bans smoking in the American Legion Hall, except in the basement's storage closet. ""It's about time,"" Oskaloosa non-smoker Caryn Tapp said. ""That building's tolerant 'all-areas' open-smoking policy encouraged the filthy habit. Not only that, but the building's proximity to the local Arby's helped promote tobacco use among Oskaloosa's 65 teens."" ""My daughter lives in California, and she's refused to bring my newborn grandson to visit me because of that building's relaxed smoking code,"" said Harriet Mortimer, 63, who lives down the block from the American Legion Hall. ""But now that it's been restricted to the basement storage closet, she's considering coming here."" Added Mortimer: ""That closet doesn't have any windows, does it?"" As popular as the new legislation is among Oskaloosa-area non-smokers, it is every bit as unpopular among smokers across the U.S. ""Having to get to Iowa to grab a smoke on my lunch break every day was certainly inconvenient enough: Oskaloosa doesn't even have a 7-11, let alone an airport."" said Boston marketing executive Daniel Freeburn, 38. ""But now, on top of everything else, we have to deal with this? That lounge only has room for, at most, 40 or 50 people, and that's when they're packed in like sardines. With lines of up to 50 or 60 million people during noontime rush periods, I'm sometimes as much as six months late getting back to my desk."" Gnawing at the bruised, bloodied ball of his thumb, Freeburn added: ""Fucking shit-ass Christ piss!"" He then asked if anyone had any gum. Less than an hour later, he was reportedly arrested by Boston police for bashing his office supervisor's head against a desk. Across the U.S., smokers have resorted to desperate measures in order to sidestep the latest government restrictions. Some have been caught hiding cigarettes inside asthma inhalers. Tempe, AZ, smoker Abel Greene was recently caught attempting to dig a 700-foot-deep hole in the ground in the crawlspace beneath his home. According to police officials, Greene was planning to use the pit to secretly smoke in private, far beneath the Earth's surface. Despite the victory, anti-tobacco groups across the nation stress that the war against smoking is far from over. ""We still have a long way to go,"" said Francine Stotts, director of the Citizens Health Action Institute and a member of the board of directors of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? foundation. ""It is true that, by restricting all smoking in the entire country to a cramped closet in a barely accessible rural hamlet surrounded by nothing but miles of flat farmland in every direction, we have helped reduce the non-smoker's risk of exposure to secondhand smoke. But we cannot stop there. We must continue to lobby for greater restrictions until smoking is only allowed beyond the orbit of the outermost gas giant Neptune."""
"Channel 6's Suzy Pratt Has Today's Forecast, Debilitating Bouts Of Depression",3/04/98,3414,"NORFOLK, VA—While it's hard to know exactly what Mother Nature has in store for us most of the time, television viewers in the greater Norfolk area can count on one thing: The forecast will always be sunny coming from Channel 6 meteorologist Suzy Pratt. A fixture on the local CBS affiliate's 6 p.m. news for the past eight years, Pratt, 37, is mired in a years-long battle with depression, her crumbling dignity, extreme self-loathing and unfulfilling home life steadily eroding her will to live as she becomes increasingly addicted to painkillers. ""Keep it tuned to Channel 6 for the latest weather information,"" says Pratt, summoning all her strength to hold back the tears. ""Rain or shine, Channel 6 has got you covered."" Dinner time is always fun for Channel 6 viewers when Pratt is on the set, her cheery voice and snappy outfits sure to brighten things up when the weather forecast rolls around on weekdays at 6:18 p.m. Pratt, however, usually eats a Budget Gourmet dinner around 8 p.m., standing alone at her kitchen counter, her husband Bill too absorbed in his law practice to pay any attention to his home or spouse. Though unhappy in her loveless marriage, Pratt lacks the self-esteem to get out, blaming the marital woes on what she calls her ""fading looks."" During her years on the air in Norfolk, Pratt has developed into a genuine local celebrity, pleasing her many fans with her fun weather reports, engaging human-interest stories, and the occasional public appearance at a county fair or beauty pageant. ""El Niño's stirred up a whole mess of trouble throughout the Mid-Atlantic region, and Norfolk's certainly no exception. Look for lots more heavy rain tomorrow and through the weekend,"" says Pratt, choking back sobs she desperately hopes the home audience won't detect. Once an aspiring model/actress, Pratt learned the cold, cruel ropes of the business during a grueling year in Los Angeles, bouncing from one unsuccessful audition to another and, ultimately, into bed with a ""producer"" from whom she never heard again. Pratt now views life as something to be endured, consumed by what might have been, if only she had had just a little bit more foresight and wisdom. Norfolk residents might not always like the weather they get, but everyone loves the mile-wide smile and playful giggle they get from Pratt whenever news anchor Morton Caswell fires off another of his patented ""groaners."" Wearing a wig to hide the bald spots from the patches of hair she's pulled out, Pratt masks her pain on-camera with a big smile, each televised appearance a reinforcement of the perky, cheerful weathergirl archetype she has grown both to loathe and epitomize in her years at Channel 6. Whether it's ""stormy"" or ""warmy"" outside, the good folks of Norfolk know that with Pratt and the Channel 6 AccuTron WeatherAlert system on their side, they'll always be prepared for whatever Mother Nature sends their way. Pratt, meanwhile, grows increasingly delusional, convinced that a man in a maroon turtleneck is trying to kill her. Whether her crippling paranoia will result in an on-air breakdown, an unceremonious firing from Channel 6, or hospitalization is anyone's guess, but in the meantime, everybody is enjoying having Pratt as part of their day. As for her success as one of Norfolk's best-known faces, Pratt can only say, ""I value my job at Channel 6,"" before scurrying into her car and driving off."
Absent-Minded Professor Says Cure For Cancer 'Around Here Somewhere',1/21/98,4081,"BALTIMORE—After a lifetime dedicated to finding a cure for cancer, Johns Hopkins University absent-minded professor Humbert E. Huggins announced Monday that a 100 percent effective cure for cancer exists and is somewhere in his home, ""probably in that big pile of papers by the back door or in the one in the hall closet."" The cure, which involves ""smart enzymes"" that locate and surround cancerous and anaplastic cells, effectively ""suffocating"" them, was the result of 28 years of research by the comically forgetful Huggins and his cancer-research team at Johns Hopkins. Sorting through a three-foot-high stack of papers in his living room, Huggins said, ""I remember sticking something in here a couple of days ago. I think it might have been the cure."" Fellow researcher Patricia Graves explained how they arrived at the cure. ""Hundreds of thousands of experimental solutions over the last three decades were tested on laboratory mice that were infected with cancer,"" Graves said. ""When 15 batches of mice suddenly went into dramatic remission, we knew we had struck medical gold. Regrettably, the brilliant but addle-pated Professor Huggins was reviewing the records of the study in his home at the time."" As of press time, Huggins had yet to locate the three sheets of white notebook paper listing the precise formulations for test solutions BEC-32916 through 32930. He did stress, however, that he was ""retracing all my steps of the last few days."" The simplicity of the materials used ensured that when mass-produced in pill form, the cure would cost only four cents for a weekly dose. Huggins said he had intended to make the cure public domain to guarantee the global eradication of cancer within five years. He also said it is possible that the cure is in one of the blue binders that used to be on the shelf above his television and is now somewhere else. ""This is quite possibly the greatest breakthrough in medical history,"" Huggins said. ""And it is quite possibly in one of the boxes under the dining room table."" In a statement last week, the Nobel Foundation said that Huggins has been nominated for two Nobel Prizes in Medicine, one for finding the cancer cure and one if he finds it again. ""He lost the [cancer] cure?"" said team member Dr. Stephen Blake upon learning of the missing documents. ""How could he lose the [cancer] cure?"" Added Blake: ""What a [forgetful professor]."" The medical community is rejoicing over the discovery of the cure, wherever it may be. ""This discovery, as soon as it is discovered again, will surely usher in a new age for medicine,"" said Harvard University oncologist Dr. Henry Caldwell. ""Imagine a future in which those diagnosed with cancer will have only to go to the drugstore and pay a dollar for the cure. Has Professor Huggins looked in the back seat of his car? Because a lot of times I leave stuff there."" When informed of Caldwell's comments, Huggins responded that he does not own a car, because when he did own one, his absent-minded condition caused him to lose his keys ""constantly."" He said he has traveled to and from work by bus for the past 12 years. ""Jeez,"" Huggins said, ""I didn't leave it on the bus, did I?"" Millions of cancer patients around the world are excited by news of the breakthrough. ""Well, how hard is he looking?"" said 15-year-old Caryn Williams of Helena, MT, who was recently diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer. ""How big is that house of his?"" ""Actually, now that I think of it, it might be back at the office,"" Huggins said. ""I remember bringing one of my leather satchels there with a bunch of papers that were under my bed. But then where did I put it?"" Huggins has not ruled out the possibility that other, non-cancerous diseases can be cured with permutations of the cancer cure, or that the cure is in his basement, where many of his important papers are stored. Anyone with information regarding the location of the cure is asked to contact Professor Huggins at the university. He is not accepting calls asking where he last saw the cure. ""That's what I'm trying to remember,"" he said."
Doctors Closing In On 'Second Head-Bonk' Amnesia Cure,12/09/97,2809,"ROCHESTER, NY—Doctors at the prestigious Rochester Memorial Medical Institute announced Monday a major breakthrough in the battle to cure ""Head-Bonk Amnesia,"" a mysterious and debilitating form of memory loss caused by blows to the head. According to researcher Dr. Clayton Yates, Head-Bonk Amnesia, or HBA, affects an estimated 20 million Americans each year. The condition, he said, may be curable with an experimental ""Second Head-Bonk"" treatment, currently being tested at the New York facility. ""Head-bonk-induced amnesia—in which victims lose recollection of their identity after suffering sharp, zany blows to the cranial cavity with such household items as ladders, paint buckets, anvils and oversized novelty mallets—has long baffled science,"" Yates said. ""Our research now indicates that this condition, long considered incurable, may possibly be reversed with the application of a second head-bonk of equal or greater severity. It is our hope that millions of amnesiacs across the U.S. will one day have their memories of themselves and loved ones restored through such revolutionary, nutty treatment."" Despite their enthusiasm, Yates and the other members of the head-bonk research team stressed that a safe, cost-effective cure for HBA remains a long-term goal, and that further research is necessary before the second head-bonk procedure can become available to the public. ""The slightest miscalculation of strength and positioning of the second head-bonk could potentially result in a host of undesirable side effects, including but not limited to: honking, clanging and fire-engine sound effects; hallucinations of birds and stars flying in a circular pattern around the patient's skull; and, in the most severe cases, the flattening of the skull into the shape of the object with which the patient has been struck,"" said Dr. Thomas ""Tex"" Avery, head of the Rochester Institute research team. According to Avery, one of the greatest roadblocks to perfecting the second head-bonk cure has been ""the extreme difficulty of finding a head-bonking device that generates the precise amount of cranial bonk-pressure necessary to reverse the amnesia."" While such a device has still not been located, Avery noted that coconuts have shown promise in laboratory tests. ""The search for an HBA cure is one of the greatest, most important challenges facing modern medicine. Not only do its millions of victims suffer complete memory loss, but they also must endure on a daily basis the countless wacky mix-ups with loved ones, roommates, co-workers, and even pets that inevitably result from the condition,"" Avery said. ""Sadly, once these sorts of zany mistaken-identity capers begin,"" Avery said, ""it is usually just a matter of time before madcap shenanigans, many of them permanent and incurable, ensue."""
Scientists Isolate Pepsi-Resistant Gene,11/04/97,3552,"SOMERS, NY—At a press conference Tuesday, scientists working for the prestigious PepsiLab facility announced the historic, first-ever isolation of the long sought-after ""anti-Pepsi gene,"" the basic building block of DNA responsible for so-called ""Pepsi resistance"" in adult soda consumers. Visibly overcome with emotion, the team celebrated its discovery at the jubilant press conference, at which PepsiLab research head Jameson Hargrove opened a rare bottle of 1991 Crystal Pepsi and shared it with fellow scientists and reporters. According to Hargrove, those suffering from Pepsi resistance possess a rare strand of anti-nucleoPepside DNA absent in healthy, normal, ""Pepsi-positive"" people. By locating the mutant Pepsi-resistant gene, he said, his team has taken a major step toward finding a cure for hereditary Pepsidebility. ""For years, geneticists have searched for this gene in the hopes of making the great taste of Pepsi available to all people—even those stricken with Pepsidebility, such as Ed and Agnes Herlihy, of Augusta, ME, who have stated a lifelong preference to the other leading cola brand,"" Hargrove said. ""But now, with the isolation of this anti-Pepsi gene, we have taken the first step toward curing people like the Herlihys, who are outnumbered by Pepsi drinkers three-to-one. The long road to healing can now finally begin."" For the last several decades, it was thought that non-Pepsi-appreciative soda consumers could be cured only through massive bombardment of Pepsi-positive cathode radiation, administered through a television monitor. This risky, arduous form of treatment—which involved months of hours-long sessions of exposure to the celebrity-charged cathode rays—had serious side effects, including irritability and loss of sleep, and, in some cases, proved almost as debilitating as the condition it was intended to treat. Further, even when successful, the treatment typically had short-lived results. ""Even when $10 or 20 million was invested in obtaining a high-profile endorsement from, say, Michael J. Fox or the Jacksons, many of the patients tested resumed drinking the other leading cola brand immediately after the treatment stopped,"" said Hargrove. ""That's how insidious this condition is."" Hargrove said that in 1989, a team of Pepsi-funded scientists became convinced that if the genetic triggers for Pepsi-intolerance could be found, there might still be a way to help all people enjoy Pepsi permanently, painlessly, and without the expensive and often futile radiation-bombardment treatment. After nearly nine years of research, PepsiLab researchers are finally on their way to a cure. ""Isolating this gene was the major hurdle to curing Pepsi resistance,"" Hargrove said. ""Now, through the wonders of genetic surgery, the world's remaining non-Pepsi-drinkers will finally end their suffering and, for the first time in their lives, experience the refreshing taste of Pepsi—the choice of a new, next generation,"" Hargrove said. Pepsi corporate spokespersons stressed that, despite the breakthrough, genetic surgery is still an experimental science, and that the actual genetic reengineering of vast sectors of the populace into loyal Pepsi consumers may not proceed ""for some time now."" ""It is our duty to our fellow man to help Pepsi be enjoyed by all, and we'll do everything we can to make that day a reality,"" Pepsi director of corporate communications Janet Dorner said. ""As long as one person out there is still afflicted with the terrible disease of non-Pepsi-consumership, we will not rest."""
Drug Use Down Among Uncool Kids,10/21/97,3138,"WASHINGTON, DC—According to a study released Monday by the Department of Health and Human Services, drug use is on the decline among uncool kids in the U.S. While nearly 80 percent of cool kids—whose levels of substance abuse have risen steadily throughout the '90s—use drugs, the study found that just .007 percent of uncool kids between the ages of 12 and 19 use drugs, down from .012 percent in 1990. ""Really, this should surprise no one,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said. ""If you'd ever met any of these kids, you'd be amazed they ever left their own bedroom, let alone smoked a joint."" DEA guidelines established in 1989 define ""uncool"" kids as those who ""are introverted and passive; possess academic aptitude and physical ungainliness; and live in constant fear of things that really aren't that big a deal."" Among the uncool kids polled for the federal study were high-school yearbook editors, people unable to do chin-ups for the President's Council On Physical Fitness test, Forensics Club secretary-treasurers, and newspaper carriers saving their money to buy a Capsela set. Uncool youths participating in the study cited many factors in their reluctance to use drugs. Fifty-six percent said that their parents would kill them if they tried drugs, and 62 percent believed their brain cells would erode from drug use, leading to poor SAT scores. An overwhelming 94 percent feared allergic reaction. ""I'm allergic to milk, cats and pollen,"" said Ted Boyce, 16, of Petaluma, CA, ""and I am afraid that if I smoke marijuana, Dr. DeSmet will give me more shots, which I don't want because they hurt, and they cause small red welts on my skin. Also, smoke irritates my eyes really bad."" Health and Human Services researchers tested the limits of uncool kids' aversion to drugs by enlisting 15 popular kids to pressure a sample group of A.P. calculus students to smoke marijuana. Resistance was universal. ""I was trying to get this geek named Jonathan to smoke a joint, and he just started crying,"" Sandusky High School (OH) star quarterback Chris Mitchell said. ""What a girl."" Of the many subgroups of uncool kids, fantasy-game enthusiasts used drugs the most. But even among this group, only .018 percent reported trying them. ""At GenCon '96, there was a rumor that some marijuana was present,"" 19-year-old Ken Odom of Enid, OK, said. ""My older brother said he'd seen a marijuana smoking pipe under this one Car Wars table, but this I never witnessed."" Shalala said that, while the Department of Health and Human Services is dedicated to fighting teen substance abuse, many uncool kids could nevertheless benefit from the occasional use of recreational drugs. ""It wouldn't hurt these kids to loosen up a little,"" Shalala said. ""I mean, yes, stay away from cocaine, LSD and all the heavy stuff, the stuff that fries your mind. But come on, you can certainly get away with some pot every now and then. Beer can also be nice. Or ask your parents to serve a nice table wine, like Beaujolais, with dinner. It adds a tangy zest to chicken and fish, and it'll take you out of your shell a bit. I mean, live a little."""
DMV Reconsidering 'One For The Road' Driver Relaxation Campaign,9/30/97,3176,"SPRINGFIELD, IL—With the drunk-driving fatality rate nearly tripling in Illinois in the past year, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles announced Monday it will re-examine its controversial ""One For The Road"" driver-relaxation promotional campaign. ""Driving a car can be an incredibly stressful experience,"" DMV spokesperson Dale Penn said. ""That was the idea behind One For The Road—we felt it was important for motorists to loosen up a bit before getting behind the wheel."" ""It does seem, though,"" Penn added, ""that the program may have needed some fine-tuning."" According to Penn, the One For The Road program had its roots in a DMV study revealing a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and driver confidence. ""We found that people who had consumed at least four beers or two mixed drinks before getting behind the wheel were twice as likely to believe they were in no danger of getting hurt or killed,"" Penn said. ""When operating a serious piece of machinery like a car, that's just the kind of confidence you need."" Among the DMV study's other findings: A majority of elderly respondents and female college freshmen reported being ""more mellow"" and ""really tuned into the road"" after just a single drink. Launched last fall, the $3 million One For The Road campaign included talks by police officers at Illinois high schools encouraging kids to start ""thinking about drinking""; a statewide drunk-driving poster contest; and a series of print and television ads featuring the slogans, ""Before You Hit The Road, Hit The Sauce,"" and ""Unwind… To Survive!"" In the time since the September 1996 launch of One For The Road, some 2,300 DUI-related fatalities have occurred in Illinois, a 275 percent increase over the previous year. ""Perhaps we need to reconsider certain aspects of the program,"" said Bill Gerhardt, co-creator of the program. ""We need to ask ourselves, 'What parts of this program are not working, and how can we fix them?'"" Despite the widespread criticism of One For The Road, some safety experts have expressed concern over what might happen without the program. ""If this program is cut, there are going to be countless alcoholics driving around sober, their hands shaking so bad they can't even keep them on the wheel. It's just not safe,"" said Hal Knauer, a safety advisor for the Illinois Board of Transportation. ""A person like that relies on alcohol for steady nerves."" Added Glenn Sturbert, an Illinois-licensed driver-examination official: ""Some of these 16-year-olds come in here so nervous that I'm afraid to get in the car with them. Now, I myself can't give them something to take the edge off—the DMV only has a Class B liquor license—but what's going on at home that the parental concern isn't there?"" Penn noted that even with the program's suspension, many brochures are available from the DMV offering information on ""getting loose."" ""These materials are there so that no driver can ever claim ignorance as a reason for having driven in an unnecessarily tense state,"" he said. One For The Road is not the only DMV program currently under fire. Also being investigated are the campaigns ""Smoke Up For Safety"" and ""Pack First!"""
Doctors Say Reagan's Dementia Increasingly Hilarious,9/23/97,2810,"YORBA LINDA, CA—Doctors in charge of providing ongoing medical care for Ronald Reagan announced Monday that the former president—whose mental and physical health have deteriorated since he was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in April 1993—has entered a critical state of rapid decline, causing his condition to be ""even more hilarious"" than before. ""As Mr. Reagan's dementia has advanced over the last few months, and he has slipped further and further away from us, his status has been amusing, to say the least,"" said Dr. Gregory Wachter, head of the Reagan medical team. ""However, recent progression of the disease into its advanced stages has made his overall condition markedly more severe and, I dare say, hilarious."" His face betraying genuine emotion, Wachter then related several side-splitting episodes of recent Reagan senility, including the former president's scrubbing his face and hands with scrambled eggs, his insistence that his table lamp had become pregnant, and his increasingly vehement demands to play ""Mr. Horsey"" with medical attendants. ""The fact that this particular patient was once the leader of the free world,"" Wachter added, ""only reinforces the intense comedic impact of seeing him put both feet into the same leg of his trousers and then, attempting to stand up, pitch violently forward into the waiting arms of Secret Service personnel."" According to Wachter, physicians upgraded Reagan's condition from ""amusing"" to ""very funny"" last January, when he began referring to all friendly females as ""pill lady"" and threatening females as ""Nancy."" The move to ""hilarious"" was made late last week, Wachter said, when Reagan began brandishing his wrinkled, shrunken penis at visitors who attempted to smoke in his presence, shouting, ""Fire engine! Fire engine!"" and voiding a brief dribble of urine in their direction. ""Sadly,"" Wachter said, ""it appears to be only a matter of time before Mr. Reagan's condition reaches the ""uproarious"" stage. Dr. Emil Gwertzmann, chief neurologist at UCLA Medical Center and a longtime member of the Reagan medical team, said that difficulty breathing, inability to speak and convulsions are just some of the symptoms associated with watching Reagan attempt to hold arms-reduction talks with a bag of Fritos. ""A sharp, stabbing sensation in the ribs can also be a side-effect of watching one of the most dominant political figures of the 20th century address a folding chair as 'Edwin Meese,'"" Gwertzmann said. ""It can be quite painful."" Reagan, when asked about his condition, denied any knowledge of the funds' diversion to the Contras and called for his favorite blue pillow. ""If the nation's air-traffic controllers do not return to work within the next 24 hours, they will be fired,"" Reagan said. ""Hello, pretty little birds. Hello!"""
DEA Chief: Winners Occasionally Use Drugs,9/09/97,3799,"WASHINGTON, DC—In a surprise announcement with wide-ranging implications for U.S. narcotics policy, Drug Enforcement Administration director Thomas Constantine acknowledged Monday that some winners ""may occasionally"" use drugs. ""Apparently,"" said Constantine, addressing reporters at Justice Department headquarters, ""contrary to the DEA's long-standing conviction, drug use may not be limited solely to the domain of losers. It appears that some successful Americans have experimented with illegal narcotics, as well."" The announcement was the result of a comprehensive three-year DEA study of more than 40,000 U.S. winners, including thousands of successful business executives, doctors, lawyers, scientists and civic leaders. The study, originally designed by the DEA to help shed light on the qualities shared by winners that make them resistant to drugs, instead revealed that over 71 percent of winners had at one time or another experimented with controlled substances. Constantine said that it remains unclear why winners, who enjoy successful, productive careers and feelings of love and acceptance from their families, would choose to engage in drug use. ""Time and time again, DEA tests have shown that no feeling you could get from drugs could be better than the great feeling you get from being a winner,"" Constantine said. ""Why a heart surgeon, an architect or a straight-A student would use drugs when his senses are already enormously heightened by the 'high' that comes from being a winner is beyond me."" Making drug use by winners all the more puzzling, Constantine said, is the fact that winners are more than strong enough to resist the peer pressure associated with drug use, do not need to get high to escape from a terrible life, and do not associate with the sort of people most likely to use drugs—namely, losers. DEA scientists said it also remains unclear how drug-using winners have managed to avoid addiction and the many well-known destructive side-effects of controlled substances. ""Winners seem to have an unknown quality that enables them to use drugs and keep on winning,"" DEA head researcher and narcotics expert Howard Tobin said. ""It goes against everything we know about drugs, but many of the drug-taking winners we studied did not, in fact, become losers. They did not lose control of their lives, nor did they lose their loved ones, their jobs, their homes, or their physical or mental well-being. There is clearly something at work here that we still do not understand."" Tobin cited the five-time Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys as a good example of winners who achieved greatness while engaging in frequent recreational drug use. ""In 1993 and 1994, the Cowboys clearly were winners, trouncing the Buffalo Bills—a team with no drug-users on its roster, mind you—in two straight Super Bowls by a combined score of 82 to 30,"" Tobin said. ""It's puzzling, to say the least."" One winner, Cupertino, CA, neurosurgeon Richard Frankel, a devoted family man and casual marijuana smoker, said that the DEA should not necessarily be surprised. ""I find that a little pot every now and then really helps me relax,"" he said. ""When you consider that marijuana is less addictive and less harmful than both nicotine and alcohol, it shouldn't be all that surprising that I, like so many of my esteemed and accomplished colleagues, choose to smoke up occasionally."" As a result of the study, the DEA has been forced to change many of its anti-drug awareness campaigns. On Tuesday, the agency ordered the recall of more than 150,000 U.S. video arcade games displaying anti-drug messages, including 27,000 Mortal Kombat II and N.A.R.C. units, which will be reprogrammed with an altered on-screen message from former FBI director William Sessions, ""Very Few Winners Use Drugs."""
"Lack Of Pre-Teen Cosmetic Surgery May Pose 'Serious Self-Esteem Risk,' Say Beverly Hills Doctors",8/26/97,3627,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA—Children who do not receive corrective cosmetic surgery before puberty run a serious self-esteem risk ""from which they may never recover,"" claims a study released Monday by a team of leading Beverly Hills plastic surgeons. According to the report, pre-teens forced to grow up without plastic surgery are 10 times more likely than their surgery-enhanced peers to feel hideously ugly during life's most crucial period of social and sexual development, causing them to go without dates, become sullen and withdrawn, and be incapable of giving or receiving love. ""Without appearance-enhancing surgery during the formative 5- to 12-year-old stage, children grow up feeling unloved and worthless,"" said Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon Dr. Stan Gaines, co-author of the report. ""Their enormous, misshapen noses and flat, lifeless, collagen-deprived lips make them virtual pariahs at school. It's sad to say, but for most of these children, the chances of growing up to marry a doctor or lawyer are virtually nil."" The report, compiled by seven Beverly Hills doctors over a five-year period, was the result of extensive research and hundreds of interviews with children, both with cosmetic surgery and without. ""In all cases, the children whose parents refused to provide them with cosmetic surgery expressed feelings of disappointment, rejection and a profound lack of parental love,"" the report stated, ""not unlike children who are deprived of birthday ponies."" Dr. Fima Abalhu, Beverly Hills liposculpturist and report co-author, said: ""My heart goes out to these children. They will grow up knowing that their uncaring families did not make any effort to ensure their well-being. Many will never have the self-confidence necessary to wear a string bikini or embark on a modeling career."" Among the serious long-term psychological damage outlined in the report: an unwillingness to go in or near the pool; lack of confidence in tanning, in some cases leading to pale, lackluster skin tone; lack of interest in spending money on clothes; and unenthusiastic participation in gala award-show celebrity photo-ops. ""I have seen these children stand unsmiling and dejected in full view of the paparazzi,"" Gaines said. ""No doctor—and no parent—should ever have to see such a thing."" The report also found that a whopping 96 percent of non-cosmetically-altered children interviewed had frequent thoughts like, ""I hate Mommy,"" and, ""Daddy never buys me anything I want."" Even more serious, such children were found to run a 200 percent greater risk of associating with the help. While cosmetic surgery is important for all children, it is especially critical for girls, the study said: Over 85 percent of participating 10-year-old girls who did not receive breast enhancements felt dissatisfied with their breasts. ""Without surgery, these girls have no chance of developing breasts before their bodies mature sexually, which often can be as much as four or five years later,"" Gaines said. ""We're talking about girls who are 8, 9, even 10 years old, who have absolutely no breasts whatsoever."" ""The conclusions of this study are clear,"" Beverly Hills eyelid specialist Dr. David Willoughby said. ""Millions of children are going without surgery vitally necessary for them to feel attractive and desirable amongst their peers. If you or someone you know has children who still haven't received any rhinoplasty, liposuction, prominent-ears correction or any other cosmetic surgery, for God's sake, talk to them right away. And get them to one of our seven convenient area locations for a free consultation before it's too late."""
Incorrect Pain-Reliever Brand Choice Results In Missed Job Promotion,8/12/97,3424,"SAN FRANCISCO—In a tragic case of pain-reliever brand choice gone wrong, Gus Farber, an assistant sales-team project coordinator with the marketing firm of Integrated Management Solutions, missed a rare opportunity for job advancement Monday due to an error in headache-relief medication selection. The pain reliever chosen by Farber, Mifrin(TM)-brand Extra-Strength Analgesic Gel Caplets, upset his stomach, depriving him of vital, stress-relieving sleep the night before a major presentation to his supervisor, one with significant job-promotion implications. Because of his Mifrin-induced stomach discomfort and subsequent inability to obtain a good night's sleep, Farber arrived at work the following morning in a state of dishevelment, disarray and general unpreparedness for his presentation. As a result, a co-worker received the promotion Farber described as ""meant for"" him. ""I went with the leading brand instead of the one that works,"" the unattractive, pot-bellied Farber told reporters. ""And now I'm paying for it."" The co-worker, strikingly handsome executive Chuck Shane, also had a headache the previous evening. Unlike Farber, however, he opted to take Anadol(TM)-brand Maximum Strength Gelcaps, Mifrin's chief rival in the highly competitive over-the-counter headache-remedy market, allowing him to sleep peacefully throughout the night. ""Anadol helped me get the rest I needed,"" said a smiling Shane, sporting a brand-new key to the executive washroom. ""It's the one that's gentler on your stomach."" Farber, who would have received a new company car and a 20 percent increase in salary as part of the promotion, is taking legal action against Mifrin. ""My client was placed at a considerable competitive disadvantage as a result of his use of Mifrin,"" Farber's lawyer, Alexander J. Willmer, said. ""He is being made to suffer merely because of a lack of good judgment in painkiller-brand decision-making, a matter entirely unrelated to his ability to do the job. My client and I believe it is the responsibility of Mifrin and its parent corporation, Global Tetrahedron Pharmaceuticals, to offer appropriate compensatory reparations."" Upon learning of the pending lawsuit against Mifrin, spokespersons at Tri-Omni Medicorp Consolidated, the Englewood, NJ-based manufacturer of Anadol, expressed sympathy and support for Farber. ""Mr. Farber's case is tragic, yet, sadly, quite common,"" said Tri-Omni Medicorp assistant director of corporate communications Rupert Sheen. ""There's no telling how many others just like him stand the risk of losing crucial sleep before major, potentially career-advancing business presentations, all because they unknowingly opt for the leading brand instead of Anadol, The Medicine That Helps You Get The Rest You Need(TM)."" Though Mifrin has yet to respond to the Farber lawsuit, company spokespersons dismissed Anadol's claims of offering superior headache relief during a press conference Tuesday. ""Mifrin Cures Headache Pain Fast,"" said Douglas Sheppard, creative director of Hamburg & Blaine, Mifrin's advertising agency. ""No other leading brand fights headaches as quickly and effectively as Mifrin."" ""Clinical studies show this, I might add,"" Sheppard said. ""Allow me to demonstrate with this luminous, computerized bar graph."" Reporters who examined the bar graph confirmed that the bar representing Mifrin was indeed the highest of the three bars depicted on the chart."
"AIDS Awareness Campaign Spreads Awareness, AIDS",7/23/97,3648,"BOSTON—With new AIDS cases on the decline for the fourth straight year and the disease in danger of losing millions of dollars in federal research funds, a group of concerned activists took to the streets of Boston Sunday to stress the importance of contracting AIDS. ""We've worked tirelessly for over 15 years to convince the government that AIDS research funding is vital,"" said Steve Hobart, an AIDS Now! spokesperson. ""But now, with AIDS on the decline, that's all in jeopardy. The only way to raise awareness of this deadly disease is to have more people die of it."" For the past six months, the New York-based activists have been traveling across the country, visiting college campuses and youth groups, spreading information about unsafe sex, and encouraging people to infect others with the virus. They have also passed out pamphlets sporting such slogans as, ""AIDS Is Cool,"" ""HIV Me!"" and ""Catch It!"" to more than 500,000 young people nationwide. Attractive, racially diverse models in sexy poses adorn the pamphlets. According to Hobart, if AIDS cases continue to decline at the current rate, America's once-booming $9 billion AIDS industry could suffer a total collapse by 1999. ""The AIDS industry employs hundreds of thousands of people, from benefit organizers to celebrity spokespersons to administrative staffers,"" Hobart said. ""Many of these people have families to feed. If AIDS is stamped out, what will these people do?"" ""The key,"" Hobart said, ""is to have lots of unprotected sex."" According to AIDS Now! co-founder Diane Forsberg, if federal AIDS monies dry up, hundreds of top graphic designers who create fashionable AIDS awareness buttons, posters and pamphlets would also be out of work. ""Who else will hire them? The breast-cancer people? The breast-cancer industry is strapped for funding as it is,"" Forsberg said. ""And what about Bette Midler?"" Forsberg said. ""Where will she go when there are no more celebrity AIDS Walks?"" Forsberg said that her group needs to raise $50,000 every year just for the manufacture and distribution of red ribbons. ""The only way we can pay for those is if more people start dying of AIDS in large numbers,"" she said. Though hardest-hit by the decline of AIDS has been the AIDS industry itself, others have been affected as well. Profits at Petersen Pharmaceuticals, an Englewood, NJ-based manufacturer of AZT, were down 44 percent last year, a figure company officials blame on the decline in new AIDS cases. The entertainment industry has not escaped unharmed, either. ABC reported record-low ratings for A Mother's Wish, a May '97 made-for-TV drama starring Judith Light about a boy who contracts the disease. ""Had we put out that movie five years ago,"" ABC vice-president of programming Bob Iyer said, ""it would have done huge numbers."" In the wake of last week's Center For Disease Control announcement that AIDS cases dropped 21 percent in 1996, Paramount Pictures announced it was shelving Lifeline, a $25 million AIDS drama starring Diane Keaton already in pre-production. But for all the negative economic impact the decline of AIDS has had, ultimately it is the members of the AIDS community themselves who are hurt the most. ""You have to understand,"" Hobart said, ""for years, this disease has brought people together, and given them a place to go. For many of these people, AIDS campaigning has been a vital self-esteem-building tool. And now they're in danger of having all of that taken away."" ""Just a few years ago, there were AIDS benefits every weekend,"" said Forsberg, recalling the disease's golden age. ""Now, you're lucky if there's a 5K run once a month. It's very sad."""
'Vehicular Manslaughter Doctor' Assists In 23rd Doctor-Assisted Vehicular Manslaughter,7/09/97,3534,"GRAND RAPIDS, MI—Dr. James Munson, known to millions as the infamous ""vehicular manslaughter doctor,"" participated in his 23rd doctor-assisted vehicular manslaughter Monday, running over an 81-year-old Michigan woman. Munson, who was arrested and charged with first-degree vehicular manslaughter in the incident, hit Mildred Peters of Portage, MI, with his 1994 Ford Escort in a supermarket parking lot, killing her instantly. ""She was clearly in terrible pain,"" said Munson, who did not know the woman. ""She was moving very slowly, and it was a struggle for her just to push the shopping cart to her car. I don't even think she would have been able to lift her groceries into the trunk without help. All this woman wanted was to die in a dignified, painless manner. Thank God I was able to give her that chance."" According to witnesses, after saying a prayer and lighting a candle, Munson got in his car and accelerated to an estimated 80 mph, hitting Peters head-on with the controversial four-wheeled euthanizing device. Munson's lawyer, Donald Ranieri, defended his client in a statement Tuesday. ""Dr. Munson's only interest is in easing the terrible pain of the nation's elderly,"" Ranieri said. ""It is his deep conviction that no one should have to suffer through life with Multiple Sclerosis, arthritis, or high blood pressure."" When informed of the incident, Peters' daughter expressed relief that the woman's suffering had finally ended. ""It had been years since my mother was able to live a normal life,"" said Jayne Peters-Williams, 48. ""She was so weak, she couldn't climb long flights of stairs. She needed help getting in the tub. And if she just wanted to read, she had to put on a special pair of glasses. What kind of a life is that?"" ""My mother's suffering is over at last,"" Peters-Williams said. ""As her crumbling, withered body soared through the air after being hit by Munson, for one shining moment she was finally free."" Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a federal ban on physician-assisted vehicular manslaughter without patient consent. Michigan is one of just five states that permit assisted vehicular manslaughter with consent of a family member. The nation's leading ethicists are divided on the issue of automotive euthanasia. While some, such as Hemlock Society president Milton Habisch, call it a ""clean, effective"" way to end the agony of chronic pain sufferers; others assert it creates more problems than it solves. ""The procedure is far from perfect,"" said Elaine Curtis, co-director of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? foundation. ""In 1991, his car ran out of gas just before he was about to hit a Goshen, IN, woman suffering from back pain, and he was forced to borrow the bicycle of a nearby child, riding over his victim an agonizing 175 times until she finally died of internal bruising."" Dr. Munson's controversial suicide device is controlled by two foot-activated levers, one for acceleration and one for braking. By pressing down hard on the acceleration lever, the machine increases in velocity to the point where anyone it is aimed at can be killed quickly and painlessly. As an added precaution, Munson anaesthetizes himself with a fifth of gin before each procedure. Munson has used the machine in the doctor-assisted vehicular manslaughter of 17 elderly people since 1994. Prior to that, he used a similar device, known as a ""1985 Dodge Omni,"" in the deaths of six others. The Omni device was scrapped after repeated technical problems, including a blown clutch."
Tobacco Companies Ordered To Pay Reparations Of $800 Billion In Camel Cash,7/09/97,2903,"WINSTON-SALEM, NC—As part of the most severe federal restrictions ever placed on the tobacco industry, Congress on Monday ordered cigarette manufacturers to pay restitution to thousands of smoking victims in the amount of $800 billion in Camel Cash. ""This is no mere slap on the wrist,"" Dan Stone, Mississippi attorney general and chief prosecutor against the Big Three, said.""These companies will have to hand out literally billions of dollars in Camel Cash, redeemable for attractive, exciting promotional gear, all at the tobacco industry's expense."" The cost of the reparations will be split evenly among all the companies named in the suit. Philip Morris will reimburse RJR by paying an equivalent value in Marlboro Miles, which the RJR board of directors may either convert to Camel Cash or exchange for its equivalent value in Benson & Hedges Bucks, tobacco manufacturer Brown & Williamson's standard unit of currency. Anti-tobacco lobbyists are elated by the judgment. ""At last the makers of deadly tobacco products are being held accountable for their actions,"" said Ed Young of the American Public Health Institute. ""In the future, these companies will think twice before deceiving and poisoning the public. And if they do, they'd better stock up on beach towels and compasses."" Sherilyn Thomas, 20, of Hialeah, FL, whose father died of lung cancer at 47, will be paid over 40,000 Camel bucks for her family's loss. ""I may have lost my father at an early age,"" Thomas said, ""but at least I will forever know that justice was served in the form of this stylish five-pocket canvas duffel bag."" As part of a special goodwill clause in the settlement, tobacco companies will also donate over $400 million in colorful cigarette ads to Third World magazines and newspapers. The companies will also donate more than $250 million in cigarette billboards to struggling, billboard-impoverished Asian and Eastern European nations. Smoker Randall Marsh, 44, diagnosed in May with throat cancer, is pleased that a strong message is finally being sent to the tobacco industry. ""Like most smokers, I enjoy rugged, hardy outdoor activity,"" Marsh said. ""And with my new Adventure Team tent, I can rest assured knowing I'll have camping-trip getaways to look forward to in between chemotherapy treatments."" If at any time during Marsh's cancer treatment his condition is declared incurable, he will instantly become eligible for an exclusive week's vacation at the ""Club Camel"" luxury resort in Phoenix. Also available to terminally ill smokers: an unprecedented 35 percent lifetime discount on cigarettes. ""We are complying fully with the government's decision in this matter,"" said Philip Morris CEO Ron Burks, whose company has voluntarily agreed to give the government a $75 million rebate on its controversial Newport Lights urban assault vehicle, currently being developed under contract for the military."

""Inner-city Americans now have four exciting new ways to narcotize themselves, with the quality of product and wide distribution they've come to expect from the CIA."" Reaction to the new drugs (see sidebar) was overwhelmingly positive. ""They had a tough act to follow after crack,"" said New York-area Mafia boss Alfonse DiBiasi, Deutch's close friend and former college roommate. ""But this new stuff is just as cheap and every bit as addictive. We're all very excited."" President Clinton praised the CIA as well. ""This is a win-win situation for all Americans,"" he said. ""Inner-city Americans will receive the powerful drugs they love, and the CIA will raise the funds they can't get from Congress to get their Jonestown mind-control experiment up and running again."" The new drugs are supported by months of CIA testing to ensure maximum potency and addictiveness. Focus groups, consisting primarily of homeless men and street orphans culled from ghettos around the country, were housed in an underground research facility beneath CIA headquarters in Langley, VA. Only after six months of exhaustive experimentation on members of this target demograph, who sampled hundreds of drugs, were the final decisions made. ""Everybody loves me because I am so beautiful. Anything is possible. I am going to live a very long and happy life,"" said Oakland, CA, native Charles Simmons, who spent 10 weeks testing Blue Glass, the CIA's new smokable euphoric drug. Simmons then leapt out a window to his death. ""I they I drugs these are very feel good right,"" said Dwayne Woodson of Bronx, NY, another CIA test participant. ""Pork chops three for $2.99."" CIA officials said that testing is necessary in order to avoid releasing potentially dangerous substances into the ghettos. ""One initially promising drug was later discontinued due to undesirable side effects, such as increased intelligence and feelings of love for others,"" said Dr. Harold Vandermeer, head of the CIA's narcotics development team. Initial product rollout began this week in the ghetto neighborhoods of Los Angeles, Detroit and New Orleans, with all residents receiving a special drug-sampler pack in the mail, including a full-color, English-Spanish promotional pamphlet and instructional videotape. If the market response is as favorable as the CIA expects, the drugs should be available in every ghetto in the nation as soon as August 1. ""I thought I'd never say this,"" Deutch said, ""but put down that crack pipe, ghetto-dwellers: You're going to love these new drugs."" Deutch went on to state that none of the above events ""ever happened"" and categorically denied any CIA connection with the new drugs."
Alzheimer's Sufferers Demand Cure For Pancakes,6/18/97,3491,"WASHINGTON, DC—Alzheimer's sufferers from across the nation marched on random buildings throughout Washington, D.C., Washington State, and Iowa City, IA, Monday, demanding that Congress prioritize finding a cure for pancakes, the nation's third-leading breakfast food. ""Until Budenheimer's is cured, there will never be enough bread in the laundry,"" said a spokesperson for the group, who identified himself variously as Dr. James Lustig, Brian Boitano, Mr. Jet Captain and Socko the Happy-Turtle. ""Until we are all properly rotated and serviced, none of us can ever truly be plaid."" Lustig's comments were echoed by fellow marchers, who warned that unless a cure for pancakes is found by 2000, they will continue to protest until led gently back to their homes by loved ones or trained health-care providers. Urinating in vending machines and occasionally emitting bird-like squawks, a group of protesters in downtown D.C. resisted police crowd-dispersal efforts for six hours, linking arms and joining in a chant of ""I like Ike!"" ""Pancakes are delicious, but their wily ways are not to be trusted,"" said Alzheimer's sufferer Marie Klapisch, speaking to a group of ducks gathered in front of the U.S. Treasury Building. ""Get those underpants away from my grandchildren's foot medicine, you filthy, dirty-minded bastards!"" She then burst into tears and ran off, scattering the assembled waterfowl. Pancakes, according to officials at the International House Of Pancakes' headquarters in Geneva, are consumed by approximately 40 million Americans each morning. They are, IHOP spokespeople said, extremely delicious whether served with syrup or a variety of fruity toppings, and are available 24 hours a day. Yet they admit that, as of now, there is no cure in sight. According to the General Accounting Office, current annual funding for pancake-related Alzheimer's research is approximately zero dollars. That amount, GAO officials said, has remained the same since the current record-keeping system for federal budget expenditures was established in 1809. With no cure for pancakes on the horizon and no federal research funds, the AD-afflicted activists have a long road ahead. Nevertheless, the group has continued to fight for its cause, leaving faucets running unattended for days at a time, placing tray after tray of ice cubes in mailboxes, and even, in some cases, throwing dogs at parked cars in what are presumed to be acts of solidarity with the pancake-cure movement. ""That battleship silverware of yours is no damn sofa sink hobo,"" Lakeland, FL, senior Elmer Bass said. ""Until a cure is found, there will be no more change given for anything less than a 40-dollar bill."" The feelings of the Alzheimer's community were best summed up by retired lawn-care professional Max Gherkin of Flagstaff, AZ, who marched all the way to Washington clad only in a frilly, 1940s-era ladies' support hose that once belonged to his deceased wife. ""Fellow Shriners,"" Gherkin said, ""Alzheimer's is a crippling disease that can cause dear family members to lose not only their fruit flies, but their self-esteem, fertilizer invoices, Pastor Bob, and personal dignity, as well. I beg you all, from deep in my rototill: Frog battleship now, and please put an end to pancakes, pans, cakes, cake pans, pants, snakes, and all they represent. Firemen! Can't you see the bicycle release valve is already undersea?"" He then burst into a string of expletives, as his bathrobe had become entangled in a bush."
Chrysler Halts Production Of Neckbelts,4/30/97,4242,"DETROIT—Violent decapitations and permanent paralysis due to severing of the spinal cord are among the reasons cited by the Chrysler Corporation for its decision to recall all '97 automobiles containing the ""neckbelts"" safety feature. ""In the case of collision, it would appear that the neckbelts have a detrimental effect on overall passenger safety,"" read a statement released by the company Monday. The recall, the most expensive in Chrysler's history, goes into effect early next week. In the meantime, the company is advising all motorists who use the neck belts to maintain a defensive driving stance at all times, as accidents may result in ""crushed trachea, severe spinal and/or brain damage, and, in the most severe cases, sudden defenestration of the head area, as the entire region above the neck separates from the upper body, flying at tremendous speed through the breakaway glass of the windshield, rolling several yards into the street directly in front of the car,"" the Chrysler press release stated. The neckbelts were developed with passenger safety in mind, say Chrysler spokespersons. ""Our research showed that one of the biggest risks to motorists is the danger of passengers sustaining head injuries by striking the dashboard or the seat in front of them as their bodies are flung forward during a crash,"" Chrysler safety designer Robert McArdle said. ""Our thinking was that by immobilizing the head and neck, this type of injury would decrease significantly."" The belts, McArdle said, were also intended to reduce the neck stress associated with whiplash. ""Unfortunately, it appears that we were erroneous in this analysis as well,"" he added. ""Even minor fender-benders seem to cause motorists wearing neckbelts to have their entire heads forcibly ripped from their torsos, landing in the front seat to the shocked screams of terrified onlookers."" Another negative side effect of the neckbelts is the psychological damage that may be suffered by eyewitnesses upon observing a convulsing, headless human body spontaneously jettison fountains of blood as the adrenaline-maximized heart furiously pumps quart after quart from the neck wound, coating the car interior, the Chrysler statement continued. Neckbelt wearers are warned that a severed human head may remain alive for up to two minutes before blood loss, oxygen starvation and shock trauma cause it to lose consciousness. ""Brain death is something science still knows very little about,"" said Chrysler safety engineer Tom Savini, ""but drivers should take note that law enforcement personnel have reported observing bouncing, rolling severed heads blinking their eyes and gasping for air as if attempting to speak minutes after separation from the torso on more than one occasion."" Savini said that such still-alive severed human heads ""probably live out their last moments in a state of unimaginable agony,"" and urged caution on the part of drivers who wear the neckbelt device. In addition to decapitation and paralysis, some consumer advocates have complained that the neckbelt safety devices inhibit side-to-side motion of the head, causing drivers to swerve wildly back and forth in order to maintain a clear view of the street. Other negative side effects cited include difficulty in breathing, eating and talking. In the wake of industry-wide concern about the safety of the neckbelts, Chrysler is also reexamining the so-called ""shrapnelizing"" explosive dashboard which became a standard safety option on all new models in 1995. ""By splintering into literally thousands of rapidly spinning jagged fragments, which ricochet around the car's interior at tremendous speeds, tearing any living tissue inside to shreds in seconds, these dashboards may represent a significant safety risk to motorists,"" read a report submitted to CEO Robert Eaton by a Chrysler safety engineering team. Many observers are comparing the Chrysler recall to the controversy surrounding the 1976 Ford Pinto, the economy-model compact which, when rear-ended, ignited its fuel tanks and became doused in flaming gasoline, causing passengers to ineffectually pound on the windows and scream as they were burned alive at superheated temperatures within, before exploding as a bomb does."
Pharmaceutical Company Says Its New Anti-Depressant Is 'Worthless And Dumb',4/09/97,3722,"EAST BRUNSWICK, NJ—At a press conference Monday, Peter Cafazzo, CEO of Brunley-Hunt Pharmaceuticals (BHP), introduced his company's latest anti-depressant, Cyntrex, a product he described as ""a totally stupid waste of time that probably nobody will ever want ever."" Though from the outset, BHP had hoped the new medication would revolutionize the treatment of depression, Cafazzo is less than enthusiastic about its chances against such industry leaders as Prozac and Zoloft. ""Cyntrex? Yeah, right. More like, Stupidtrex,"" a visibly downcast Cafazzo told reporters. ""More like, Another-Awful-Product-That-Will-Probably-Make-Us-All-Bankruptrex. More like, I suck."" The new drug, which stimulates the production of neurotransmitters in sync with the body's natural diurnal catecholamine rhythms—causing a more even mood level than the frequent ""crest and trough"" patterns associated with traditional psychoactive medicinal treatments—is something that ""everybody will laugh at,"" Cafazzo said. Among the reasons Cafazzo cited for Cyntrex's ""totally doomed future"" is BHP's inability to do anything half as well as its chief competitors. ""Prozac is so great,"" Cafazzo said. ""We'll never make anybody as happy as Prozac does. I just know it."" Added Cafazzo: ""My life is shit."" The release of Cyntrex is the latest bold move by BHP, which has increased its share of the mental-health drug market from 7 to 11 percent during the five years Cafazzo has been the company's CEO, causing many to view BHP as the rising giant in $150 billion pharmaceutical industry. Cafazzo, however, questions the validity of such an appraisal. ""Eleven percent? Oh, I'm sure. Like a company's really going to do that well with such a total fucking loser asshole for a boss."" ""Maybe I'll get a raise,"" he said. ""Then I can use the money to buy a gun to blow my head off."" According to reports, top BHP researchers began having doubts about the drug during the early development stages, when they realized they couldn't do anything right ever ever ever, and that none of the pharmaceutical-industry leaders cared whether they lived or died. But work on the project continued, despite BHP's growing conviction that Cyntrex would be the worst product in pharmaceutical history. ""We should have just stopped trying back then during the development stage,"" BHP lab assistant Peter Ayers said. ""But, no, we had to go and make ourselves look like idiots in front of the whole world. Us and our lousy little pills both. Why?"" Ayers then began beating his fists into the sides of his head while staring at the floor, repeating, ""Why? Why, why, why, why, why?"" before being restrained by loved ones. Fellow BHP researcher Harlan Downing said that, in addition to treating depression, Cyntrex may have numerous other uses. ""There is a strong possibility,"" Downing said, ""that the particular disinhibitors activated by Cyntrex may be of great benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease."" He then admitted that the drug will not be ready for such use for some time, repeatedly hitting his forehead into a wall and gently mumbling under his breath. BHP's chief rival in the mood-altering drug field is Stafford Labs, manufacturer of Prozac. Stafford CEO Margaret Curry expressed faith that Prozac would maintain its position despite the new competition. ""We will emerge triumphant, for I am Margaret Curry, president of Stafford Labs!"" she said. ""My power is as of 50 CEOs! My marketing savvy is as of a legion of PR firms! My tricyclic monoinhibitor is a boon unto the people and a beacon unto the nations! My new promotional campaign to enhance brand awareness and increase market saturation of Prozac shall be cloaked in radiant beams of persuasive glory!"""
"'I May Be Hazardous To Your Health,' Warns Homicidal Surgeon General",4/02/97,3037,"WASHINGTON, DC—In his most strongly worded pronouncement yet, Surgeon General J. Putnam Andrews issued a stern warning to all U.S. citizens Monday that, if provoked, he may prove “seriously hazardous” to their health. “A number of recent clinical studies have shown that messing with me poses a significant health risk to any motherfucker who thinks he is man enough to try it,” a visibly agitated Andrews said at Monday’s press conference. “I would strongly advise all Americans not to even think about it.” According to Andrews, “Field data collected at several Washington, DC, bars last night demonstrates a strong causal link between getting in my face and the development of several potentially life-threatening conditions, including but not limited to: cracked skulls, ruptured chest cavities and severed spinal cords.” Andrews announced his support for a new, federally mandated warning label across his chest, which would advise those near him that a serious number may be done on their asses if they keep it up. “This is the only reliable manner in which Americans can be cautioned about the very real health risks posed by me,” he said. In addition to the new warning label, Andrews announced that an education program stressing the importance of generally avoiding him will tour the nation’s elementary schools starting next month. Andrews then unveiled the program’s theme song, “Stay The Hell Out Of His Goddamn Way”: “When J. Putnam comes around/play it safe and get the fuck out of town,” sang a visibly nervous “Trevor,” the rapping kangaroo who stars in the show. As helpful as the proposed program is expected to be, Andrews stressed that it is not enough. “It is up to families to take surgeon general safety and avoidance education into their own hands,” he said. “Don’t wait for your kids to ask about me. Approach them and talk to them now, because one day it may be too late.” Less than an hour after his controversial pronouncement, following a brutally violent altercation with a group of tobacco-industry lobbyists, Andrews fled the nation’s capital and has been missing ever since. Andrews is believed to be traveling with an elite platoon of highly trained surgeons, who remain intensely loyal to the Surgeon General’s command. “If you do see this man, use extreme caution. Do not attempt to confront him,” White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry warned. “The public is advised that approaching Andrews in any way could lead to ass-kickings, severe lung and heart problems, and low fetal birth weights among pregnant women.” Andrews is the first surgeon general to go rogue since May 1994, when Joycelyn Elders went berserk, telling media representatives that she does not believe schools should teach children that masturbation is wrong. A White House special-operatives squad was able to terminate Elders before she could do any further damage, but fear of an out-of-control surgeon general—an office that many government officials have long believed has “too much unchecked power”—has remained ever since."
Nobel Prize Committee Adds 'Most Ripped Abs' Category,3/19/97,3775,"STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN—The Alfred B. Nobel Foundation's annual awards ceremony was enhanced Friday with the addition of the first-ever Nobel Prize For Ripped Abs. The new category was established by the Nobel Committee to honor outstanding achievement in the areas of upper abs, lower abs and obliques. Of the thousands of scientists, authors and university professors from around the world who were nominated, the inaugural Nobel Prize For Ripped Abs was awarded to Laguna Beach, CA, personal trainer and mountain biking enthusiast Ron Seaver, 28. ""Thank you very much,"" Seaver said upon receiving the gold Nobel medallion from Sweden's King Karl Gustaf. ""Basically, what I try to do is five sets of 30 to 40 crunches every day, alternating between slow, low-reps of incline sit-ups to work the slow-twitch muscle fibers and quick, high-rep crunches to work the fast-twitch muscle fibers. In between sets I like to mix it up with cardiovascular work—cycling, swimming, even rollerblading."" Seaver then turned serious, adding: ""It's very important to take at least one day a week off. Down time is when your muscles actually do all of their rebuilding."" Nobel Committee members, including professors from the University of Helsinki, Yale University and the famed Karolinska Institute, were impressed with the angled, defined corners on Seaver's abs, and the visible sinew beneath his trim, toned ""six-pack."" Nobel Committee Chair Grueder Halstrüm, Fellow of the Danish Academy of Sciences in Copenhagen, said: ""Mr. Seaver has great abs. His tireless dedication to his abdominal region is apparent in a 'washboard stomach' that is more ripped than any other in the world of modern abs."" In his presentation speech to Seaver, King Gustaf said: ""Your ripped abs are an inspiration to all of mankind. They will get all the citizens of the world 'psyched' to work their own abs harder."" An appreciative Seaver told the assembled crowd that it was ""a great honor"" to receive the Nobel Prize. ""There are so many other people out there who would have been just as deserving of this award. My workout partner, Mitch, has incredible definition. Bruce Bloch, who works out at Gold's Gym over in Santa Cruz, is every bit as ripped as me, and he has even better symmetry."" Seaver also thanked his longtime mentor, Russian physicist Pavel Cherenkov, winner of the 1958 Nobel Prize For Physics, who died last December. ""Pavel taught me everything I know,"" a visibly buffed Seaver said. ""He taught me to keep my knees together, elbows in, and never to cheat by anchoring my legs. I just know he's up there somewhere, totally juiced right now."" Moved to tears, Seaver stepped down from the platform and carbo-loaded. Many of the world's leading political and intellectual figures in attendance at the ceremony were both moved and motivated by Seaver's acceptance speech. ""After seeing Mr. Seaver up there, I realize that my stomach could use some work,"" German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said. ""Ever since re-unification I have been making excuses, saying that I do not have time to worry about getting rid of my love handles. Well, I can ignore this problem no longer."" ""If I do not start doing sit-ups soon,"" said Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 78, ""I will not be in shape for the coming swimsuit season."" Men's Health reporter Bradley Simmons covered the Nobel Prize ceremony for the magazine. ""Seaver was the clear choice in the Ripped Abs Category,"" Simmons said. ""His abs are totally cut. Look for him on the cover of the next issue of Men's Health in connection with our late-breaking piece on how to flatten your tummy in just 10 weeks."" Seaver plans to use his $950,000 prize money to travel throughout the Third World teaching the poor how to add definition to their abs."
Taco Bell Launches New 'Morning After' Burrito,3/12/97,4117,"PURCHASE, NY—Hot on the heels of last week’s FDA approval, on Monday PepsiCo subsidiary Taco Bell launched its controversial “morning after” burrito, a zesty, Mexican-style entree that prevents unwanted pregnancies if ingested within 36 hours following intercourse. Developed by a team of top Taco Bell gynecologists, the $1.99 “ContraceptiMelt” burrito creates an inhospitable environment within the womb, causing fertilized ovum tissue to be flushed from the body. Also available are ContraceptiMelt Supremes, featuring sour cream and extra cheese. Taco Bell officials are excited about the offering. “In the past, before Roe v. Wade, young women literally had to ‘make a run for the border’ to terminate an unwanted pregnancy,” Taco Bell public relations director Grant Lesko said. “But now, women can make that same run for the border at over 7,300 convenient locations right in their own hometowns.” Possible side effects of the new birth-control snack item include weight gain, stomach upset and gas, the same as with all other Taco Bell products. “The new ContraceptiMelt is a safe, effective alternative to traditional forms of birth control that must be administered before intercourse,” Lesko said. “Plus, it’s delicious.” Customers who wish to purchase a ContraceptiMelt will be required to meet briefly for consultation with a registered Taco Bell counselor/cashier. The counselor will ring up the customer’s order and collect money for it, then provide change, before being allowed to administer the ContraceptiMelt. Additionally, a five- to ten-minute waiting period may be necessary during high-volume “busy periods” in the restaurant, depending on the length of the line. “Late afternoon, like 3 p.m., is usually a good time to come in,” said Gerry Frankel, an Arlington, VA, Taco Bell counselor/cashier. While the new burrito is legal and available in all 50 states, parental-consent laws in 37 states require minors who wish to purchase the ContraceptiMelt to obtain permission from a parent or legal guardian—unless they order a side of Cinnamon Crisps and a large beverage. Taco Bell vice-president of product research and development Marvin Sekuler expects the new product to be tremendously successful. “All of our test marketing and demographic research indicates that among 14- to 22-year-old females, there is great demand for a quick, relatively painless termination of unwanted pregnancy via spontaneously induced rejection of fertilized, pre-fetal tissue from the uterine canal,” Sekuler said. “Plus, 14- to 22-year-olds love delicious, Mexican-style fast-food products. We’re thrilled that our newest menu item can meet both these important needs in a lip-smacking, tasty way.” While he hopes that many young women will purchase the new burrito, Sekuler stressed that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is an individual one. “We are in no way advocating any particular view on this most sensitive of issues,” he said. “We simply want to offer this option. And, of course, we fully respect our customers who decide to carry their babies to term. In fact, I’d like to point out that Taco Bell offers a wide variety of non-contraceptive menu items that can provide the crucial nutrients—such as mild sauce, shredded cheddar and beef—that a growing fetus needs to develop properly.” Sekuler noted that every pregnacy terminated by the Taco Bell ContraceptiMelt comes with a special guarantee. “If any one of our customers becomes pregnant after consuming our new burrito, the Taco Bell Corporation will, guaranteed, hire that person to work for us at $6.25 per hour,” he said. “Taco Bell’s competitive, above-minimum-wage salaries; flexible schedules; and fun, team-oriented atmosphere make it the ideal place for a young, single mother, enabling her to provide for herself and her children with uninsured subsistence living.” Pending FDA approval, Taco Bell plans to follow up the ContraceptiMelt with the RU-486 MexiCarriage Deluxe. Already legal in France, the MexiCarriage Deluxe costs $1.59 if purchased during the first MexiMester, $1.79 during the second and $1.99 during the third."
Study: Depression Hits Losers Hardest,3/05/97,4059,"PALO ALTO, CA—According to a report released Monday by Stanford's Institute For Psychotherapeutic Study, depression, America's leading mental illness, hits losers worse than any other segment of society. Losers, sad excuses for human beings who have no reason to feel good about themselves or their failed, miserable lives, are approximately 25 times as likely to suffer the emotionally crippling effects of depression as any other group researched, the study claims. Worse yet, the prospects for successful treatment of depression among the loser populace are ""poor at best,"" the study found. The reason: Most losers are such hopeless lost causes that they can never get a life, no matter how hard they try, and are ""doomed to repeat their mistakes forever, living out their pathetic existence as little more than human garbage."" ""People who are depressed are gripped by painful feelings of shame, hopelessness and low self-esteem,"" said Dr. Anne Wyler-Hustad, head of the Stanford team. ""Losers are much more likely to internalize these emotions, as they are miserable little nothings, devoid of any value as people."" Noted therapist Eli Wasserbaum agreed. ""Because they are so inherently inferior to regular people, many losers feel—quite correctly—that their lives are not worth living,"" Wasserbaum said. ""Nobody cares about them, they are alone, they can't hold down a job, they have no money. Even their own families hate them. Life has passed them by. What's the point in their even going on?"" According to the Stanford study, losers are five times more likely to suffer from negative sexual self-images than non-losers, usually because they are fat and ugly, and nobody in their right mind would ever want to date them. Further, negative feelings such as despair, self-loathing and hopelessness are three times as common among go-nowhere lowlife losers than among normal people who are not worthless as human beings. The study also indicates that, because nobody would miss them if they died, losers are nine times as likely to attempt suicide as worthwhile people. ""From the true loser's point of view, the compulsion to inflict self-harm seems to be 'the only way out.' This is true,"" Wyler-Hustad said. ""Lord knows why they don't just do us all a favor and blow their heads off once and for all. I know I would if I were a loser like that."" But is there any hope for these losers? Can they get better? According to Stanford researchers, the answer is a resounding no. ""The depressed patient suffers from severe, delusional feelings of worthlessness,"" the study read. ""But through therapy, the majority of those people are able to overcome their depression by slowly discovering that these negative beliefs are not true. In the case of losers, however, such negative self-images are not delusional, but instead reflect the truth about their lack of worth. This makes the loser's chances of suffering depression far more likely, and their prognosis for recovery slim to none."" With over one million Americans on Prozac, depression remains America's leading mental illness. But while most patients can expect to benefit from the drug, mental health experts agree that losers will not be helped by prescription drug therapy or, for that matter, anything at all. ""Losers, despite their profound, constant state of despair, are hated by others as much as they hate themselves,"" said Theodore Foti, director of the famed Rochester Institute For Mental Health. ""They have no friends because they are, quite simply, too pathetic and useless for anyone to care about. How could anyone possibly expect a little pill to cure a problem like that? Give me a break."" Because of their severe, profound ""loserdom,"" realistic treatment options for depressed losers are almost nil, the Stanford report concludes. ""The only treatment that makes any sense is loathing and rejection,"" Wyler-Hustad noted. ""It is only logical that stupid, fat, ugly, bed-wetting, crybaby losers be shunned as outcasts and be treated with the hatred and disrespect they so richly deserve."""
Pain To Reach New Levels,1/15/97,3522,"WASHINGTON, DC—Though already extremely painful, the physical sensation of pain will become markedly greater in the coming months, continuing to rise exponentially throughout 1997, sources say. According to a recent report released by the U.S. Department of Agony and Suffering, even levels of pain currently considered unbearable will seem mild compared to the beyond-excruciating jolts of pain soon to be endured by Americans throughout the nation. ""Greater pain than ever is on the way,"" said Erno Broussard, Department of Agony and Suffering spokesperson. ""Say, for example, you accidentally step on a thumbtack. In the past, that would have hurt enough to make you hop around the room smarting for several seconds, swearing at the top of your lungs. But under the new, higher pain levels, such an injury will result in a white-hot, blinding sensation of explosive force ripping through your entire body for several hours, as if you were being slowly shredded alive by the multiple razor-arms of murderous, cybernetic death-drones."" ""A simple, everyday tension headache,"" Broussard continued, ""will be like having a blunt railroad spike sledge-hammered into your forehead by a drooling, ham-fisted, idiot man-child while your wife and children are shot through the back of the neck gangland execution-style as you watch helplessly."" ""A full-blown case of hemorrhoidal flare-up,"" Broussard noted, ""will feel like a 30-megaton thermonuclear device is being detonated deep within your rectal region."" The pharmaceutical industry is mobilizing rapidly in response to the new pain levels, creating substantially more potent over-the-counter painkillers such as SuperMegaBufferin and UltraHyperMaxiMidol. The new drugs will sell for $800-900 a bottle and will be ""capable of sedating a team of oxen for several weeks."" Many experts feel that such painkillers, however potent they may be, will ultimately prove ineffective. ""How could any drug possibly fight such pain?"" said Pat Curtis of the National Pain Institute. ""After all, we're talking about levels of pain where scraping your elbow will feel like a concussion shrapnel grenade is being set off in the center of your brain, causing your eyeballs to feel like they're melting in their sockets while your internal organs rupture into a liquefied state, bursting wetly from every orifice."" According to Pain Institute co-director Barry Eckerd, even non-painful sensations like slipping into a set of silk sheets will be akin to ""having all of one's flesh sandpapered directly from the surface areas of the body that are touching the material."" Likewise, hugging a teddy bear, wiping one's closed eyes with a moistened towelette, and smelling fresh bread will evoke being quartered by red-hot iron battle-axes; having your face eaten by rats; and firing an explosive-tipped rocket dart into your sinus cavities, respectively. Eckerd went on to point out that even listening to him speak, under the new pain levels, would cause any sane man to tear the faces of screaming puppies with his teeth. ""I wish we could say there was something we could all do to prepare for all this,"" noted pain therapist Eli Wasserbaum said. ""Some have suggested using the body's own natural endorphins to create a 'neural-block' of the brain's sensory receptors, or some other such thing. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that's simply impossible. There just isn't any hope of deliverance, for any of us. A nightmarish hellscape of unrelenting, endless agony awaits us all in the very near future."""
Secondhand Smoke Linked To Secondhand Coolness,10/22/96,3588,"WINSTON, NC—Americans have known for years that smoking is a direct cause of coolness. But a recent study funded by R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris and several other cigarette conglomerates proves conclusively that the cool effects of smoking are not limited to the smoker. According to the study, secondhand smoke is a leading cause of coolness, and is only slightly less cool than actual smoking. As a result of the study, cigarette companies are encouraging non-smokers to frequent smoky bars and make friends with smokers. The companies are also speaking out against laws that mandate separate non-smoking areas in public places. ""We are only acting in the interests of the public at large,"" R.J. Reynolds spokesperson Ron Gronfeld said. ""We're not saying non-smokers are going to die as a result of their actions, but we do want to make sure they know they're not as cool as they could be."" Gronfeld referred to a ""three-level progression"" of coolness that non-smokers experienced in the study. Level one could be observed as soon as the non-smoker sat down at a barstool near a person enjoying a delicious cigarette. ""Even the nerdiest subject we could find somehow appeared cool when interacting with his smoking partner,"" Gronfeld said. ""Just the fact that the subject was brave enough to breathe deadly secondhand smoke established him as a hip, freethinking individual, the kind of person who might one day run with the bulls in Pamplona."" Level two begins after a non-smoker has been in a smoke-filled environment for at least an hour. At this point, the non-smoker's clothes begin to stink of smoke, and he develops a dry, hacking cough. Bronchial fits are directly proportional to mucus overproduction, respiratory cyanosis and coolness. The smelly clothing leads to coolness because the nonsmoker smells to others as if he smokes two or more packs a day, which is a very cool thing to do. Level three occurs once the non-smoker admits to himself that smoking is cool, and then starts smoking himself. ""Even if a former non-smoker only smokes in bars or social situations, we feel as if we have scored a victory,"" Gronfeld said. Smokers across the country feel vindicated by the study, claiming it proves what they have believed all along. ""It's an exciting time to be a smoker,"" University of Virginia freshman Gina Pongres said. ""It made me look grown- up in high school, and now that I'm older, it just makes me look cool."" Her boyfriend, sophomore Tom Willard, agrees. ""She always looks sexy smoking at the bars,"" he said. ""I myself don't smoke, but I sure feel cool when I'm with Gina."" David Prochnow, president of United Smokers of America, says there has never been such a good time to seek out the friendship of smokers. ""Cigarette companies need our help,"" he said. ""They want to get Third World countries addicted to American cigarettes, but that's going to take money. Now that this study has been released, I'm confident that even nonsmokers will make donations to cigarette companies, thanking them for the gift of coolness."" Prochnow went on to praise the tobacco companies for adding freon, nicotine and dozens of other poisonous substances to tobacco. ""Anyone would be seen as cool if their bodies were strong enough to handle even one of those chemicals. But smokers, being the coolest people around, have no problem breathing all of them at once,"" he said. ""And breathing those chemicals secondhand is almost as cool."" R.J. Reynolds plans to use the study's findings as evidence this fall, when it petitions the government to encourage smoking among newborns."
Radioactive Yeast Infection Transforms Local Woman into Superpowered Crimefighter,8/07/96,3404,"METROPOLIS—In a transformation that has baffled nuclear physicists and gynecologists alike, an area woman recently gained superhuman powers through an accidental radioactive yeast infection. Though her real identity remains a mystery, to the millions of honest, law-abiding citizens of Metropolis who live in constant fear of crime, she goes by one name: Yeastwoman. ""Evil-doers beware!"" the statuesque superhero announced via satellite from her secret underground Fortress of Yeast-itude. ""My powerful yeast ray causes burning, itching and cheesy discharges from the genital area, and I will not hesitate to use it on those who do wrong."" Police first became aware of Yeastwoman last week when an officer on patrol stumbled across one of Metropolis' most notorious arch-villains, the evil Professor Prostate, bound and gagged in the wharf district. Upon closer inspection, a single-use applicator of Monistat-7 was discovered near his side. ""We saw this as the 'calling card' of a new, powerful ally in our war on crime,"" Metropolis Chief of Police William Brautigan said. ""Her bacterial brand of justice will spread quickly throughout the city."" Each day, more and more criminals are finding out about the formidable new crimefighter first-hand. ""I had just ripped a purse off some old lady's shoulder and was running down an alley when Yeastwoman caught up to me,"" said Jay DiFrenzi, a repeat offender now in police custody. ""There was this burst of light, and suddenly it felt like my crotch was on fire. The burning sensation was too intense to fight."" At yesterday's press conference, Yeastwoman discussed the origin of her powers. ""One year ago, I agreed to participate in a top-secret government testing program for a new tampon containing the experimental absorbing agent Plutonium-235,"" she said. ""But during one of the experiments, something went horribly wrong. There was an explosion, and before long, my discharge was 200 times more powerful than that of an average woman."" ""I went to my gynecologist, Dr. Meyer, to have it checked out,"" she continued. ""But when one vaginal twitch sent him crashing through the wall, I knew I had been transformed."" Ironically, the same gynecologist who attempted to cure Yeastwoman of her infection is now her worst enemy. After flying through the wall, Dr. Meyer smashed into a cart of toxic pap smear samples that were being disposed of. Horrifically disfigured by the accident, James Meyer is now Dr. Gynosaur, a stunted sociopath whose bodily functions are serviced by a gigantic metal speculum exoskeleton. Dr. Gynosaur vowed to make destroying Yeastwoman his life's goal. ""Yeastwoman! I and my hordes of subhuman Smegmalons will ruin you, just as you ruined my once-beautiful face!"" said Gynosaur at his own press conference. ""Re-venge will be mine when you attempt to stop my assault on the Women's Health Center! Take a long look in the mirror, dear! One last look before I deform you with my speculum pincers!"" ""Such evil cannot be faced alone,"" Yeastwoman said yesterday, responding to Gynosaur's statement. ""That is why I have chosen a partner in my war against crime, Urinary Tract Infection Girl."" City officials have given Yeastwoman and Urinary Tract Infection Girl full rein in their crimefighting efforts. Support has also come from local businesses like Bob Blastwick Ford, who donated a brand new '97 Taurus to serve as the Yeastmobile."
United Nations Pledges $1.2 Billion In Indigestion Relief For U.S.,8/07/96,3948,"In what has been called the largest gastrointestinal rescue effort in history, the United Nations allocated $1.2 billion in antacid relief yesterday for the indigestion-wracked nation of America. ""There is great suffering in America, where every day people face the terrible pain of stomach upset, heartburn, and problem gas,"" a statement released by the General Assembly read. ""Most members of the global community, who do not have to live with the constant threat of massive overeating as Americans do, cannot even imagine what it is like. We can turn a blind eye no longer."" Dubbed ""Operation Soothe and Coat,"" the massive C-130 airlift is expected to provide millions of American indigestion sufferers with cartons of precious, life-giving antacids by week's end. Much of the $1.2 billion will also go toward emergency helicopter and truck mobilization, distributing alkalides to a network of temporary stomach trouble ""crisis centers"" set up across the American countryside. ""Help is on the way,"" said Colonel Obiabwe Buna*!dab, wing commander of the Kenyan delegation to the international airlift operation. He said that although he had never been to America, he had seen much U.S. television and understood how much pain indigestion was causing the nation. ""All men are brothers,"" Buna*!dab added. U.N. officials say the decision is a response to a recent study ranking the U.S. first in bloating and excess gas build-up, and fourth and second, respectively, in lower abdominal pain and diarrhea. ""Statistics show many Americans 'pay for it later' after a hot, spicy meal. It is shameful that in this day and age the Americans must go without the gas-absorbing medications they need,"" one volunteer remarked. ""We just want to do whatever we can to help them get better—one fizzy little pellet at a time."" The organizational tasks facing the U.N. relief task force are daunting. Workers from every corner of the globe have been called in for special duty, mobilizing the relief effort and distributing the antacids as efficiently as possible. ""The key here is speed,"" said Chile's Salvador Aguilera, co-chair of the operation. ""These people don't just need relief, they need quick relief. They need relief with a capital 'R.' They need to ease the pain caused by heartburn and stomach upset immediately. Otherwise, they may have trouble sleeping. This can lead to additional problems, particularly if they have a big presentation at the office the next day."" According to experts, it is not known how many people in America suffer from indigestion, partly because the number of unreported cases far outweighs the number that receive medical care. ""The actual number of Americans with digestion-related discomfort—particularly among the millions whose dietary staples include donuts, canned meat products and microwaveables—is staggering, probably higher than in all other industrialized nations combined,"" said Mtume Mofeisi, president of AfriCares, a Rwanda-based organization dedicated to helping the overfed throughout the First World. ""Thank God for the U.N.,"" said indigestion sufferer Bob Halloran, of Des Moines, IA. ""I was terrified that no one would hear my cries. But at last, the pain is gone. Now I have no need to fear that my illness may result in decreased productivity at work."" Halloran received a case of Mylanta Extra-Strength through Operation Soothe and Coat. ""My doctor said Mylanta,"" he added. Despite the success of the relief effort thus far, U.N. task force workers stress that indigestion is only one of many problems facing America. ""Many of the Americans we've been trying to help are badly undersupplied with convenient snack food options,"" said Carlos Santiago of Honduras, speaking from the U.N. relief camp based near Rochester, NY. ""Lower back pain also continues to be a problem. And every day, we see thousands who have kitchen remodeling and television repair needs we are simply not equipped to address."""
HMO Targets Blacks with 'Rapping Good' Health Campaign,7/09/96,702,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN—Advertising executives say they have hit upon an ingenious new way to target blacks: Mount a campaign that co-opts their own language and musical style. “Many blacks enjoy ‘rapping’ music,” said Briggs & Adams Advertising president Sherman Roe, who developed the campaign for HospCare HMO. “And what better way to tap into their market than by ‘rapping’ good health to them?” Roe’s campaign employs the use of a black teenager doing a “rap” for good health. Billboards of the campaign have been put up in black neighborhoods, and radio and TV ads have aired on black-oriented stations in the area. Roe predicts area blacks will, as a result, be “‘rapping’ happy with their HMO service.”"
Uptight Matron Enjoys Handful of Pills,4/30/96,741,"SCOTSDALE, AZ—Georgette McHue, a Scotsdale-area uptight matron, enjoyed a handful of colorful pills yesterday, swallowing them down after dinner with a glass of water. The estimated 39 gel-capped pills, an assortment of doctor-prescribed medications designed to fortify her diet and calm a recently diagnosed nervous condition, were described by McHue as “very important” to her continued good health. “I feel more spring in my step than when I was in my 20s,” she said. She is slated to take the same dosage every day at dinner time until prescribed otherwise. “The blue one is for calcium, the orange one is for fiber, the pink one is estrogen, the big yellow one is for shingles, and the white ones help me sleep better,” McHue explained."
Cholera Outbreak Makes Americans Glad They Don’t Live in Africa,4/16/96,788,"Lagos—The major cholera outbreak that has ravaged the Nigerian city of Lagos and surrounding rural villages has many Americans feeling very glad they do not live in Africa. “I am glad I live in Erie, PA, and not in Lagos or one of its surrounding villages,” American Carl Neesbrum said. Neesbrum, reflecting the view of many Americans, said he is also very glad he and his three children are not victims of cholera, a water-borne bacteria that inflicts explosive diarrhea, paralyzation and, ultimately, death on its victims. When told that Africans are dying by the hundreds each day and that simple, anti-bacteria vaccinations for the outbreak are unaffordable to the impoverished victims there, Neesbrun added, “I think I will go to Best Buy today and purchase a program for my CD-ROM.”"
American Cancer Society Unveils 1.2 Megaton Anti-Cancer Missile,4/16/96,2996,"The American Cancer Society unveiled a promising new weapon in the war against cancer yesterday, a 1.2-megaton anti-cancer missile. The powerful missile, a converted nuclear warhead fitted with special cancer-eradicating plutonium, has been tested vigorously on cancer patients on a top-secret military atoll near Guam, with a 100 percent cure rate. Pending FDA and Pentagon approval, the weapon could be used on U.S. cancer patients as soon as May. “This is our boldest and most effective strike yet against this life-taking disease,” ACS chairman and former McDonnell Douglas CEO William McNair said. “Our island tests indicate that when the missile is fired at a cancer patient, the disease is instantly eradicated.”
 The treatment will work not unlike a medium-range ballistic nuclear missile. It will be computer-locked on its target and launched from an underground silo in Nevada. The missile’s curative powers trigger on impact, exploding with a force 400 times more powerful than that of the 1945 Hiroshima bomb and destroying all cancer cells within a 35-square-mile radius.
 The missile is said to have some side-effects, including nausea, headaches and the eradication of all other forms of life within a 35-square mile radius.
 Through March, when testing stopped due to seismic disturbances in the Pacific rim, the $40 million surface-to-patient missile had a 100% success rate, besting such commonly used treatments as chemotherapy (36%), radiation (41%), surgical removal (27%), homeopathy (11%), and prayer (61%).
 “In every case, save one or two, the treatment has worked,” McNair said. “And, in the cases when the treatment failed, it was only because the patients were not in the designated strike area when the missiles hit.”
 Cancer patients expressed hope at the prospect of a new treatment with such a high success rate.
 “Though my skin cancer is in remission, I am excited to try this new treatment,” cancer patient Judith Miles said. “Why wait the few more months when I can now eliminate it in one fell swoop?”
 Added Derrick Thorner, who suffers from lung cancer: “My cancer is very serious, so I will probably encourage them to use higher mega-tonnage.”
 Skeptics of the treatment have expressed concern with the side-effects of the new technology, particularly its tendency to destroy all life and property in the vicinity of the patient.
 “Our initial reports indicate that if a patient was treated in, say, New York, where over 14 million people are concentrated in a small area, many if not all of the 14 million could be destroyed along with the cancer cells,” New England Journal of Medicine editor Dr. Daphne Lehman said. “Whether that is too large a price to pay to defeat this deadly disease remains to be seen.”
 Added American Medical Association chair Dr. Fran Stern: “Look at Jonas Salk. He is a legend in the medical community. But when he introduced the notion of killing every first-born child to reduce polio, people said he was a genocidal maniac.”"
