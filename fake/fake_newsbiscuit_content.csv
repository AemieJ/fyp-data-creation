US CONGRESS AGREES TO ADOPT CARRY ON STYLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM,831,"President Barack Obama is today celebrating the news that Congress has agreed to support his proposals to establish an NHS style healthcare programme in the US, on the proviso it closely resembles the Carry On films. After persuading Congress to watch Carry On Doctor, Carry On Nurse and Carry On Matron, Obama’s plans finally won over his critics. ‘I saw one man who’d had an operation on a very private area just days before leap out of bed when a young nurse came to check on him. And the level of attention some of the male doctors were giving their female patients was unparalleled,’ commented Republican Congressman Joe Wilson. ‘I’m booking myself in for appendectomy and started practising double entendres already. We’ll have to wait to see how the system ‘goes down’ with the American people. Ooh no! Matron!” he chuckled."
‘SELFLESS GENEROSITY’ AS VACCINE LEFTOVERS TO GO TO POOR INSTEAD OF THE BIN,788,"In an act of selfless generosity the world’s richest countries have decided to donate their unwanted, leftover vaccines to poor countries instead of just binning them. This selfless act will of course come after all men, women, children, dogs, cats and hamsters have received at least three doses of the vaccine at which point the world’s poorest can have a go at protecting their elderly and vulnerable. Kindness and sacrifice on this scale will surely bode well for any future discussions with poorer nations around climate change targets, explains Boris Johnson: ‘What more proof is needed that we are all in it together?’ Poorer nations are yet to comment as they are a little busy trying to stop people dying, stop the virus spreading and prop up their inadequate healthcare systems."
£4 BILLION CUT TO FOREIGN AID ‘100% JUSTIFIED’ AS BORIS NEEDS NEW DOWNSTAIRS TOILET,1127,"Countries around the world have united in their support of the government’s £4 billion foreign aid cut, since Boris has explained his downstairs lav needs “a bit of a revamp”. Despite some initial reservations – which saw some ‘doom-mongers’ point out that many of the world’s poorest countries are still in the grip of a deadly pandemic and lack even the most basic life saving necessities like oxygen and sanitation – once Boris explained the next stage of his thrilling home improvements plan all criticism was silenced. Head of Healthcare and Hospitals in India told us: ‘I was sceptical at first but now I cannot believe how closed minded I was. Yes, people are dying every few minutes here, yes, a little cash would have been useful to ensure our poorest children survived to adulthood….but my word, when I heard BoJo needed a new bog, I took it all back. The man needs the best. I don’t care where that money comes from.’ Various public sector employees, including nurses, teachers and care workers, have now offered to take a 50% pay cut as there is some indication Boris may also want to ‘do up’ the east-wing lav too."
“NO WAY! I DON’T BELIEVE IT!”: REACTION TO SHOCKING NEWS TORIES ARE ALL CORRUPT,1066,"The general public have voiced their complete and utter shock at the revelation that quite a lot of Tory MPs are liars and only interested in helping themselves. Julie, a lifelong Cameron supporter, told us: “I just broke down in tears when I heard about Greensill, I couldn’t believe it was happening. Dave always seemed like such a top bloke, his referendum on Brexit was obviously a great idea and panned out superbly. He did a fab job with the NHS – it was clear we needed to divert money away from healthcare and towards tax breaks for the super-rich. He was your typical humble, trustworthy, down to earth Etonian.” Shockwaves have reverberated across the UK with many now saying they will think twice about voting Tory next time, though will definitely still vote Tory in the end. Despite her shock and sadness, Julie says she still believes the conservatives are the right party to lead Britain in the years to come. “It’s not as though the current government are anything like the others – BoJo, Hancock, Patel – you couldn’t find a more trustworthy bunch.”"
JOHNSON AND STARMER ANNOUNCE MUCH ANTICIPATED ENGAGEMENT,1334,"Wedding bells and cash registers are set to ring out, as the Prime Minister and The Leader of the Opposition look set to seal the knot and tighten the noose. They have finally decided to be joined in holy matrimony and mutual hatred of the unions; while they are already joined together by exactly the same policies and the same levels of ineptitude. The Johnson family said: ‘Boris may have played the field in his day, but only Keir has screwed the entire Labour membership’. Relatives of Starmer confirmed: ‘We are so lucky to welcome a Tory into the family and its great to have Boris join us as well Previously they had clashed in the Commons over their handling of the NHS crisis, labelled by the public as Captain Hindsight and Major Disaster – although both men take their orders from an enlisted soldier called Private Healthcare. Yet from those early disagreements a passion was kindled, a passion for Brexit and closing all zoos. Their top priorities are 1) an unwavering loyalty to Rupert Murdoch and 2) see 1). In fact, they have so much in common – be it their success in the fight against male pattern baldness or that they both think Blacks Lives Matter was just for Christmas. Asked if they had already consummated the marriage, a spokeswoman confirmed that Keir had been letting Boris have his wicked way for months."
RUSSIAN HEALTH STAFF SHORTAGE SEES COVID JABS ADMINISTERED BY RE-TRAINED ASSASSINS,1753,"In an effort to save the roll-out of a ‘world-beating’ corona-virus vaccine program threatened by a lack of qualified healthcare professionals, Russia is re-deploying secret-agents to make up the short-fall. “Originally our reputation as champions of humanitarian causes didn’t translate into the demand for vaccinations we expected. Until the intervention of the KGB, the population was bewilderingly reluctant to subject themselves to State-sponsored mass injections. But, now we’re a victim of our own success,” laughed Rosa Klebb, Chief of the newly-made ‘Directorate of Not Killing People’. “Serendipitously, these same…er…public sector workers are highly-trained and have a set of transferable skills ideally suited to their new role as community vaccinators” said “For a single dose, after a period of covert tracking, we’ll either sneak up and inject the vaccine from behind with a vaccine-tipped umbrella, or put it in their tea or Widow’s Kiss cocktail when they’re not looking, leaving what’s left in a park bench to inoculate an unsuspecting child, amorous couple or police-officer. “Alternatively we apply it to the door-knob of their front door, or sneak it in pellet-form under their car-seat. “In a case where two doses are needed, we use two agents running up from either side, each opening a briefcase full of pressurised vaccine spray while the victim…er, I mean patient…is distracted. “Our agents also have excellent bedside manner, able to put people at ease regaling them with stories of their travels to Salisbury cathedral, or else with nerve-gas. “Yes, yes, as you imagine we do occasionally confuse the vaccine with novachok, with hilarious results. This is regrettable but will save time later during the forthcoming ‘purge’.”"
GREATEST GENERATION APOLOGISES TO MILLENNIALS FOR FATHERING BOOMERS,2083,"Britain’s Greatest Generation of 1910-1924, which went through six years of brutal warfare to defeat Nazi Germany and continued to endure food rationing for eight more, has admitted – in most cases posthumously – that it did rather drop a bollock when it came to producing its long-term replacement. ‘Our bad. We meant well but we got it wrong,’ admitted the ghost of Private Sidney Dobson (1919-1995), a cheery former dock labourer from Dagenham. During the war, Dobson spent five days being strafed by German planes on the beaches of Dunkirk before being evacuated and was later injured by a mortar bomb at the Anzio bridgehead, before finally returning home in 1945. ‘We wanted our kids to be proud of us of course but we also wanted them to grow up with free healthcare and not to have to go through another war like we did. Now, when I look down and see my son Colin wearing a poppy the size of Oxfordshire every year and banging on about the Battle of Britain like he was manning the Spitfires himself, it does boil my piss a bit,’ Dobson said. ‘You were born in 1947, you little twerp. You grew up with the welfare state; you got a well-paid job at Ford’s, despite being as thick as two short planks; you got given a four-bed council house, which you later bought for threepence-ha’penny; and now you’re sitting on your comfortably retired arse all day, moaning about youngsters spending what little they have left after paying their rent on milky coffee, while repeatedly voting to take their whole future from them. Muppet.’ Added Dobson’s father Reginald (1898-1919), from the ‘Lost Generation’ of 1883-1900: ‘You think Sid’s lot had it bad? I was shot through the thigh at the Somme, patched up and sent out to get gassed at Passchendaele and when I got home, I found my wife was pregnant by another bloke. Before I could even work out what to do, I died of the Spanish Flu and I never even got to meet my ‘son’. Oh yeah, sorry Sid, that was you actually…’ Dobson’s cousin Albert (1934-2014), from the ‘Silent Generation’ of 1925-1945, was invited to comment but declined."
AMERICA’S POPULATION ‘TOO SMALL’ TO SUSTAIN HIGH-QUALITY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES,1641,"It’s a problem familiar to sports fan across the globe. Surinam just doesn’t have enough professional baseball players to make the World Series; Cambodia’s footballers have never made the World Cup finals; Trinidad & Tobago struggles every four years to qualify for the Winter Olympics. A similar phenomenon has been found in politics. The United States of America, despite its plucky bravado and excellent teeth, simply doesn’t have enough people to be able to put two high-calibre opponents together every four years for an election. ‘It’s just a numbers thing,’ said weirdly coiffed pollster Frank Luntz. ‘To be able to find two candidates, each with intelligence, charisma, normal-sized hands, human hair and the ability to stay awake for long periods, you’d need a population of, ooh, let me think, about a trillion? Trillion sounds about right.’ This November will see a particularly dismal competition, with an orange fascist competing with a narcoleptic pensioner. It’s America’s version of tramp-fighting – two losers slugging it out to be crowned the Least Bad Candidate. It wasn’t always like this. In the 1960s America was highly regarded for putting men on the moon and hosing down protesters with water cannons. Those were the Golden Years, when beautiful women would sleep with the President voluntarily. Since then the picture has soured. Most Americans don’t have basic healthcare provision, half the population is so poorly educated that they think Jesus spoke English and Piers Morgan is taken seriously. ‘Whatever the outcome in November, one thing is certain,’ Luntz said. ‘We’re all as f*cked as a Bill Clinton intern.’"
"TO COMMUTE, OR NOT TO COMMUTE?",1640,"To commute, or not to commute, that is the question:
Whether ’tis nobler on the train to suffer
The hacks and hawks of outrageous coughing,
Or to take hankie against a sea of phlegm
And by flapping, deflect it. To succumb- to mask,
Ever more; and by masking up to with relief end
The frowns and the thousand accusatory stares
That unmasked face is subject to: ’tis an approbation
To be shared on Facebook. To snooze on the 7:44, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to snore- ay, there’s mortification:
For in that sleep of commuting what drool may come,
When we have shuffled along this crowded platform,
Must give us hives- ah, there’s the replacement bus service
That makes calamity of so futile an expedition.
For who would bear the crush and germs of rush-hour,
The timetable’s wrong, the ticket office’s snub,
The mind the gap, the door’s delay,
The un-distancing of the office, and the self-control
That patient reloading of the Zoom call takes,
When who themselves might risk to mute it
For a sweary tirade? Who would Tescos bear,
To grunt and sweat under bagfuls of shopping,
But that the dread of something akin to Leicester,
The locked-down city, into whose centre
No workers go, stifles the grumbles,
And makes us rather bear those idiots we have
Than vote in others that lie and soundbite less?
Thus Twitter does make hypocrites of us all,
And thus the native character of stiff upper lip
Is papered o’er with the alluring opiate of furlough,
And healthcare workers of great sacrifice and dedication
With wicked disregard their cabinet ministers turn away
And forfeit any respect and integrity. Bonnet-tip and apologies to Shakespeare"
HOMEOWNERS TO RECEIVE £5K IF THEY PRETEND TORIES HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH COVID-19,1818,"Hundreds of thousands of homeowners across England are set to receive vouchers of up to £5K if they are willing to pretend that the government have done a great job tackling the Coronavirus, with the most sceptical receiving an additional £5k to help them overcome their cynicism. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out plans for the £2bn grant scheme and will confirm that homeowners will be able to spend the money on new loft insulation, solar panels or just piss it all up against the wall at a local boozer. ‘This is an exciting new initiative that will help the public take a more considered view of our handling of the Covid-19 healthcare crisis’ said Sunak. ‘This money shouldn’t be considered as a bribe, we’re just inviting people who have been critical of the government’s approach to reassess their view while picturing themselves lying on a beach on the Costa Del Sol getting slowly pissed on taxpayers cash’. The move has been broadly welcomed by the public. ‘I’ve been super-critical of the government’s disastrous handling of the Covid-19 crisis’ says York man Fenton Barnes. ‘I was ranting on Twitter just the other day about their piss-poor performance – 65000 excess deaths, lack of proper PPE and a complete absence of accountability. Then Rishi Sunak offered me five grand and I began to realise that they’ve probably done their best in very difficult circumstances and maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt’. ‘I mean who amongst us can honestly say that they haven’t caused tens of thousands of avoidable deaths through gross incompetence? Not me. I’ll certainly give it some more thought while the family and I are on the flight to Disneyland next month’. ‘We wanted to take mum with us but she died in her care home last week. Bloody government… oops, I mean bloody care workers’."
LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP DESTROYED BY PAIN-IN-THE-ARSE FACEBOOK UPDATES,2344,"A woman from Harlow has seen all feelings of warmth and friendship for a childhood friend corrode into disdain, disgust and hatred due to his incessant inane and pompous Facebook updates. ‘I’ve known Ben since I was eight, and have always enjoyed a trip to the pub with him,’ explained Stephanie Crowe, 27. ‘But ever since I’ve been looking at his Facebook page I can’t even look at him face to face without wanting to glass the up-his-own-arse fucker. See how he’d like to ‘share’ checking in to local A & E with 314 of his closest friends and family.’ Ben Simm’s offences are said to include expressing pseudo-sincere concern for repressed bloggers in countries he couldn’t even locate on a Lonely Planet ‘Places I Pretend I’d love to Visit One Day’ app, posting iPhone photos of ‘well, anything’, and taking football news from BBC Sport much too seriously. But most of Crowe’s venom is reserved for the updates that express Simm’s love and admiration for his wife. ‘Yes they may well have gone to the Fat Duck, but he neglected to mention they only went to try and patch things up after she shagged the barman at her local karaoke. He didn’t mention he hasn’t been able to get it up for two years either, which might explain a few things and all.’ But Crowe is not restricting her bile to people on Facebook she knows well, identifying a much wider circle of Facebook friends who cause her pelvic floor to tighten in fury and disgust. ‘Vague acquaintances who think they’re an intellectual match for Stephen Fucking Fry because they know some basic grammar and can spot when some other halfwit has used it incorrectly, they can fuck right off. Oh and Stephen Fucking Fry too, but that’s more of a Twitter loathing, and I don’t really want to get distracted from the cockwittery of Facebook users. And their pets. Their stupid, stupid, stupid pets.’ When suggested to Crowe that much of the rage in her life could be alleviated by simply not using the social network, the healthcare worker sighed and admitted that she’s not sure there’s an aspect of her personality left that isn’t fed by the hatred of others on the internet. ‘Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the idea that one day I’ll see that fanny-dribble Simms’ profile frozen as an In Memoriam page,’ she confessed, ‘Stephanie will really fucking like that.’ Dr Turmoil"
CATHOLICISM FALLS IN TO ADMINISTRATION,3196,"The Catholic Church, the world’s largest supplier of Christianity, is set to file for administration as the Coronavirus shutdown pushes mainstream religions to breaking point.  Earlier this month The Holy See issued a profits warning following a disappointing Easter, traditionally one of the Church’s most profitable times of year.  Poor ticket sales and lower than expected TV revenue from the event had prompted CEO, The Pope, to seek a buyer for Catholicism. However, it is believed that talks regarding a potential purchase by Disney broke down last night, when agreement over Disney’s plans, to update the Sistine Chapel ceiling with characters from Frozen could not be reached. A last-ditch attempt to agree a deal with Buddhism also looks set to fail, as Buddhist boss, the Dalai Lama, has stated on numerous occasions that his organisation has, “absolutely no interest in material possessions.” The lack of a significant online presence, a failure to produce any pandemic preventing miracles, falling revenue from tourism and collection plates – allied to stiff competition from other magicians, such as Dynamo and David Blaine – have all been cited as contributing factors to the Catholic Church’s current financial difficulties. Despite some early success in the treatment of leprosy, blindness and paralysis, over more recent years the Church has largely moved out of the lucrative Healthcare sector, choosing instead to concentrate on the Real Estate and Entertainment markets. An ill-fated foray in to Child Care also proved to be a costly enterprise, resulting in significant damage to Catholicism’s brand image as well as its bottom line. Faith Analyst, Professor Richard Dawkins, doubted other ailing world religions would get a boost:  ‘It’s not a case of congregations simply switching supplier.  For a start there are compliance issues to overcome, as many competing religions do not fall under the same monotheistic One True God regulatory body.’ ‘Of those that are regulated by God, Islam and Judaism are both in the midst of board level wrangles over longer term strategy, and furthermore, their combined stance on Bacon is unlikely to attract any of the Catholic Church’s existing customers,’  said Prof. Dawkins. These customers – or Roman Catholics, as they prefer to be known – number approximately 1.3 billion worldwide.  The sheer volume of believers now seeking alternative dogma also renders a switch to more similar churches untenable.   Sadly, the Church of England (C of E) – formed after a hostile takeover of the Catholic Church’s UK branch by the Henry VIII group – have neither the resource or capacity to cope with such numbers. ‘We’ve focused our business on providing a Managed Service for events like Christenings, Weddings and Funerals, so we’re not so much a bums on pews type organisation anymore.  We simply don’t have anywhere to put everyone really,’ said C of E Head of Operations, The Archbishop of Canterbury.  ‘It’s a tough time for everyone in the industry at the moment.  We may well have a wealthy backer in the form of The Queen, but we’re really only managing to keep our head above water because of a recent increase in funeral bookings.’"
RACE TO DEVELOP VACCINE BEFORE KEY WORKERS CAN NEGOTIATE PAY RISE,1192,"Around the world, governments are funding a desperate race to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, before they are forced to concede higher wages and better working conditions for the millions of key workers that everyone now suddenly realises society depends on. “To combat the virus, we are looking to learn the lessons from our wartime efforts” said UK government spokesperson Ruth Jones. “So we get 110% behind our brave boys – and girls! – on the frontline, whether they be soldiers on the beaches or nurses on the wards. We make promises and say how we are all in their debt.” “And then when it’s all over – we get back to normal. Meaning we forget all about them and they are in debt– to mortgage lenders, payday lenders, and so forth.” “After all, the army can recruit private soldiers to go off and get bombs dropped on them for just £20k p.a., which makes £19k for healthcare assistants or £18k for food delivery drivers seem positively generous.” When asked about the value for money of MPs’ starting salary of £79k, or senior civil servants, she said that “now is the time to come together as a society, and anyway, what about Richard Branson eh? He’s even worse than us!”"
ALL HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE ISSUED WITH FOUR PIECES OF LAVVY PAPER PER DAY,1383,"‘This special measure is designed to reassure the great British public and to allay understandable concerns,’ said Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ‘From today, there is absolutely no need for panic buying.’ In a rare public appearance, Mr Johnson added: ‘From personal experience, I know what it’s like to be caught with your trousers down and nothing to cover your arse and so, in close consultation with, and full agreement from my Conservative cabinet colleagues, I’ve instigated and approved this important government initiative.’ Timothy White, Mr Johnson’s special advisor for arse-wiping, gave his personal assurance that the government has no shortage of paper. ‘In any event, you can always tear your Daily Mail into handy-sized pieces and hang them on a piece of string in the khazi,’ he said in an exclusive interview with the NewsBiscuit health correspondent. ‘That’s what my mum did during WWII.’ The new ration coupons will be sent to all households registered on every electoral roll in England and Wales, and are expected to be ready at the same time as the new blue passports. Individuals with diarrhoea will be able to apply for additional coupons, upon referral from a healthcare professional.  In the event of diarrhoea, you are advised to sit on a large bucket and dial 111. The scheme will be extended to Scotland, just as soon as Nicola Sturgeon gets the squits."
BRITAIN BRACES ITSELF FOR POST-BREXIT WAVE OF SCROUNGING EX-PATS,2056,"Fears are growing that Britain may be swamped by a ‘grey wave’ of elderly migrants returning once European healthcare accords are abolished when Britain leaves the EU. About 75% of Britons settled in continental Europe are one untimely slip in the shower away from the Grim Reaper – now multitudes of them may descend on us like a plague of wrinkly locusts, putting the nation’s supply of Werther’s Originals seriously to the test. ‘Brexit has put a lot of countries’ backs up’ said Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England. ‘We doubt they’ll continue footing the bill for our sickly retirees filling GPs’ surgeries every day, waiting to been seen for imaginary stabbing pains in their lower left back once formal welfare agreements end. If they return, they would overwhelm our already overstretched services – there are simply not enough Mecca Bingos to cope.’ UK residents have reported mixed feelings over the impending deluge of geriatric moochers. Some are furious over what they see as a betrayal of their own basic human right to live in Spain and refuse to learn the local language, while others have expressed concern that the OAPs will come over here and steal all the jobs working part-time Wednesday mornings in the Cancer Research UK shop. ‘I heard they don’t stand for the Queen’s speech anymore’, fumed housewife Nora Taylor. ‘But they’ll salute a photo of Antonio Banderas downing a Sangria and poking a bull in the eye with a sombrero. Disgraceful.’ However, Kevin Briggs said: ‘I don’t understand what’s going on here. Don’t we own the Costa del Sol? Isn’t that what the Falklands War was all about?’ The government has stressed that it intends to ensure that elderly Brits remain someone else’s problem. Said a Home Office spokesman: ‘We are determined that the generation that brought us rent-to-buy housing and the jerry curl, the 7th or 8th greatest generation of all time, will not become orphans of political upheaval.’ Meanwhile, the Isle of Wight County Council said that it really didn’t see what the problem was anyway.

‘A CATALOGUE OF ERRORS’ GETS PUBLICATION DATE,866,"A ‘Catalogue of Errors’, described as the first-ever attempt to showcase series of catastrophic failings in areas such as healthcare, the prison service, crowd control, defence and industry, will be published on 15 March, ‘barring accidents’, it was announced today. Publishers boast the lavishly illustrated 96-page catalogue will feature a portfolio of tragedies with ‘an error on every page’. ‘We wanted to be ready in time for the lucrative Christmas market,’ said HarperCollins spokeswoman Jessica Mortimer-Sykkes, but the photographer made a mistake with the proofs, the printers messed up the pagination and then thousands of copies were accidentally destroyed in a warehouse fire. It really was a…a sequence of inopportune events.’ If sales meet their targets, other publications under consideration include a Brochure of Confusion and a Pamphlet of Despair."
GREAT ORMOND STREET DRIVE-THROUGH HOSPITAL AND BOWLING ALLEY PLANS UNTRUE SAYS BORIS,1817,"Answering Labour’s accusations that the Tories plan to sell off the NHS, Boris Johnson today insisted that the decision to rename London Hospitals after American presidents and baseball stars, was pure coincidence. However, faced with a 451 page document, which Labour alleges gives chapter and verse on the Tories underhand, immoral and sneaky plans to sell the NHS to the highest bidder, Johnson cut a lonely figure standing on the steps of Downing Street whilst Cummings, Gove, Patel and Raab slithered out the back door. Red faced and sweating profusely the PM insisted he had fully intended to tell the country about the great sell off, but that he wanted it to be surprise for after the election, his Christmas present to his people. ‘It will be marvellous, first class, top rate, spiffing’, said Johnson. ‘Our United Kingdom will become the first country in Europe to fully embrace the freedom of an American style healthcare system.’ ‘The people of Britain will receive the finest medical care that an insurance policy can buy’, insisted the PM. ‘Just like the seats in a first class carriage on the railways, there will be lots of vacant beds in the new style hospitals, no undesirables clogging up the system, it will be top notch.’ Johnson confessed that plans were indeed in place to build new super mortuaries and multi storey crematoriums sponsored by Walmart and Budweiser, but these were only a precaution and should only be in constant use for the first few years whilst the new system beds in. ‘Mark my words, mark my words’, insisted Johnson, warming to his task and shaking his pudgy fist. ‘After we rid ourselves of this cursed, out of date Marxist ridden health service, we will slash the highest rate of Income tax to the bone and Corporation tax and inheritance tax will be abolished at last.’"
WOMAN ON BENEFITS WELCOMES BORIS CASH GIVEAWAY,1726,"Boris Johnson’s claim today that a new Tory Governments first act would be to slash National insurance contributions for all tax payers, was greeted with unbridled joy today as basic rate tax payers realised that this would mean at least an extra £1.63 per week in their pay packet. Janice Long,a mother of three from Halifax, was fighting back the tears as she explained the huge difference this would mean to herself, her family and their dog Dominic. Speaking to BBC North, Janice explained ‘our Jack worked it out and that’s practically £7.08 per month. ‘We are all so excited, the kids were shouting, “what you going to spend it on Mum? Can we go to Disney Land? Can we buy a car? Can we put it in the meter and have the fire on for half an hour?” ‘We are just not used to having such a massive sum in one big chunk, it’s like free money.’ said Janice. The Prime Minister later explained that this was ‘just the start of lower national Insurance contributions which we intend to reduce for everybody year on year, as we gradually sell off the NHS. ‘We believe that voters now understand that it is only the Conservative party that will allow all wage earners. and in particular the higher earners. to keep more of what they earn whilst we provide little or no public services. ‘It is only the Conservatives that will allow the public to decide what to spend their hard earned cash on, be it a holiday in the Maldives, BUPA Health Insurance or the bus fare to the food bank.’ He also confirmed that there would be no increase in taxation on private healthcare provided to the few, not the many, by employers and that this will still be allowable against Corporation tax.  Janice said she was ‘wetting herself’ with glee.  "
"US OPIOD CRISIS TO FUND THE NHS – REBRANDED JOHNSON, JOHNSON & JOHNSON",2142,"Opiod abuse is the key to a balanced post Brexit healthcare system in the UK, Donald Trump has told Boris Johnson in the wake of the Johnson and Johnson judgement.  In a personal letter leaked to the British Medical Journal President Trump says:  ‘What’s really tragic is that you Brits pioneered this method of treatment but you’ve failed to build on your past successes.  We were agog with admiration when you wiped out around 650 patients at Gosport War Memorial Hospital all those years ago but what have you done since?  OK it solved a local problem of bed blocking and waiting lists but it’s hardly revolutionised the NHS has it?’ ‘My own view,’ the president goes on.  ‘Is that you’ve been hamstrung by all those EU regulations and that health and safety crap.  As soon as November comes you want to drop all that stuff and get back on stream.  You see what we’ve managed in little old Oklahoma – 6000 deaths and that was without any government interference.  With your more centralised system the sky will be the limit.  I will personally direct the bosses of J&J to cut you a very advantageous deal provided you can let them have a few hospitals to play with.’ A spokesman for Number 10 said Boris Johnson was delighted with the President’s letter and the implied support in it: ‘As a British Prime Minister he will do practically anything to accommodate the President’s wishes however absurd.  But there are one or two things that need to be sorted out.  For example Mr Johnson has seen Oklahoma several times and he thinks it’s a jolly fine musical but at no point were there 6000 members of the cast.  Also with our smaller population we can’t afford to slaughter too many people as the next time we have a referendum it could lead to a tie rather than a majority one way or the other.’
Westminster insiders say that a number of Cabinet members have already suggested to the Prime Minister that in order to speed up a post Brexit trade deal with the Americans he should try and lay hands on some J&J samples as soon as possible so that they can make an early appraisal of their efficacy.  Michael Gove was unavailable for comment."
HOW TO SURVIVE PROROGATION,1204,"Plan ahead – Brexit is coming.   In the event of a sudden closure of Parliament, paint yourself white to minimise its effects. Stock up on a selection of fine continental cheeses and horde them in your basement. Stock up on brochures and book your next holiday in England before the Brexit rush. Even parts of Wales are quite reasonable for tourists. Scotland is not advised. If you run a public services consultancy company, particularly in the field of healthcare, call the government immediately and have your bank account details ready.  If you cannot contact the British government, the American government will do. Check your credit score hourly. Ensure you have a funeral plan in place. With Government likely to use No deal Brexit as a further excuse for more Austerity, if you are on benefits, kiss your arse goodbye. If you have an ongoing medical condition, see 2 above. Make sure you know the location of your nearest food bank. Take daily sips of Domestos to acclimatise your palate to your new ‘American’ diet. Leave voter? Get ready to celebrate the arrival of 2m plus immigrants from all corners of the globe (Except EU). Check your credit score half hourly. (hattip Sir Lupus & TonyMc81)"
PENSIONER ACCIDENTALLY VOTED IN AS PM,623,"Following an unfortunate typo in the voting papers, Doris Johnson, 87, a pensioner from Hove has been elected as Prime Minister.
Mrs Johnson was surprised at the news but, once matron had explained it, set about forming her manifesto with an enthusiasm not seen since her late husband’s funeral.
Over a nice cup of tea, Doris outlined her policies. “Well I’ll increase pensions and restore the free TV licence of course” said Doris, “Then I suppose I should do something about the environment for all those nice young people and put a lot more money into healthcare… Oh, and send all the darkies back where they came from.”"
ZUCKERBERG LAUNCHES “FACEBLOOD” ‘PURELY TO HELP HAEMOPHILIACS’,1011,"Mark Zuckerberg has insisted that Facebook’s new blood transfusion service is a charitable venture aimed at the world’s haemophiliacs, and not at all an attempt to monopolise supply of what is literally the lifeblood of the world. The popular burgundy plasma flows in the bodies of an estimated 7.5bn people, who depend on it for their everyday survival. ‘The poor of the world lack access to clean blood for medical procedures. This is a life-threatening crisis that we can solve,’ said Mr Zuckerberg. “So all we are asking is for everyone else in the world to sign the rights to their blood over to Facebook.’ ‘Obviously, there is no way we would ever start charging you to get your own blood back, sell your blood group data to private healthcare and insurance companies for, like, literally hundreds of billions of dollars…, or siphon it off for our Board of Directors to drink in the hours of darkness (Pacific Time). We promise.’ ‘You can trust us now, really,’ he added. ‘We’ve put Nick Clegg in charge.’"
NHS JEALOUS OF NORTH KOREA,909,"In an impassioned speech from the pokey confines of a nursing home, the ailing NHS hit out about her shocking treatment and labelled her 70th birthday celebrations as ‘a kick in the teeth’.   ‘For 70 years I’ve been delivering a free point of care health service to millions of people and what do I get in return?’ lamented the decrepit health system.   ‘A mention on the BBC and a few stale cakes made in a bake off.’ ‘It’s all take, take, take these days.  They roll up here, most of them obese and smoking like chimneys, and expect me to give them the latest in modern healthcare free of charge, and then two weeks later they’re in A&E with a headache!  Did you hear what they laid on for North Korea when it was her 70th?  She had street parades, ticker tape, banners.  A proper do, it was’. Sources said the NHS shuffled off to bed shortly after the interview, muttering: ‘They’ll miss me when I’m gone.’"
POLICE TO INTRODUCE CONTROVERSIAL ‘STOP AND DEPORT’,1440,"In an effort to curb black British citizens committing paperwork crime, police have been given controversial ‘stop and deport’ powers to use on anyone that looks like they’re not directly descended from King Arthur. ‘We’re not targeting any one community in particular.’ said one police boss, ‘Well apart from the black one of course. If we suspect someone is walking our streets without their passport, birth certificate and thirty years of detailed tax records, then they will be stopped. Unless they’re white, and then they won’t be stopped. Well, they could be….’ he warned, ‘but they won’t be,’ he reassured. ‘We don’t want to alarm certain communities, but this lack of paperwork has got to stop. We can’t have feral packs of law-abiding, hard-working adults roaming the streets, trying to get healthcare and such things without giving the Home Office 400 pages of paperwork and 1500 quid,’ said the Chief Constable. Amber Rudd said that only Britons that her department decided were actually Britons would be allowed to stay in Britain. ‘Basically anyone that doesn’t regularly wear Union Jack undies, doesn’t love massive queues, and can’t recite at least 20 lines of dialogue from ‘Zulu’ is in big danger.’ As well as the Windrush Britons, all people of foreign background are now under suspicion, with a Home Office van seen leading an elderly couple away from a central London palace for questioning about their right to be here."
DISAFFECTED UK EXTREMISTS ‘MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO RE-JOIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY’,2359,"The Prime Minister today announced a new raft of measures designed to combat the threat of Britons joining the shadowy extremist group UKIP, including removing the right of those individuals to later return to the Conservative Party. While support for UKIP continues to grow, many of those who joined are now looking for a way back, having become disillusioned with life in the organisation. Douglas Barswell (not his real name) is one such individual. Douglas joined UKIP a few months ago, after being radicalised by the online sermons of their enigmatic leader Nige Al-Farage, but now wants to leave. ‘When you first get in contact they make it sound like a great life,’ he explained. ‘They’ll say, “Sure, you can go and have five pints in your lunch hour and still drive back to the office” or “Yeah, we’ll give you your own saucy 70’s sitcom secretary who considers a playful slap on the arse or a quick breast rummage to be the most empowering compliment any man could pay her”, but when you get there it’s a different story.’ ‘Instead, I get up really early and spend all morning misinterpreting some statistics. Then at lunchtime I have to give Nige his daily oiling, while the rest of the day is spent denouncing his views on privatised healthcare, arguing that Mark Feckless (not his real name) doesn’t always mean what he says or trying to persuade Mike Read not to record any more bizarre racist singles.’ John Chapman, an outreach worker who specialises in combatting extremism at grass roots level explained, ‘Douglas is a classic example of the sort of disaffected 48 year old white male that, faced with losing both his majority and his hair, and equipped with a misplaced nostalgia for a time when a Polish Shop was somewhere that you’d go to buy turtle wax, becomes an easy target for the extremists. My job is to stop that happening in the first place.’ ‘But society needs to do its bit as well and understand that deep down they are just ordinary people trying to make sense of life. In fact, if you take away their six bedroom Georgian townhouses, holiday cottages in Cornwall, well stocked wine cellars, regular skiing holidays, generous expense accounts, lucrative company directorships, brand new X-Type Jaguars and all-expense paid business class ‘fact finding’ missions to the Seychelles then you’ll find they’re just like you and I.’"
JEREMY HUNT TO OPEN WORLD’S FIRST PLACEBO HOSPITAL,2231,"Britain’s first hospital built entirely on the power of suggestion is to be opened next week as a cost-effective solution to the rising price of healthcare. The Royal London Placebo is totally fabricated, offers no actual treatments and will be manned entirely by extras from TV shows such as Casualty and Holby City. ‘Each doctor will have a nice white coat, a plastic stethoscope and a range of brightly coloured sugar pills,’ explained Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ‘No expense has been spared,’ he said, ‘except the expense of building an actual hospital with trained staff and equipment.’ The Royal Placebo is understood to be the first in a new generation of ‘dummy hospitals’ to be rolled out across the country, allowing the phasing out of the costly old style ‘real’ hospitals of the past. ‘The placebo effect can account for up to 75% of the effectiveness of a medical treatment,’ explained Hunt. ‘Rather than waste billions on the current system we can achieve almost the same results for a fraction of the cost.’ Pilot studies show that half the patients who attended a placebo hospital imagined they were better and went home; meanwhile the other half had a failure of imagination and died on the spot. ‘Either way it’s a win-win,’ said Hunt. The Health Secretary is a well-known supporter of alternative treatments and is believed to be using the theory of homeopathy to help design a massively watered down health service that operates purely on the memory of the NHS. However, some placebo doctors are already complaining after being told that they will also be expected to run their own imaginary budgets. ‘I can’t pretend to run a pretend budget as well as pretend to be a doctor,’ said one stressed thesp. ‘I’m an actor playing a doctor, not an actor playing a doctor playing at being an accountant.’ Mr Hunt rejected claims that the new dummy hospitals represent the effective dismantling of the National Health Service. ‘The important thing to remember is that the placebo remains free at the point of delivery,’ he said. ‘The NHS will still exist as an idea, and sometimes that’s all that people really need. ‘Placebos are the future,’ he insisted, ‘although for many that may be a difficult pill to swallow.’"
TORIES TO PUT THE ‘C’ BACK INTO ‘DAS KAPITAL’,1766,"Comrade May has pledged to: ‘secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry upon the basis of common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange’, plus a small condo in Novosibirsk. Addressing a crowd of carefully selected miners outside a colliery-turned-arts centre, Theresa May declared: ‘Apart from free healthcare, education, pensions, minimum wages, job security and a sense of purpose, Labour governments have given you nothing! My International Conservatives are going to give you what you deserve. Capitalists of the world, unite!’ Hailing hard Brexit as a ‘once-in-a-new-epoch chance to trade with comrades across the globe, not just in Europe’, Mrs May set out her dream in which every Butlins was like Davos, and every social tower block as blinging as Trump Tower. “’We’re going to extend free health care to wild animals,’ she declared. ‘Soon, foxes will go to the vets without fear.  Like Boxer in Animal Farm!’ Jeremy Corbyn appeared sceptical:  ‘This is clearly a cynical device to win over support from ordinary people, which, if it succeeds, will have my full backing,’ he stated.   ‘I’ve instructed my agents to pull any candidates standing against pink Tories – we wouldn’t want to hurt their chances.’ Trade union bosses questioned whether a Prime Minister who could call a snap election after denying she would do so could be trusted to keep her word, and also wondered how she planned to pay for her redistributive plans. ‘Let me be quite clear – everything is fully costed and I never change my mind,’ said Mrs May.  ‘All benefits are fully funded by a penny tax on a litre of air.  And our detailed proposals clarify that by ownership, I mean share options.  And by workers, I mean bosses.’"
"WELL DUH, BBC TELLS VIEWERS CONNED BY SHOW ABOUT CONMEN",1882,"The BBC today responded to allegations that The Real Hustle a show about conmen had attempted to fool viewers by using actors instead of members of the public. ‘The show intends to show the public how frauds work. Well, this is how frauds work,’ said Dawn Garnet, BBC3 Head of Light Froth, before adding with an eye roll, ‘Sheesh’. Outcry over the allegations has led to twos of people jamming the BBC Switchboard demanding to know if other BBC shows are faking it, such as whether Patsy Kensit is indeed a fully qualified healthcare professional. Brian Porteous, a credulous lunk from Romford, told the Mail on Sunday: ‘BBC lies… make brain hurt.’ ‘The Real Hustle might be real although viewers think it’s fake, and Hustle is fake despite people thinking it might be real,’ explained Garnet. ‘The problem is that Hustle is so convincing, people actually think Robert Vaughan is in it, when in fact he’s simply a hand inside a brown paper bag with a face and eyes drawn on it.’ Baz Dalyrymple, TV correspondent at the Mail on Sunday, which broke the story, said: ‘When BBC 3 viewers squat down to watch these kind of shows, they like to fantasise that they themselves could successfully ‘hustle’ a ‘mark’ simply by using a jacket with pockets, hand-drawn £20 notes and a fake office block complete with dummy cash machine. ‘If it turns out this is all just a lark with actors instead of real chumps then there is every chance that when viewers attempt to emulate these scams they will be banged up in the clink, and have their dirtbox ravaged by a large chap called Darren.’ The success of both Hustle and The Real Hustle has led to BBC bosses to plan further spin-offs including The Unreal Hustle in which the conmen are ghosts (although probably they’re not) and The Surreal Hustle in which a large ham sandwich attempts to convince members of the public it’s coronation chicken."
JK ROWLING UNVEILS 2017 REWRITES OF HARRY POTTER SERIES,963,"J.K. Rowling has announced she is going to completely re-write all seven Harry Potter novels and this time, Voldemort will triumph. In a recent tweet, the author said that ‘the world has clearly turned upside down’ and now ‘evil is more commercially viable than good’. Rowling has made no secret of her desire to introduce a new generation to the joys of queuing outside WHSmith at midnight ready to hand over £21.99 on a regular basis, and a more contemporary feel to the books will help her achieve that. The revised Harry Potter series will feature new titles, including Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Guantanamo, Harry Potter and the  Executive Order of the Phoenix, and Harry Potter and the Half Blood Mexican Immigrant. The series will end with Voldemort killing Harry Potter and taking over the free world. His first acts will include making torture legal, banning affordable healthcare and blocking anyone who disagrees with him on Twitter. Marie Maurer"
TRUMP DECLARES OBAMA PRESIDENCY WAS JUST FAKE NEWS,1049,"Barack Obama’s eight year Presidency and all of his reforms and legislation were “fake news created by the liberal media elite,” President Donald Trump has said. He declared that he does not need to repeal and replace Obamacare as it never actually existed. Anybody using the system to access affordable healthcare is therefore a criminal and could expect the “FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAW” to be used against them, President Trump later tweeted. Nor was there any environmental legislation brought in over the past eight years, according to the new President. He urged business that had believed the “media lies” to employ US workers to burn “oil, gas, so-called endangered animals, any old crap” to compensate for their unnecessarily reduced environmental damage. “Didn’t happen, period,” he said. “Barack Obama did not hold the presidency nor did he sign any agreements or laws. These are lies portrayed by the CROOKED media – that is fact. Well, an alt-fact anyway, which is great. Truly great – it’ll save me a hell of a lot of work.”   StanleyMizaru"
HAMMOND’S AUTUMN STATEMENT MAKES BOOKER FICTION LIST,1273,"The Chancellor is on course to win the nation’s top literary prize for a ‘completely fabricated’ depiction of the British economy. With his mythical world of unicorns and balanced budgets, Mr. Hammond’s accounting has all the hallmarks of a contemporary fairy story, with more than a hint of ‘Grimm’ about it. Critics have applauded his allegorical references to ‘The End of Days’ or Brexit as it is known. One English teacher explained: ‘Boosting workers’ income and housebuilding, are clearly a dream sequence and not intended to be taken literally. It’s magical realism. Creative accounting. Or as Hemmingway would have described it – a ‘crock of shit’.’ Hammond’s fantasy has elements of other great works – ‘Lord of the Flies’, ‘Catch 22’ and ‘The Hunger Games’ – while keeping the same dreary narrative of every other Tory Government. Said one fan: ‘It reminds me of The Borrowers – if all their borrowing was from Wonga’. Not only has he redefined fiction, Hammond has changed the value of numbers. Should he win the £50,000 Man Booker Prize, Mr. Hammond has said he will not let the money change him; he promised he will still be a ‘d@ck’. Future works of fiction are planned; like ‘Universal Healthcare’, ‘Free schooling’ and the abstract concept of human empathy."
"MAD HATTER, DORMOUSE ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN TEA PARTY LANDSLIDE",1876,"Voters in Wonderland have elected a series of right-wing Tea Party candidates, including the Mad Hatter, the March hare and the dormouse, to Congress in the country’s mid-term elections. The result was a disaster for the ruling Democrats.   ‘I understand that people are frustrated with our lack of progress on some issues,’ the President admitted. Polls have shown that there is growing anger at rising crime rates, with tart theft at an all-time high, and that a majority of voters no longer believe that the Jabberwock can be slain, but that Wonderland troops should whiffle home as soon as possible. The President telephoned the new Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Mad Hatter – a Tea Party grandee – to offer his congratulations and to find out what the difference is between a raven and a writing-desk. The Tea Party, a right-wing movement within the mainsteam Republican group, put in a strong showing. Although she was not standing for election, the movement’s leader, the Red Queen, had spent the campaign storming up and down the country yelling ‘Off with his head!’ and ‘Lobster quadrille, baby, quadrille’, which seems to have paid off. The results put the Red Queen in a strong position to run for the presidency in 2012, a contest which will begin later this year with the Republican Caucus-Race. She denied that her support base was composed mainly of dodos and White Rabbit supremacists. One voter, the Mock Turtle, explained why he had defected to the Tea Party. ‘A while back I was totally persuaded by the cool, purring Illinois Cat,’ he said. ‘I really thought he could make a difference. But over time, he’s just sort of vanished and left nothing behind him but a reformed healthcare system, a fledgling economic recovery, and a broad grin that just hangs there in midair. It’s big government gone mad. God bless Wonderland!’ 3rd November 2010"
US REPUBLICANS DISBAND AFTER VOTERS STILL DON’T GET THE JOKE,2323,"Republican party chiefs in the US have announced that the party is to break up and will no longer contest elections. The decision was attributed to widespread disillusionment among party activists who have decided that it’s no fun adopting policies and candidates that could only be part of an elaborate practical joke, if the entire electorate is just too thick to notice. ‘It’s not like we were subtle about it,’ said senior Republican John Boehner, ‘We thought in a country like this we had no chance against an ordained minister like Jimmy Carter in 1980, so just for kicks we set up Ronald Reagan, a twice-divorced Hollywood actor with the brains of a radiator as the Christian candidate against him. And he won. Twice. Holy fucking crap, how did we get away with it?’ Following mixed success with relatively colourless candidates in the 1990s, Republican chiefs went all-out for laughs by putting forward George W. Bush, an educationally sub-normal alcoholic draft dodger, as the candidate for pro-military born again evangelicals. ‘We were laughing our asses off on election night in 2000,’ said Boehner. ‘When he won by a blatant fraud in the state run by his brother and senior officials said he hadn’t been elected president but appointed by God, I thought, OK, they’re bound to get it now. But nope, he did it again four years on. George W. Bush. George W. Freekin’ Bush! What is WRONG with you people?’ However, in view of the recent mid-term elections, where massive gains were recorded by the Tea Party movement backed by Sarah Palin, a known ‘Big Oil’ supporter who backs creationist education — ‘I mean, hello! Fossil fuels? The clue’s right there in the goddamn name!’ — Boehner has conceded that the joke has turned sour. ‘The Founding Fathers warned about the perils of democracy and now we can see why,’ he told reporters. ‘Americans are just too dumb to be trusted with dangerous pointy instruments like pencils every other year. We’re outta here and I don’t care if that does mean six more years of Obama. And besides, with Wall Street bailouts proceeding as planned, ongoing war in Afghanistan and decent healthcare still the privilege of the wealthy with the Democrats all the while claiming to be the party of change, it’s not like there isn’t going to be somebody out there still taking the piss.’"
FAT PEOPLE ‘NOT THAT FUNNY’ SAYS OBESITY EXPERT,1521,"Overweight celebrities such as Gavin and Stacey star James Corden are perpetuating the stereotype that all fat people are funny, a medical expert is warning. Professor Nicholas McKay of Nuffield Health says fat stars are seen as role models, helping to make it acceptable to think that obesity is linked to humour. But a survey for the healthcare provider has now revealed that many obese people are not actually that funny. Researchers found many obese people refused to use a proper punch line when telling jokes and almost one in five did not appreciate the importance of timing when telling a joke. The survey of over 2,000 individuals, some of whom were very, very fat indeed, also revealed many obese people fail to recognise that they have a humour problem at all. Professor McKay, an expert on obesity comedy said: ‘The increasing profile of larger celebrities, for example James Corden, Eamonn Holmes, Ruth Jones and Beth Ditto, means that fat people increasingly think that they are funny as well, even if they are just slightly overweight and actually quite boring.’ Although he does not think large celebrities have been in any sense responsible for perpetuating the stereotype that exists today, he says the increased numbers of fat people who think they are funny is alarming. ‘If fat people continue to turn a blind eye to their complete inability to tell a joke, they will see their life expectancy considerably shortened,’ he warned. ‘Probably by someone sitting in the audience.’ he added. 1st July 2009"
"£3,000 ‘BIRTH BUDGETS’ COULD FUND SPA WEEKEND",1441,"The NHS in England may soon regret allowing pregnant women to allocate their own healthcare allowance; with many predicting a rise in subsidised trips to Selfridges. Indeed, some women have already opted to economise on maternity facilities by birthing in a skip and using the remaining cash to fund ‘one incredible night in Las Vegas’. This notional budget was only meant for NHS-accredited services, but many have seen it as carte-blanche to redecorate,‘get the loft extension fixed or go to town on lottery tickets. Quite whether Health officials anticipated the money being squandered on nine months of booze and fags is unclear. However, most admit it would undiplomatic at this time to mention elective surgery. Male partners have suggested that such a scheme is wasteful and that the priority should be the health of the child and ‘buying a new Xbox’. Although not all mothers-to-be have been so cynical, one explained: ‘I’ve invested £2,900 on an epidural filled with crystal meth. And if that doesn’t numb the pain, I’ve spent the last hundred quid on a large polo mallet’. The issue of pain relief is an interesting one, as female acupuncture only costs a few hundred pounds, but for £3,000 you could have the satisfaction of seeing a bowling ball rammed inside a man’s anus. One woman admitted: ‘It’s a tough decision. Do I use the modest sum of money to create the perfect birthing environment or do I pay off Google’s tax bill?’"
HILLARY CLINTON STILL FAVOURITE TO PRESENT QI,1919,"US presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton remains the overwhelming favourite to win the race to succeed Stephen Fry as presenter of QI, after a sometimes stormy election debate in Chicago last night. Mrs Clinton appeared on stage alongside her rivals, socialist Bernie Sanders, former Idaho governor Lincoln Chafee, Jack Dee, David Mitchell and Nicholas Parsons. None of the candidates was seen as defeating Mrs Clinton although Mr Sanders delivered some memorable lines and Nicholas Parsons surprised viewers with his principled opposition to air strikes in Syria. The race is entering its final months and the candidates have begun to distance themselves from the outgoing incumbent, Stephen Fry, whose term comes to an end when he finally reaches series M in 2016. After some initial successes – particularly in the areas of foreign policy, healthcare and interesting facts about how languages develop and the occurence of colourblindness among giraffes – his time in office has begun to run out of steam with increasingly trenchant opposition from hard-line Republicans, the pro-gun lobby, and idiot stalwart Alan Davies.’I just sit here and say really dumb things based on my half-remembered schooling and everybody finds it absolutely hilarious,’ said Donald Trump. Mrs Clinton has been campaigning hard for almost sixteen months since the official launch of her campaign, although her ambition to sit in the big chair and have all the answers dates back far longer. ‘This is a role I’ve been preparing for my whole life,’ she told an audience of almost 12 million US viewers. ‘As First Lady I spent hours memorising the foibles of sixteenth-century Cambodian monarchs and the anatomical curiosities of various species of pangolin. And I don’t think anybody can deny that I’ve done some incredibly interesting things when I was Secretary of State, as my emails show plainly  for all to see. Well, some of them.’"
SWARM OF BRITISH MIGRANTS ‘RUINING’ GREEK ISLAND,1913,"EU leaders have warned that a surging tide of migrants from Britain is threatening to overwhelm the Greek island of Kos. Fears are growing that the authorities in Kos could lose control of the situation, as ever more sunburnt families, students and stag dos migrate to the island in a desperate search to escape the threat of tedium and pissing rain in their homeland Local fisherman Stathis Dimitriou said that he feared his way of life could be under threat from the migrants. ‘This used to be a peaceful island where I could make a decent living from fishing, just like my father and grandfather used to. But since these migrants came over here, dumping beer cans in the sea and listening to shit dance music, there have been no fish to catch and I’m struggling to make ends meet,’ he said. The migrants reputedly pay a gang of cynical people-traffickers called EasyJet up to £32.99 to be brought to Kos, often in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. However, their numbers have surged to the extent that they could soon overrun local police and health services, paid for by hard-working Greek taxpayers. ‘They come over here just to claim free healthcare for when they need their stomachs pumped at 4 in the morning. All at the expense of Joseferos Mugginopoulos here,’ lamented taxi driver Stelios Gianakos. ‘I’d shoot the bastards, but it would probably go against petty EU law and their poxy ‘yuman rights’.’ The Greek government has been warned that the plague of migrants can’t go on for ever, as tensions between the British and the locals inevitably boil over into drunken fights outside nightclubs. Some, however, have expressed sympathy with the migrants’ motives. ‘These people are only trying to improve their lives by coming to Kos and we should respect that,’ said 16-year-old Abu al-Said, a refugee from Libya. ‘I did the same and my homeland doesn’t sound half as awful as theirs.’ Ivan_Edwards"
NHS TO BE REBRANDED AS ‘BRITAIN’S GOT ILLNESS’,1610,"Health Minister Andrew Lansley has confirmed that the latest NHS reforms will require patients seeking treatment to be seen by a panel of three healthcare professionals, ‘sitting behind a desk with their hands on a buzzer with a light-up x attached’. “Patients want choice, and also a second opinion’ said Mr Lansley. ‘This gives them both, provided that they accept our definition of ‘private consultation’ to include the viewing audience of ITV2.’ Under new guidelines each commissioning team will have at least one GP who takes pity on every patient, ‘especially if they’ve come on a long journey to get to the surgery’, one who buzzes all but the most obviously sick, and one who vacillates between the other two. A trial in Hull saw profits from selling TV rights  ploughed straight back into front line services, with the complete overhaul of at least two vending machines in A & E funded within days. Once each NHS trust has a studio surgery, stage two will see the National Centre for Clinical Excellence scrapped in favour of a premium rate phone line giving the public the chance to vote for who gets the most expensive treatments. ‘We’re really proud of that one’ continued Mr Lansley. ‘Self funding care provision based on democratic choice! In your face, Miliband.’ One early trialist of the new approach seemed impressed. ‘The docs listened to my symptoms, then kept asking if anyone else in my family had more interesting illnesses’ he said. ‘Luckily for me my nan had just died and I started crying – I got signed off work for two weeks, and a tissue from the cameraman. I bloody love the NHS.’"
"THE ECONOMY IS STUPID, AGREE POLITICAL LEADERS",2080,"Leaders from seven political parties last night agreed that the UK economy was stupid, but that it wasn’t its fault. All agreed that it hadn’t received adequate training, proper consideration of the environment in which it operated, appropriate healthcare or fairness to pull it up to an appropriate and sustainable level where it could begin to respect itself again, and as a result had got itself into a spot of bother. The economy is still lying on a trolley in a British hospital awaiting effective treatment, the leaders all accepted, but was now being asked to pay up front for any service provision which could make it better. Labour argued that there might be a credit card handy to influence the speed of treatment and the Greens agreed, while the Tories hinted that if the economy would simply agree to cut off an arm, the rest could be saved, possibly even within just a couple of years, waiting times permitting. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon hinted that the economy could do better if only it would move to Scotland, but forgot to mention that her prediction was based, like every other one she’s made, on oil still costing $120 a barrel and a massive subsidy from the rest of the UK. Plaid Cymru suggested they’d put in ‘what they could’ leading to rolling eyes and raised eyebrows among the other panel members, and UKIP’s leader, Nigel Fagash, promised to get the economy back on track by looking carefully at anyone who’d played a part in keeping it alive, picking a few random ones and ‘sending ‘em home’. The Lib Dems said something but nobody can remember what is was. With so much to think about and not much chance of recovery for a while, the economy has decided to take a bit of time out, go to an egalitarian commune where every economy matters, where nature is cherished, and where everyone is equal under the law. Brief, exciting dalliances with other economies which ultimately come to nothing haven’t been ruled out. On it’s return from its gap, or ‘deficit’ year, which it thinks is going to be ‘massive’, the economy will probably get a job in banking."
SHEPHERD’S BUSH TO RUN AS US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,964,"An area of West London may run as a Republican candidate for the US Presidency. A spokesperson for the wealthy borough of Hammersmith and Fulham confirmed ‘Shep’ Bush could be the third Bush to reside at the White House, despite a lengthy commute. New York Times Columnist Mike Smithers has already welcomed the news, saying Shepherd’s Bush couldn’t be much worse than George or George W. But Shepherd’s Bush’s views on Cuba, the economy, military policy in the Middle East and healthcare provision are not yet known. Yet many have found the Bush’s grasp on geopolitics ‘a whole lot better than Jeb’s.’ And many Republicans have already embraced the idea of ‘White City’. If successful, a number of West London boroughs could also throw their metaphorical hats into the ring. A new era of presidents could follow, seen by savvy commentators as an antidote to George W’ Bush’s axis of evil. One speechwriter has already coined the phrase a ‘Shepherd’s Bush Empire’."
PRIVATE SCHOOLS MUST BE MORE PATRONISING TO KEEP TAX RELIEF,2381,"Labour’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt has announced plans to make private schools’ tax breaks conditional on being a lot more patronising towards state schools.  ‘Some independent schools are already being extremely patronising and we welcome that, but if the sector as a whole is dodging tax to the tune of £165 million a year they must elucidate why they think they’re totally superior in every possible way.’ They must rack off more of the best state school teachers and put far more emphasis on subtly undermining public trust in tax-payer-funded schools. It’s no longer going to be enough to advertise your expensive facilities and small class sizes, you have to put the emphasis back where it belongs on the nebulous superiority of your teachers. They are probably at least 43.8% cleverer, stronger and better looking than their state school colleagues, are not required to have any pesky training or qualifications and could patronise the tits off ordinary teachers if we let them keep a tax incentive to do so. ” In the past, education ministers and spokespeople were happy to patronise state schools for the sheer love of it. Indeed many in the party saw it as an insult in 1986 when proposals were put forward to give MPs tax relief on bottled water used to moisten their throats during speeches that drew snide comparisons between state and private schools. More recently it has been felt that the level of condescension has dropped to unacceptable levels and that it is no longer sustainable to rely on wealthy benefactors providing this essential public service. Labour MPs (some from deprived backgrounds) who suffer from the handicap of vestigial consciences would certainly require financial support to undertake this onerous new responsibility. In a connected statement, Hunt suggested that in future private healthcare providers such as BUPA could register as charities as long as they give local GPs their old photocopiers and make more adverts hinting that your poor old granny might even die in an NHS hospital. The Chairman of the Independent Schools Association said in a statement, “We’ve not paid a penny in tax since before 1634, so why should we start now? If we allow the government of the day to start using taxation as tool of fiscal policy to influence stability, efficiency and redistribution then where will we all be eh? Eh? Boo-ya.” limpets"
AMATEUR BRUSHERS BANNED FROM USING ORAL B PRO-EXPERT TOOTHPASTE,2472,"People with amateur teeth have been banned from buying or using Oral B Pro-Expert toothpaste under new dental healthcare guidelines. Similarly, only those who use their teeth professionally and have a licence to prove it will be able to obtain Colgate sensitive Pro-relief over the counter. And ‘Pro’-rated toothbrushes, both electric and manual, will also now only be available to those who can smile suitably whitely at newly installed till-top electronic teeth recognition scanners. ‘Pro means professional,’ said Mick Smythe of the Professional Toothowners Federation, whose own teeth dabbled in the lower divisions for many years before finally turning pro in March 2003. ‘Expert means ‘knowing what you’re doing’, and to put these products into the hands of people without formal training in professional dentifrices might only lead to unforeseen consequences, unrequited love and, in many cases, shattered dreams.’ Amateur tooth-owner Jeremy Smythers agrees. He told a dental hygiene conference; ‘I for one wouldn’t know where to start with a tube of pro-toothpaste. Which end of the tube to squeeze, for example? What about lid control, which I understand takes two years of intensive study to fully master? And what does all that small print mean? Only people who have sat down and studied every aspect of dental science can truly understand the complex formulae of a properly pro-expert toothpaste. The consequences of inappropriate use? Well, it doesn’t bear thinking about.’ Jenny Schmidt took three years under close supervision before she could go solo with a Colgate Pro Clinica C200 electric toothbrush. ‘It carries responsibilities,’ she said, ‘The C200 is powerful and complicated beast, and yes I get a buzz out of using it, but it would all have been futile if it weren’t for the intensive training I had to be able to properly squirt a bit of paste on this amazing brush and whizz it round my gob. I didn’t have a clue what I was doing before, so thank goodness for all that pro-training from the Colgate people!’ Colgate and Oral-B, while dismissing accusations of elitism, have responded with the introduction of a new all-inclusive dental hygiene regime for the masses, branded as ‘au-Naturel’ which is essentially a twig packaged up beautifully in designer plastic with a sympathetically associated tub of bicarbonate of Soda, all priced at £19.99, available in all good stores and absolutely ideal for an amateur-toothed loved one this Christmas."
"‘LOOK, CAN WE ALL JUST FOCUS ON THE POVERTY?’ SAYS BRAZIL",1791,"Brazil has come out united in the fact that it’s the country’s disgraceful levels of poverty and inequality we should all really be focusing on. Home to around 23,000 street children, plus 23 other men who were once thought to be able to kick a ball quite well, the country had decided it was best to spend millions of dollars on some giant fun-bowls with gift-shops added on in the hope of a fiscal boost. ‘Perhaps the people in Favelas would have been happier in their lives, waving a big Brazil flag and talking endlessly of Neymar,’ said Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, ‘but they messed it up, and there go my chances of re-election.’ ‘It’s the worst day of my life.’ said Luiz Felipe Scolari, a 65-year-old man of no particular note or importance in the lives of the average Brazilian, upon hearing that approximately a quarter of his country’s urban population live in favelas, bereft of adequate healthcare and sanitation, and subject to one of the highest murder-rates anywhere in the world. ‘I mean, most of these people have as much to spend on food each week as it might cost to buy, say, a small plastic trumpet.’ he added. ‘But hang on. Groups of them. Four at the back, four at the front and maybe two up front all playing trumpets. Tactically, yes, that might have helped? Noted for 2018!’ ‘It’s just shocking. I’m devastated. We need to learn how to defend…’ said one young lady, tearfully cradling her head in her hands, too distraught to finish her sentence with the words ‘basic human rights’. ‘We’re well aware that roughly 1 in 5 people in Brazil currently live below the poverty line.’, said one clearly upset government official as he wept uncontrollably into a pile of Brazilian R$’s. ‘However,’ he continued, ‘we’re working hard to bring it down to… er, 1 in 7.’"
‘BIRTHERS’ CONFLICTED AFTER OBAMA’S BIRTH CERTIFICATE PROVES HE IS SON OF GOD,1916,"Republican conspiracy theorists have reported bewilderment today after their persistent claims for documentary evidence of the President’s place of birth were answered by a birth certificate confirming that Barack Obama was born neither in Hawaii or Kenya, but in a stable in Bethlehem. ‘This leaves us in a bit of a fix,’ admitted leading right-wing sceptic Donald Trump. ‘On the one hand we know once and for all that Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States and is ineligible for the presidency. But on the other he is the human incarnation of Almighty God, and that’s likely to play pretty well among our church-going grass-roots supporters. Even so, you show me where in the Bible it says that these healthcare reforms are the divine will of God.’ The copy of Obama’s ‘long form’ birth certificate provides conclusive proof that he was born in a manger in the Holy land on 25 December to parents Mary and Joseph. It is signed by the attending shepherds, witnessed by three wise men and carries the official stamp of the Judean authorities. ‘It’s difficult to know how to proceed,’ continued Trump. ‘We could oust the President on the grounds that he was not born in the US, but then he could smite us where we stand and damn us for all eternity. In hindsight, I can’t believe the founding fathers didn’t specify in the Constitution that the Commander-in-Chief’s mother can’t be a virgin or his father the deity of a major world religion.’ Disillusioned by Obama’s seemingly infallible status, some birthers are now turning their attention to questioning the credentials of other famous authority figures. ‘I think this Jesus guy maybe wasn’t all he claimed,’ said one. ‘Firstly, I’d argue that the King of the Jews lost his citizenship when his family fled to Egypt. And secondly, he was almost certainly a Muslim. Look, we found this birth certificate for Jesus Hussein Christ.’ 27th April 2011"
THE VERVE ACCUSED OF PEDDLING INADEQUATE FLU-REMEDY,1997,"The songwriter Richard Ashcroft and his band have come under close scrutiny with regards their connection between 90s rock music and the UK stockpiling £473m of Tamiflu in 2006. The Cochrane Collaboration claims the drug had no positive impact on the flu pandemic and there is a growing suspicion that The Verve’s No.1, ‘The Drugs Don’t Work’, was a clear mission statement for future clinical trials. This type of controversy has it’s origins in the 1970s, when private healthcare provider BUPA formed commercial links with pub band Dr. Feelgood, causing Malpractice to reach No.17 in the singles charts. One General Practitioner commented: ‘I’m not sure how pop stars can make meaningful diagnosis. Robert Palmer used to go round telling people he had a Bad Case of Loving You – I’m not even sure that is a legitimate medical condition. It’s simply ill advised to tell a family of a Girlfriend In A Coma to Live and Let Die or offer a Prayer For The Dying. And Athlete’s song Don’t Hold Your Breath, is simply cruel’. While representatives of Mr. Ashcroft were quick to distance him from the pharmaceutical industry, but they did admit his ‘Bitter Sweet Symphony’ was a tribute to his own adult addiction to strawberry flavoured Calpol. Meantime drug companies have consistently hidden data that relate to their products; including side effects such as My Chemical Romance’s ‘Cancer’, Madness’ ‘Cardiac Arrest’ or Foreigner’s less serious ‘Double Vision’. The GP added: ‘There’s a lot of dubious collaborations between drug companies and the rock world. Korn’s Love & Meth may seem logical but there are downsides. If someone says Myxomatosis has transferred to humans, don’t just take Radiohead’s word for it – do some randomised control trials. Although I think everyone would like an answer to Frank Zappa’s -Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?’. Subsequently the World Health Organization still classifies Tamiflu as ‘essential’, but it acknowledges criticism is also mounting for the band Placebo."
JEREMY HUNT TRIALS NEW HI-TECH ‘CONTACTLESS’ NHS,1265,"Fed up with having to deal with inefficient and often sick NHS workers, the UK Health Secretary has introduced a trial of ‘contactless healthcare’, which does away entirely with the need for any physical presence.  Just like an oyster card, your new NHS care card can be topped up with platitudes and sound bites ready to be deployed at any time you feel a touch of one-day flu coming on. Developed as a joint venture between CAPITA and ARUP, the new system will be run from a new purpose built data centre in Basingstoke called CRAPITUP, saving billions a year in missed appointments. Many in the NHS are still unaware of the impending changes and what it means for them, yet they will be some of the first to use it.  When the system is rolled out nationally many will be made redundant and likely need treatment for boredom. Critics have said that the Government is not listening to the people, but Mr. Hunt refuted this today, saying:  ‘Of course we are listening, and caring. We listen to everything, and then we put it in a big computer we call care.data.  The clue’s in the name – we care about your data because we can sell it’. If the technology is a success Mr. Hunt will not have to shake the hand of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury ever again rogerg"
US PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS READY TO BEGIN FIRST DVD BOX-SET BINGE FOR 17 YEARS,1282,"Federal museum employees across the US have prepared for a government shut down by amassing every boxed set ever released since the last government shutdown. ‘Back in ‘96 we were caught completely unawares,’ said Dwight MacMardell, superintendent of the National Yo-Yo Museum in Portland, Oregon. ‘So the only way to avoid three weeks of housebound boredom is to be prepared for it: long-life tortilla chips, an emergency microbrewery kit and an eighth of Lebanese Black.’ As the US government edges towards a shutdown, public sector workers across the country have started enacting their own carefully laid plans for unlimited free time, leading some to question where the money came from for every state office in the country to have two table-tennis tables, a beer fridge and multiple copies of The Wire. But some hoping to work their way through all five seasons of recent shows like ‘Breaking Bad’ have been left fuming by the online disclosure of key plot twists. One Museum attendant complained: ‘I’ve been saving up my TV watching all these years and the bloody internet keeps spoiling my plans. I mean, who knew that crystal meth was an illegal substance? Or that Bridget Jones would die alone? And apparently someone gets killed in Game of Thrones! It’s very frustrating.’"
SPANISH A&E MANNED BY BON JOVI‏,1111,"The American rock band, Bon Jovi, have agreed to support staff at the beleaguered, Hospital Niño Jesús in Madrid. ‘I’ll Be There for You’, insist the New Jersey boys, who have been juggling their paramedic training alongside stadium renditions of ‘You Give Love a Bad Name’. Cash-strapped hospitals in Spain have been refusing to accept patients carrying the European Health Insurance Card. Bon Jovi, having already waived their recent concert fees, feel they can help the economic health crisis with their rock ‘n’ roll anthems. Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora will be dishing at the ‘Bad Medicine’ while patients will be ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’. Drummer Tico Torres, insists patient care will not suffer: ‘You only have to look at our album ‘Slippery when wet’ to see how committed we are to Health & Safety.’
Thus far, Bon Jovi has released 12 studio albums but have yet to perform any invasive surgery. A band spokesman said: ‘Patients may feel ‘It’s My Life’ but things are no ‘Bed of Roses’ in Spanish healthcare. For Bon Jovi, unlike Spanish Health Ministry, all patients are ‘Wanted Dead or Alive.’ wrenfoe"
US BABY KISSING RING EXPOSED,2375,"America is in shock today as a major baby kissing ring involving prominent politicians was exposed on CBS documentary Newsnight. The scandal reaches across both party and racial lines, with Republican and Democratic politicians of both black and white ethnicity said to be in the ring. Estimates are that as many as 30,000 babies may have been kissed in the last few days alone. An unusual feature of the ring’s activities is that the baby kissing was brazenly conducted in public areas, often amongst a large crowd. In many cases the baby kissing abuse has been caught on film while crowd members chant ‘forward’ or ‘believe’. The extent of the baby kissing perversion is shown by the fact that ring leaders ask onlookers to give them an ‘approval rating’ and then to vote for them as if it were some kind of sick reality TV show. Shockingly, Newsnight revealed that many of the mothers of the babies stood by and let their babies be kissed in return for vague promises of ‘affordable healthcare’ or ‘cheaper gasoline’. Some have even photographed their child being kissed as a sick memento. US District Attorney Ralph Cerecke said his office has been monitoring people who kiss babies for political purposes, or ‘politicaphiles’, for years: ‘Politicaphilia seems to spike every four years, but as the ring members are members of the political elite they have previously been untouchable. But with the current revelations, we have opened files on the alleged ringleaders, a Mr O and Mr R. We are also looking at a historical case involving a Mr C who seems to have kissed babies before moving onto older age ranges.’ Sociologist Georgina Miller says politicaphilia is far from a victimless crime as it can scar the baby for life: ‘We have seen babies who were kissed 30 years ago now unable to function politically beyond wearing a Ronald Reagan T-shirt and joining the Tea party. Babies kissed 50 years ago are still banging on about the Vietnam war and ‘peace and love’ – in Houston of all places.’ While the baby kissing epidemic is now out in the open, people should still be on their guard. Ms Miller cautions parents to beware of smiling men bearing lollies, balloons, and rosettes, especially if living in a swing state: ‘But the babies need to take some responsibility themselves – the best protection against unwanted male attention is still shitting one’s diaper.’"
US ELECTION MAINLY ABOUT BUM SEX,2052,"As the US presidential election campaign enters its last days, pollsters say the result is still on a knife-edge. Whilst flag worship remains an issue for some, the electorate is split almost evenly over the crucial question or whether or not the right of people with the same number of penises or vaginas as each other to make their relationship official is any of their fucking business. ‘President Obama’s decision to come out in favour of legalising gay marriage was a pivotal moment,’ said political analyst Frank Luntz. ‘This appears to have solidified his lead among the 60% of Americans who aren’t mad. However, it has probably further alienated more of the 40% who believe that tax-funded healthcare is worse than slavery and that Elvis visited them on a UFO last week.’ In view of the record federal deficit, high unemployment and with many of America’s 300 million people barely getting by from one month to the next, both sides say that the economy is the key issue. However, there has been a tacit agreement to decide the leadership of the world’s most powerful country based on whether or not thinking about two men doing it to each other makes them go all funny inside. Republicans have condemned Obama’s move as a cynical stunt to shore up faltering support during the downturn, since the legalisation of same sex marriage is a state rather than a federal issue. Former Republican candidate Newt Gingrich commented that conservatives like him regard marriage as the unbreakable union of one man and one woman. None of his three ex-wives could be reached for comment. ‘Same sex marriage is unacceptable to Christian Americans, the idea is crazy,’ added Mormon Republican candidate Mitt Romney, who believes in a sacred book compiled on golden plates by ancient prophets who lived in America from 2200 BC to 421 AD, then handed to a confidence trickster called Joseph Smith in 1827 and which not only says that Jesus is going to return to Earth in Missouri but also justified Romney’s great-grandfather having four wives at the same time."
CLASH BETWEEN LIB-DEM DELEGATES AND BRIGHTON GUARDIAN READERS LEAVES TWO SAD,1144,"A run-in between Liberal Democrat conference delegates and local Guardian readers in Brighton has left two people sad and dozens very upset. Local juggler Adrian Newmanly was rushed to a local alternative healthcare centre and is said to be fighting for his short-term happiness. ‘It was awful,’ said local resident Rosie. ‘I was on my way to Infinity Foods to stock up on different types of tea and some unbleached women’s products, when I saw two Guardian readers arguing with a group of Lib-Dem delegates. The delegates were speaking very loudly and both of the Guardian readers were hyperventilating.’ The incident is believed to have started when a female delegate was walking along the seafront with her head in her hands when she strayed onto one of Brighton’s most notorious passive-aggressive hotspots: the beachfront cycle path. She was then almost struck by a Guardian reader on a recumbent bicycle. A PCSO who arrived on the scene first, said: “What? I am exhausted. I’ve just walked all the way from Churchill Square. What conference?” Nick Clegg has pledged to apologise to the cyclist at some point in the future. Dusty Bin Laden"
‘BONSAI BABIES’ – THIS YEAR’S MUST-HAVE ACCESSORY FOR THE BOOZY TEEN SMOKER,1740,"‘Bonsai babies’ that will fit in the palm of your hand until they are 3 or 4 years old have become the latest designer craze to create a buzz amongst the nation’s teenagers. Schoolgirls up and down the country have found out all they need to do to have their very own perfectly stunted and incredibly cute mini-baby is to follow a simple regimen of excessive smoking and drinking until late in their pregnancy; habits many are already pursuing with vigour. The new trend, which started life in the US with women who wanted less painful births, has been slammed by healthcare professionals and parents’ groups alike. But young girls including Holly Piggott,19 from Waltham Abbey in Essex, couldn’t wait to engineer their very own handbag-sized cherub. ‘It all started with those teacup piglets. I mean – cute, or what? And once I’d seen photos of those gorgeous little babies on the internet I knew I wanted my own teeny tot. I even took up smoking to make absolutely sure my foetus struggled to get the nutrients necessary to develop normally. I was already drinking heavily and didn’t see why I should stop at any point during my pregnancy, and after being told it would help miniaturise my unborn child I obviously increased my intake.’ Holly continues, ‘I’d never been much of a science fan, but me and the baby’s father Daryl – at least I think he’s the father – read a few papers in Nature that suggested it was almost guaranteed to get us the result we wanted. So now I’m really glad we attended that seminar at the hospital.’ Teenage parents have found there are other unexpected benefits of the ‘bonsai baby’ epidemic. As Holly revealed, ‘It saves you money as the little ones fit into VAT-exempt clothing well into their twenties.’"
AMERICAN CHILDREN DRESSING UP AS OBAMA THIS HALLOWE’EN,2242,"The surprise costume of choice for America’s children out trick-or-treating this year turns out not to be a witch’s outfit or skeleton mask, but the exact image of the President of the United States. ‘This is so much better than the vampire costume I wore last year,’ said eight-year-old Troy Winklemann, dressed in a well-cut suit from the fancy dress store and a Barack Obama mask. ‘Usually the grown-ups just pretend to be scared, but at all the houses with Republican posters in the windows, they’ve been genuinely terrified. Can we scare the shit out of them? Yes we can!’ Nine-year-old Nathan Pintle, a life-long Republican from Kansas, agreed. ‘This costume’s just neat. Obama is easily the scariest thing that’s ever happened to America – papa told me. The only problem is so far I haven’t got any candy. Instead people keep promising to vote Democrat if I’ll just leave their families alone, or frantically offering up their taxes and telling me to spend it all on Hispanics.’ As conservatives across the US prepare for a night of terror, the White House has taken the opportunity to reassure citizens. ‘There is absolutely nothing to worry about,’ said press secretary Robert Gibbs. ‘If children choose to go out dressed as the President, it is simply because they want to express their support for his policies. And please don’t try to pretend you’re not in. All these kids ask for is a Democrat majority in both Houses, and universal healthcare for all. We’d hate to see any terrified elderly Republicans suffer seizures they can’t afford to pay for.’ Right-wing politicians have fought back by encouraging their supporters’ children to dress up as self-confessed witch Christine O’Donnell, while advising homeowners to adopt the progressive politics of Sarah Palin and shoot any intruders on sight. Despite the good-natured political rivalry, things appeared to get a little out of hand in South Carolina when a group of diminutive Obamas were chased from town by a gang of Republican children dressed in white-hooded robes. ‘It was all we could find in our parents’ wardrobes,’ said one of the protagonists. ‘Besides, grandpaw always said you can’t bring about change from the bottom up, you’ve got to do it from the neck down.’"
BILLIONS POUR IN FOR INAUGURAL WORLD MONEY-THROWING CHAMPIONSHIPS,2277,"The world’s first money-throwing championships, announced only last month, have already attracted a huge number of entrants, each paying a large non-refundable entry fee. Even before the precise nature of the tournament is known, cash is flooding in from sponsors, lotteries and public donations, and great strides have been made in spending it, say organisers. Spokeswoman Fay Bartram said the first tranche of spending has gone on focus groups, steering committees, marketing consultants, PR advisers and several layers of middle managers. In a statement released yesterday, Ms Bartram said, ‘We hope to set up a proprietary state-of-the-art IT system sometime soon, after which we intend to move on to acquiring protected land and buildings and establishing a spending taskforce with its own watchdog.’ Although arrangements are still at a preliminary stage, it is speculated that there will be a full range of throwing events with targets that start with the pocket-money demands of individual competitors’ children to full-blown global bank rescues, with a climax which has been billed as ‘an extravaganza of quantitative easing’. The biggest players are expected to throw money at public projects, with President Obama and the UK’s NHS hotly tipped to meet in the final of the healthcare event. The United Nations and the European Parliament are also expected to feature strongly in the medal tables. Russian oligarchs are tipped to be major contenders in the commercial sporting arena. Given the large range of events and size of competitors, the amounts involved will be varied, from ‘fivers’ at the bottom of the scale to billions at the top, which for ease of throwing will be round billions. The organisers hope to raise sufficient funds to purchase their own black hole for the larger events. Asked about the still-undisclosed location and timing of the tournament, Ms Bartram said, ‘We don’t know if there will be a venue ready in time or quite what form the championships will take, but if we can ask everyone to dig that little bit deeper we should be able to get it over the line. ‘What we can say is that we expect to spend more than the organisers of the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 Olympics combined, which I think you’ll all agree is a massive achievement.’"
US ‘MAY TAKE MILITARY ACTION’ TO LIBERATE BRITAIN FROM THE NHS,2612,"After months of exhaustive research into Britain’s National Health Service in the name of President Obama’s healthcare reforms, senior American officials have now refused to rule out an invasion of Britain to liberate the country from the sinister tyranny of the NHS, which has been exposed by new CIA intelligence gathered from BBC footage of a death-camp known only as ‘Holby City Hospital’. ‘We have reason to believe that the British people are groaning under the yoke of this so-called socialised healthcare system,’ said a State Department spokesman. ‘We are seriously considering the need for urgent military action. But not before next Tuesday, when we’ll discover if the predatory anaesthetist is indeed the father of the foxy theatre nurse’s baby.’ The new evidence, presented by the CIA in a 45-page dossier and DVD box set, is a startling expose of the horrors of life under the NHS. It cites instances of British people being forced to wait for the personal lives of doctors and nurses to unfold in a dramatic and often predictable fashion before treatment is received. ‘Our interception of UK media channels has given us a full picture of the suffering of vulnerable British citizens,’ the report says. ‘Examining hours of Holby City footage indicates that whilst patients may find a degree of resolution to their complex emotional issues, they are still far more likely to leave the hospital with a sexually-transmitted disease than their appendix removed. It’s true that some of the antics are dramatic and entertaining, but it is clear that the healthcare system in the United Kingdom is socialism at its very worst – shabby, dirty, inefficient, unfair, cruel, clinical, and often badly-scripted.’ As the Pentagon debates the best strategy for occupying GP surgeries around the country and beginning the hunt for Nurse Gladys Emmanuel, Obama is believed to have abandoned his plans to adopt the NHS model for American healthcare, even though he has privately commented that the bed-hopping antics of British medics ‘sure look like fun’. But meanwhile the CIA is going back over decades of secret NHS surveillance to reveal the full horror of the British people’s suffering. ‘It’s time to take action and bring democracy to this poor, oppressed nation,’ said one traumatised operative. ‘I thought I’d seen everything, but we have further video evidence which shows that these alleged ‘hospitals’ are not only run by a terrifying network of nasal, mincing administrators and obese, tyrannous matrons, but many of them actively oversee the abuse of patients by sticking daffodils up their bottoms.’"
WAITING-ROOM MAN INSISTS ‘I SHALL FINISH READING THIS MAGAZINE ARTICLE FIRST’,888,"John Howarth, an outpatient at a Healthcare Trust in Hampshire, received a standing ovation from fellow visitors after refusing to see the doctor until he had completed the consumer review of ironing boards he was reading in March 2006’s Good Housekeeping Magazine. ‘They’d had me here since 8.45 but by then it was going on 11 and I’d just reached the conclusions section,’ explained Howarth, ‘so instead of leaping out of my chair as is usual, I just raised a finger and asked them to hold on a sec’. Following gasps of astonishment from fellow patients, the waiting room stood up as one to applaud the stance. ‘I’ve never seen one of them do that before,’ observed the clinic’s nurse, before insisting that he was sure that Howarth’s flouting of convention in keeping the doctor waiting would in no way be reflected in the approach taken to delivering his planned colorectal procedure."
