The Universal Antidote - Chlorine Dioxide Documentary (Video) ,2925,"
 I have produced several radio shows on chlorine dioxide with people who not only use it themselves, but have also recommended or administered it to others.  I make no claims to be a doctor, nor am I offering medical advice (If you need medical advice, consult your doctor), but I do believe that people are entitled to information to come to their own conclusions about their health and how to maintain it.  With that in mind, a brand new documentary has finally been produced on chlorine dioxide titled “The Universal Antidote.”  This is because people are using this for all sorts of ailments and it’s merely pennies to acquire without a prescription. For the record, since I discovered chlorine dioxide a little over a year ago, I have taken it both when feeling well and also as I felt like I was ill.  I can attest to seeing pretty tremendous results personally from taking it when I sensed the oncoming of illness.  I even shared it with my father who also saw a drastic improvement in less than a day. My good friend Bill Evans, The Truckdriver Theologian who funded the project to write the book Health For All Of Life by Dr. Jason Garwood and subsequently built the HealthForAllOfLife.com website, wrote this brief introduction to the documentary you are about to watch. The information contained in this documentary, which was just released yesterday, second only I believe to the Gospel of the Kingdom, has the very real potential, to not only change your life, the life of your loved ones and friends, but the world, saving countless lives, and alleviating needless death, pain, and the poverty that goes with them. It deals with a simple, but remarkable, all-natural chemical compound (CLO2 -Chlorine Dioxide) aka MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution. CLO2 is safe and extremely effective at treating a host of the most serious adverse health conditions known to man (influenza, staph, MRSA, Lyme, autism, Covid, Malaria, Typhus, HIV, & Yellow Fever, Cancer, etc.) and has been the object of relentless attacks by bigpharma and FDA censorship for a decade. This is a game-changer in humanity’s quest for natural health and medical freedom. As the producer of a book on natural health and wellness, Health For All of Life, by Dr. Jason Garwood, I encourage everyone in the gab community to watch and share freely! To those who discount the information as too good to be true, bear in mind, that the Gospel also sounds too good to be true. Not included in the documentary, are additional uses for CLO2, As a natural herbicide and pesticide, Household disinfectant, and treatment for a host of pet, poultry and livestock pathogens. Additionally, there is a reference guidebook to uses for chlorine dioxide below.

You Should Never Use Coffee Creamers Here's The Awful Truth Nobody Talks About (Video) ,4970,"
   by N.Morgan   Did you know that non-dairy coffee creamer is flammable? As it turns out, sodium aluminosilicate, an ingredient added to keep powdered creamer from caking together, can become flammable when dispersed. If you’re a coffee drinker who likes adding coffee creamers to your morning coffee, thinking they are healthier for you than real cream, think again. Non-dairy creamer can hardly be called cream at all; its a mixture of chemicals, oils, sugars, and milk products. Originally, in the 1950s, coffee mate creamers contained only sugar and cream. However, the manufacturers gradually replaced the cream and natural sugars with processed ingredients such as vegetable oils, chemical sweeteners, and additional additives. Today, powdered and liquid coffee creamers do not have any trace of actual food. The complete list of ingredients exactly as it appears on the label of powdered creamers: INGREDIENTS: Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil. (May Contain One or More of the Following Oils: Soybean, Canola, Sunflower, Corn, or Cottonseed). Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Dipotassium Phosphate Contains 2% or Less of Mono-and Diglycerides Sodium Silicialuminate, Soy Lecithin Artificial Flavor, Artificial Color.  Processed sugar feeds cancer cells, triggers weight gain, and promotes premature aging. Since processed sugar doesn’t offer any health benefits, your body tends to borrow potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium from healthy cells from different parts of the body in an effort to counteract the effects of processed sugar. Trans fats (found in partially-hydrogenated oils) cause heart disease, diabetes, and many other chronic degenerative conditions. After ingesting these trans fatty acids, they are incorporated into cells and the cells are hydrogenated. Surprisingly, the body cannot distinguish between cis and trans fatty acids. Hydrogenation of cells leads to increased rates of heart attack, sexual dysfunction, weakened immune system, cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity. Copper Home Page APeX Humic Fulvic Ultra Curcumin Corn syrup is a type of sugar (mostly dextrose) that is made from cornstarch. Corn syrup solids are produced when corn starch is bathed in hydrochloric acid which is an industrial chemical solution with highly corrosive properties that are also used in the manufacturing of plastics. Additionally, the corn itself is most likely derived from GMO varieties, which makes it even more toxic and dangerous. ( a milk derivative ). The chemical name for a protein found in milk, sodium caseinate is often added to non-dairy creamers to whiten them. It is also used in paints and plastics. It is associated with allergies, neurological conditions, and autoimmune reactions such as juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes. Dipotassium phosphate acts as a stabilizer to prevent coagulation in products like non-dairy creamer. It can cause: 1. Pneumonia
2. Acute renal failure
3. Nausea and vomiting
4. Diarrhea
5. Asthenia ( weakness )
6.Decreased hemoglobin These additives have either one (mono) or two (di) fatty acids attached to a glycerol (sugar alcohol) molecule. Typically, they are used in food to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would otherwise not blend well. Sodium aluminosilicate or aluminum calcium silicate are added to table salt to neutralize stomach acid. Sodium aluminum phosphate is an additive in most baking powders, cake mixes, and self-rising flour. If this form of aluminum combines with maltol, a sugar-like flavoring agent, the resulting aluminum compound is able to get through the blood-brain barrier 90 times as well. Side effects: Constipation. Toxicity, Side Effects, Liver Disease, Renal Failure. If you are not drinking your coffee black, you are missing out on the health benefits that coffee can offer. There is evidence that the milk interferes with the health-inducing flavonols, which Dr. Joseph Mercola pointed out as early as 2008. Dr. Mercola also noted that: Epicatechin, a compound found in unrefined cocoa, is another one of the powerhouse compounds that makes dark chocolate good for you, according to Norman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who has spent years studying the effects of routine cocoa drinking on the Kuna people of Panama….Unfortunately, epicatechin is removed from commercial cocoas because it tends to have a bitter taste…. So if you do choose to add cream to your coffee, make sure its the old-fashioned full-fat organic cream.

  HEALTH IMPACT NEWS -  Ever since reports have surfaced in recent days that people who have chosen NOT to receive the experimental COVID-19 shots but have been exposed to those who have received them, and have suffered what appear to be infections coming from these fully ""vaccinated"" people, affecting mainly women who have reported menstruation difficulties, heavy bleeding, miscarriages, and reduction of breast milk, I have been watching my newsfeed to see if any of the dissenting doctors and scientists we feature regularly here at Health Impact News would address these issues. Fortunately, a team of 5 doctors in the U.S., all of whom we have featured in the past here at Health Impact News and are highly qualified to address this topic, just held a round-table discussion a couple of days ago to address these issues. The issues they discuss affect ALL of us in the U.S. (and around the world) right now, and it is imperative that you take 79 minutes of your time to watch this video. Not only do these highly qualified doctors discuss why they think this is happening, they also give practical advice at the end about what we can be doing right now to protect ourselves and stop this attack on the human race by the Globalists seeking to reduce the world's population. Every single one of these doctors believe that these shots are NOT vaccines, but bioweapons designed to kill human beings. Whatever else you are doing when you come across this video, it is highly unlikely that anything else you do the rest of your day will be more important than watching this video so you can be informed of the evil effects of these injections that are being censored in the corporate media and Big Tech social media.

 “If you’re not on top of your diabetes, both the quality and quantity of your life is going to suffer,”   ”The earlier you know you’re at risk, the more you can do to live longer and better.” The Information Contained In This Article Can Help You Improve Your Quality Of Life! Research has shown that drinking hydrogen water decreased cholesterol, improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in a study (DB-RCT) of 36 patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance). The patients drank 900 mL of hydrogen water daily for 8 weeks. Although it may be a safe way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, drinking sufficient amounts of regular water alone may be helpful enough. Low water intake is linked to an increased risk of high blood sugar. Several biomarkers of oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism, assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, were evaluated at baseline and at 8 weeks. Intake of hydrogen-rich water was associated with significant decreases in the levels of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ie, modifications that increase the net negative charge of LDL), small dense LDL, and urinary 8-isoprostanes by 15.5% (P < .01), 5.7% (P < .05), and 6.6% (P < .05), respectively. Hydrogen-rich water intake was also associated with a trend of decreased serum concentrations of oxidized LDL and free fatty acids, and increased plasma levels of adiponectin and extracellular-superoxide dismutase. In 4 of 6 patients with IGT, intake of hydrogen-rich water normalized the oral glucose tolerance test. In conclusion, these results suggest that supplementation with hydrogen-rich water may have a beneficial role in prevention of T2DM and insulin resistance.

Scientific Report | 2 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21994426%20 “There are tradeoffs in health as in life: Should I spend extra time, money, and effort to be healthy”? Hydrogen water is simply water infused with hydrogen gases. Hydrogen gas acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and has antioxidant activity. These are the features that make it good for you. Links To The Studies Below. Prevention Is The Best Medicine.  HNEX™ was developed by a group of world-renowned European scientists with a patented technology that has been scientifically tested and shown to signal the activation of genetic pathways which can lead to positive impacts to all areas of your health. HNEX™ utilizes Silver Nano Particles as a base to attach a matrix of separate Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms. This delivers Oxygen to the cells and Hydrogen as a gas to the body’s immune systems. HNEX is a Direct Molecular Hydro & Oxygen Distribution Complex Highly potent and effective, this Nano Silver anchor delivery method is Antiviral, Antifungal and Antibacterial throughout its transportational action of vital Oxygen to cells and Hydrogen throughout the body. • Improve immune system health
• Modulate hormone balance to support vitality and wellness
• Help maintain a healthy inflammatory response
• Improve gut health and digestive enzyme production
• Help maintain cardiovascular health and support arterial elasticity HNEX™ is the first supplement on the market that contains active hydro-oxygen Nano structured molecules, providing powerful cellular messengers that help protect, rejuvenate and restore cells. Cell signaling in your body plays a key role in regulating gene expression. We are not talking eye color here — your genes do much more than dictate physical characteristics. Genes give life-sustaining instructions to cells, and cells carry out those instructions to keep you alive and healthy. As we age, cell communication breaks down, the signal weakens, and gene expression can be disrupted. Regulating gene activity with hydro-oxygen molecules keeps cellular
communication strong. Hydrogen gas is the smallest molecule in our universe. Scientific studies have shown hydrogen gas and adequate hydration can support the availability of clean cellular energy which our body requires for the proper function of tissues and organs. Within the body’s tissues and organs, Nano hydrogen is small enough that it can penetrate deep into human cells where our metabolism transforms the food we eat into cellular energy. At this cellular level, hydrogen gas and purified water provide essential metabolic functions that power both our mind and physical performance. The human body naturally receives hydrogen gas from the microbial flora that reside within each of us. These symbiotic microbes produce hydrogen gas as they help our bodies obtain nutrients from the food we eat. The microbial-produced hydrogen gas is then absorbed into our bloodstream where its biological benefits are carried throughout our body until we exhale this gas as we breathe. HNEX™ is an efficient way to directly deliver hydrogen gas into your body. Many of us are unintentionally filling our body with chemicals, toxins and the wrong foods which lower our pH balance. This acidic pH results in oxygen deprivation at the cellular level. This is the beginning of degenerative disease. Normal cells create energy via aerobic (with oxygen) respiration. Alkaline cells are able to absorb sufficient quantities of oxygen to support aerobic respiration. However, when cells become more acidic, less oxygen is absorbed, and the cells begin to ferment glucose in order to survive. This concept is essential to understand, because cancer cells thrive in an acidic, anaerobic environment and don’t do very well in an aerobic, alkaline environment. Disease Prevention Hydrogen water may contain antioxidants. Antioxidants help prevent oxidative stress. This type of stress comes from both normal body functions and external forces, including sun exposure and industrial chemicals. Oxidative stress may lead to cancer and other diseases. These preliminary studies also suggest hydrogen water may be anti-inflammatory, a quality that may reduce the risk of heart disease and other life-threatening diseases. How much HNEX™ should I drink daily? For those with chronic health challenges – Morning – 1/2 oz. (1 Tbsp) concentrate – hold in mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. It is not like oil pulling, where you spit out the oil after holding in your mouth. You swallow the HNEX™, as any bacteria has been eliminated by HNEX™, and it continues working once you swallow. Repeat daily. Daytime – add 1 oz. (2 Tbsp) concentrate to about 20 oz. of filtered water (not distilled water – it is acidic, not juice, not lemon water, etc.) Drink this mixture throughout the day, along with your intake of normal water. Repeat daily. Evening – 1/2 oz. (1 Tbsp) concentrate – hold in mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. Repeat daily. For maintenance: Morning – 1/2 oz. (1 TBSP) of HNEX™ concentrate, hold in the mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. (not distilled water – it is acidic, not juice, not lemon water, etc.) Drink this mixture throughout the day, along with your intake of normal water. Repeat daily. NOTE: We recommend taking HNEX™ concentrate at least 30 minutes before or after eating any food, because if you have any fresh fruits or veggies that you haven’t cleaned all the bacteria from, HNEX™ will go to work on that bacteria first before entering the blood stream. This is not a requirement, but rather a suggestion. HNEX™ may help minimize symptoms and reduce the duration of colds, flus and other viruses. In an acute scenario like this, the protocol is different than the standard protocol of 1 or 2 ounces per day. The protocol is to sip the HNEX™ concentrate all day long. Do not dilute the concentrate. You can drink an entire liter in a day or two. This does not replace the fluids needed to support the system’s detoxification process, so continue to also drink as much clean, filtered water as you can. Additionally, consider the action to nebulize the HNEX™ directly into the lungs and spraying the HNEX™ concentrate directly into the sinus pathways using a sinus spray bottle. HNEX™ concentrate can be applied directly to the skin to help with burns, cuts, scraps, rashes, and wound recovery. Simply spray the HNEX™ concentrate directly on the affected area, allowing it to dry naturally. Do this a minimum of 4x per day. It may also be beneficial to place a HNEX™ concentrate saturated cloth or paper towel, sized appropriately, and keep on the affected area. Keep moist by spraying concentrate on the cloth, or even wrap with plastic wrap to retain moisture. HNEX™ can be used with a nebulizer, for direct delivery into the lungs. Spraying HNEX™ in the nose and eyes can be helpful to hydrate these areas, as can adding a drop in the ear canal. HNEX™ may also be used with an enema or douche bag. 12 Years Although the primary targets or exact biochemical mechanisms of hydrogen are still not fully understood, the therapeutic effect in cells, tissues, humans, animals and even agricultural plants is becoming widely accepted due to the now over 500 peer reviewed articles and the 1,600 researchers working on the medical effects of hydrogen. Here are some useful links to peer-reviewed scientific articles on molecular hydrogen, research collaboration and many educational articles on molecular hydrogen.

"Backup Comms for Natural News & The Health Ranger: Emergency IP Backup Site, Telegram, Brighteon! - Mike Adams +Must Video ",3892,"
 By: Mike Adams / Natural News  The fascist techno-tyranny purge against humanity is under way. Rep. Devin Nunes has called for the arrest of all the Big Tech CEOs, demanding they be charged with criminal racketeering and civil rights violations. The CCP-led effort to take down America is now under way. Internet outages are already happening, and power grid failures are being reported around the world (Pakistan, the Vatican, Paris, Berlin, etc.). The Marxist Left will shortly unleash death squads across the country to seek out and execute all conservatives they can find. (See my podcast below: First they silence you, then they disarm you, then they KILL you.) Apple, Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Vimeo, Pinterest, Mailchimp and other tech giants are all committing treason against America. All their top managers and CEOs should be arrested and charged with treason. Their entire operations should be seized and shuttered, with their assets seized and distributed to all those who have been censored for the last five years. We call upon Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately order the State Dept. to seize the domain names of Apple.com, Google.com, YouTube.com, Twitter.com, Facebook.com, Vimeo.com, Pinterest.com and other techno-tyrants now involved in this fascist conspiracy to take down the United States of America. All these corporations were part of the rigging of the elections as well. They are enemy combatants engaged in acts of cyber warfare against the United States. Many suspect that the domain names of conservative platforms will be removed from all DNS servers worldwide. This would make it impossible for anyone to reach a website via their usual domain name such as NaturalNews.com. For this reason, we have set up an offshore backup emergency IP website that will carry out emergency audio and text messages as the global takedown accelerates. WRITE THIS DOWN. You can enter this into your browser to reach our backup site: http://45.89.97.6/ We have also launched a Telegram channel to carry emergency alerts.

Drinking Cow Urine Is Good For You? ,874,"
 Like millions of people, Jairam Singhal has diabetes. Unlike most of those people, he chooses to treat it in a manner most people might find repulsive: Drinking cow urine. Every morning for the past 10 years, Singhal, 42, has guzzled down a glass of pee harvested fresh from a virgin cow at a cattle shelter near his home in Agra, India. As gross as his medicine sounds, he swears by cow urine therapy. “I had diabetes, but ever since I have started drinking cow urine, my diabetes levels have been under control,” he said, according to the Mirror. “Someone told me drinking cow urine is good for health. “We have had cows here for over 12 years now, so first thing in the morning we take cow urine and drink it.” As a Hindu, Singhal believes that cows are sacred animals. read more http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/13/jairam-singhal-cow-urine-diabetes_n_4589652.html"
How to Tell if Your Gut Is Unhealthy  ,3994,"
 How to Tell if Your Gut Is Unhealthy The complexity of your gut is nothing short of incredible. In fact, the link between a healthy gut and your overall health is one that might surprise you. Over the last two decades, numerous studies have shown that an unhealthy gut is linked to a myriad of
unpleasant medical and psychological conditions. Microbiome Gut microbiomes are the microorganisms which live in your intestines. We have about 300 to 500 different species of bacteria in our digestive tract. While some can be harmful, many others are beneficial and even necessary. However, if your gut is unhealthy, you may suffer from ailments you never had before. And it doesn’t matter how healthy your diet or the quality of health supplements you take. If your gut is unhealthy, it manifests itself in a number of ways: Upset Stomach Stomach issues like constipation, gas, bloating and diarrhea are all signs of an unhealthy gut. When your gut is unbalanced, your body has trouble digesting certain foods, which leads to not only stomach discomfort, but also the often embarrassing above-mentioned symptoms. Changes in Weight Losing or gaining weight without following a healthy diet and exercising regularly can also be a sign of an unhealthy gut, particularly when it comes to men’s health. An imbalanced gut impairs your ability to absorb necessary nutrients. It also inhibits your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels and store fat properly. Unexplained weight loss can be linked to bacteria overgrowth in the small intestine, whereas weight gain is often attributed to insulin resistance. Sugar Cravings People who consume a diet high in processed foods and added sugar usually have a decreased amount of good bacteria in their gut. The imbalance between good and bad gut bacteria can cause excessive sugar cravings. Unfortunately, consuming excessive amounts of sugar, especially high-fructose corn syrup, can lead to increased levels of inflammation in your body. Skin Irritation Since inflammation is your gut can create wide-spread inflammation, someone suffering from an imbalanced gut might also suffer from chronic issues like eczema. Inflammation caused by a poor diet can cause leakage of certain proteins, which irritate your skin. Sleep Disturbances Poor sleep hygiene can lead to feeling poorly overall., but did you know that an unhealthy gut can lead to poor sleep, insomnia and chronic fatigue? Since the majority of your serotonin, the hormone that affects both mood and sleep, is produced in your gut, when things are off kilter, it’s not uncommon to experience sleep disturbances. Ways to Improve Gut Health Improving gut health is the best way to improve both men’s health and women’s health, says the experts over at Healthy Body Healthy Mind. First and foremost, you need to do a serious inventory of your diet. How many days do you eat healthy and how many do you consider a cheat day? If you have more cheat days than healthy eating, it’s time for an overhaul. You should strive for at least five days out the week following a low-fat, low-sugar diet that is high in protein and healthy fats. In addition, you also need to get your stress levels under control. While that’s usually easier said than done, it’s important for both your physical and mental well-being. Mindful eating can also go a long way when it comes to improving your gut health. Take the time to enjoy what you are eating as opposed to eating on the fly. Not only does eating on the fly cause excessive GI symptoms, but it also leads to overeating and poor dietary choices. Finally, try taking a probiotic to improve your gut health. Not all probiotics are the same, so it’s a good idea to check with your doctor prior to starting one. Final Thoughts Overall your goal should be to eat, sleep and be healthy. Since your gut plays such an active role in your overall well-being, it’s important to identify and treat any conditions which are causing it to function less than perfect.    "

5 Health Tips for Seniors ,3555,"
 As we get older, it becomes more important than ever to pay close attention to your body and your general health. Illnesses and injuries can become more common and are also more likely to do harm, so it’s important to stay in good shape and ensure that you go to regular checkups. Although getting old can mean more health problems, it’s still possible to avoid and reduce the risk of injury and illness by taking care of our bodies. If you want to ensure you stay healthy all year round and don’t suffer from any ailments, there are some tips you can follow. We’ve put together this list of the most common advice given by doctors to senior people. Remember that if you feel like you’re ill or suffering from something, always speak to your doctor. Being active and getting enough exercise is important throughout our lives if we want to maintain a good level of physical fitness and health. It’s easy to avoid exercise and stay indoors these days, especially thanks to casinos with free spins and other forms of online entertainment. However, if you want to preserve your health, you’ll need to get up and move regularly. Exercise is important for boosting our immune and cardiovascular systems, helping to fight infections as well as keeping our heart, lungs and arteries in good shape. The exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous, and in fact, doctors usually recommend against heavy exercise for those over 60. Low impact exercises such as swimming, walking, cycling and aerobics are still really effective for staying healthy as we get older. Our bodies are sustained by the food we give them, and much like a machine, the right fuel is needed to preserve general health and performance. Our diets should contain the right amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and good sources of protein. If you’re unsure whether your diet is suitable, you can always speak to a dietician who will be able to recommend changes if needed. As well as ensuring your diet is in check, you may also want to look at whether you’re getting the right amount of vitamins and minerals. These are essential substances for our body, and in some cases, they may be hard to acquire through diet alone. In that case, you may want to think about using supplements. Our bodies repair themselves while we sleep, and getting enough rest is essential if we want to remain healthy in body and in mind. Not getting enough sleep can affect mood, concentration and memory, and it has also been linked to a number of other conditions such as heart disease. Ensure you’re getting at least eight hours of sleep per night, and if you’re having trouble sleeping, you can speak to your doctor or take melatonin. Although you may have been healthy enough to rarely need to visit the doctor when you were younger, getting older means that problems can become much more frequent. In a lot of cases, these problems may be immediately noticeable, but in many cases, it may take a checkup from a doctor to discover them. For that reason, it’s important to schedule annual physical exams as these will help you to catch any problem before it has time to develop into something more serious. Stress is usually linked to the brain, but high levels of stress can also affect our bodies. When we’re stressed, our brain releases a chemical known as cortisol which can lead to serious effects such as a weakened immune system. As a result, it’s important to stay stress-free if you want to stay healthy. You can avoid and lower stress by increasing physical activity, getting enough sleep and relaxing."
How This Dad Outlived All His Cardiologists ,16256,"
 By Joette Calabrese

My Dad and the Dead Cardiologists: How Dad Outlives Them All With Homeopathy I put responsibility for my health care completely in my own hands. And the only way I or anyone can take this stance with such fervor is to know, down to our very cells, what we actually believe. I put my faith in a nutrient-dense diet and in homeopathy. This doesn’t mean I will never place a toe in the conventional medical arena. But that toe will be positioned there for mere moments for the sake of a diagnosis or to set a broken bone. That’s enough for me! I’ll slip from the sterilized mitts to return to my trusted homeopathy. Indeed, do I have confidence in my craft or not? Not blind faith, but robust, wholehearted trust in the data and clinical observations my colleagues and I have made in our professional and personal lives. Take my father, for example. He hails from an Italian-American family and was the second youngest of seventeen children. All except two of his siblings, as well as his parents, died before the age of 76. Over the last years, my father and I have cooperatively gotten him off all heart medications and kept him out of doctors’ offices. In a few months he will be 87. So far, so good. Here are the details of his story. At the age of 62 my father had the first of two myocardial infarctions. He had also been suffering tachycardia (rapid heart beat) for months before the incident. At the time of this episode his total cholesterol was a skimpy 112. For years, he had followed the Fit for Life diet: lowfat and vegan. Leading up to and including the 1980s my father was fully cemented in the conventional medical cardiac treatment protocol. He was dutifully compliant with his doctors in every way: he continued the lowfat diet, daily baby aspirin, Lipitor, nitroglycerin, calcium channel and beta blockers, and two more blood pressure meds. Nary a missed drug nor appointment. But his doctors didn’t always show up for their scheduled appointments. Something began to happen to his cardiologists. One by one, each died over a period of fifteen years. The grand total was six cardiologist deaths with only one of them to survive beyond his seventieth birthday! If these fallen medical men had been living according to their own counsel, swallowing their prescribed nostrums, and eating per their recommended regimes, then their advice would be at best specious, and more likely deadly. Two years after his first infarction my father suffered another attack and more drugs were added to his treatment protocol. But just before the last cardiologist died, he warned our family that if my father did not undergo bypass heart surgery, he’d not make it to his next birthday. That cardiologist’s surgical plan sounded more like highway construction than something done to a human body. He artfully planned to connect Route 33, which was partially blocked, to the New York State Thruway through my father’s leg, splice and redirect several more vascular roadways, and of course require the mandatory stop at the toll booth to pay. When I finally shook off my flabbergastion my first coherent thought was to consider the unconsidered. I said, “Dad, let’s get out of here.” My father gave it about an hour’s deliberation and then decided he’d take the detour and forgo surgery, thank you very much. Before my father reached his seventy-first year, that cardiologist died, too! Time For a Real Detour After years of conforming to the conventional medical canon along with mounting side effects from the drugs he took, my father allowed me to convince him to consider another way: homeopathy. It took time to persuade him to rely completely upon the homeopathic methods as well as a modified WAPF-styled diet [Weston A. Price], which turned out to be both a safe choice and a triumphant one. If you knew my father you’d understand that he doesn’t move quickly to alter dietary habits, so this remains a work in progress. We began with butter first, then coconut oil. Today he makes dinner for himself and my mother with these two saturated fats in every meal and he makes his own raw milk yogurt on a weekly basis. I must confide that getting him off commercial bread was a trial only a devoted daughter could endure. As for the drugs, the aspirin was the first to go. No persuasion was needed, since it had caused him gastrointestinal burning that he had simply put up with. In practicing homeopathy we don’t recommend that people heedlessly eliminate their drugs. Instead, we allow them to live with the newfound benefits of the homeopathic remedies for some time. This method allows the remedy to take up the slack so that the body no longer requires drugs in order to function. Once we observe this shift, the client is encouraged to see his doctor for help in getting off medication. However, doctors are not trained to get patients off drugs, only on how to get them on. In my father’s case, we skipped this step. Another detour! Early on, during the period of physiciandirected choices, and unaware that his doctor knew nothing of homeopathy, my father asked his MD’s opinion on using Arnica montana in place of aspirin. The doctor sniffed, “You can’t use those methods without taking risks. What are you hoping to accomplish? I take aspirin daily myself.” That doctor died five years later. It’s a little hard not to be smug. And so, it wasn’t long before we made a conscious decision to leave the conventional doctors out of our loop. It only caused undue stress on my father to argue with someone who had no understanding of drug-free methods, nor of proper nutrient-dense diets. Instead, my father simply began taking Arnica montana 6x twice daily and within several months he was done with aspirin. Since making this decision we have observed that when my father inadvertently cuts himself he doesn’t bleed heavily as he once did. This is reassuring, since a more sobering injury or surgery could have potentially resulted in hemorrhage. On a daily note, he no longer complains of chronic burning stomach, indigestion and constipation. The telltale ecchymosis, euphemistically called black and blue spots, disappeared. Another daunting symptom my father experienced through the years was angina, which accompanied even the smallest of activities. Walking to the mailbox left him in an anguished state because of pain and breathlessness. Arnica montana brought this complaint down to a mild purr, but Magnesium phosphoricum (Mag phos) 6x settled it completely. Instead of keeping nitro-glycerin in his shirt pocket, he tucked in a small bottle of Mag phos 6x and popped a few pills into his mouth as needed. After a few months, the need for this remedy was eradicated and Dad stopped carrying it with him. Mag phos 6x cured his angina. However, there still remained his cardiac dysrhythmia (irregular heart beat). His cardiologist, the one who died first, told him that dysrhythmia often ushers in cardiac arrest and is incurable. Naturally this symptom therefore carried the greatest fear factor for my father. Digitalis 30c became our remedy of choice, and this too can be used daily for many months, or years if need be. However, the dysrhythmia is likely to resolve in a much shorter amount of time if this powerhouse of a remedy is employed. Dr. A.L. Blackwood in Diseases of the Heart says of homeopathic Digitalis: “It not only relieves the palpitation but also diminishes and arrests the nightly emissions that so frequently accompany it.”Digitalis has a place even in conventional medical settings, but in that arena it is used in gross form. Unfortunately, as with aspirin, when a substance is used in material structure (as opposed to homeopathic dilution) it frequently causes side effects. In fact, the more “effective” a drug is in suppressing symptoms, the more likely it is to cause damaging side effects. In the original, gross form before it is made into a homeopathic remedy, Digitalis is a poisonous plant, the foxglove. Poisonous substances ultimately make the best homeopathic remedies, because when highly diluted and potentized, they become powerful medicines. The drug industry uses the original plant to formulate a synthetic version in the manufacture of the prescription drug called Digoxin. The difference between this synthetic version and the homeopathic is like the difference between aspartame and raw honey. For arterial sclerosis, we count on Arnica montana, but another remedy is required to be certain that blockage is not imminent: Secale cornutum (ergot). In his Desktop Guide to Homeopathy, Dr. Roger Morrison points out the following: “Secale cornutum acts mainly on the circulation. Allopathically, ergotamines are used for their (primary) vasoconstrictive properties; homeopathically, Secale is used for circulatory imbalances.” In my father’s case, we also occasionally counted on Aurum metallicum 200, which is especially valuable when heart disease is accompanied by depression. This remedy has a reputation for resolving the cardiac event as well as depression. [Editor's note: Aurum metallicum is also indicated for broken-heart syndrome! Or for when someone has poured ""their heart"" into something only to lose it.] Aurum arsenicum 200 is the remedy of choice at the critical time of cardiac arrest and in general for arterial sclerosis. Dr. Ramakrishnan reports that he has used this on thousands of patients. My father has counted on it when he has gone into tachycardia, with severe pressure and pain radiating down his right arm. After two doses of this miraculous remedy, the pain and heart flipping halts. So does the accompanying anxiety. He has used this powerhouse medicine for such acute situations as well as chronic conditions. After such events, my father counted on Aurum arsenicum 200 to keep this event from recurring. That was over four years ago and he has not had a recurrence. I also include the tincture, Crataegus oxyacantha (hawthorn), as part of his daily routine. It has a history of addressing hypertension and most important, as per Concordant Materia Medica, “[has] a solvent power upon crustaceous and calcareous deposits in arteries. Tincture, one to fifteen drops; must be used for some time in order to obtain good results.” How many times did my father hear that the only way to treat heart disease was to submit to surgery, take drugs for life, and abstain from saturated fats? These doctors overtly stated that there was no way to save his health other than to acquiesce and accept lowered expectations for his quality of life. But for you and me, lowered expectations are the least rational response! It only makes sense if we wish to cede control of our lives to the opinions of others. When it comes to chronic illness such as heart disease the model of modern medicine offers unreliable solutions that can usually be circumvented with intelligent alternatives. If my father and I flatly refuse procedures and drugs of commerce, are we thrusting our heads in the sand? Certainly not! For I have as much sure confidence in my medicines as does a conventional doctor who depends on his drugs. One doctor I didn’t count in my previous tally was a close friend of my father’s and a world famous professor of cardiology. He once said to our family, “The way to have good health is to get yourself a scary disease, then learn how to bring yourself back to health.” That is how my father and I approached his illness. If we believe that we should be personally responsible for our health, and when we depend on ourselves we discover that we are stronger, more successful, and take greater pride in ourselves and our work, then we make positive contributions to society. When you cure a family member, there is profound gratification not only in the joy of watching his or her suffering melt away, but in the blush of accomplishment. I want the heady experience of serving someone most dear to me. If that means I’m a rebel then I’ll accept that label. Just don’t stand in the way of my helping my father. Side Bars Schedule of Remedies It would be irresponsible of me to suggest that the protocol I devised for my father is indicated for everyone suffering from heart conditions, so this is where I must state that each cardiac case presents different settings, hence somewhat diverse remedies. Cardiac homeopathic choices are numerous, and I didn’t come to the following schedule without trials of other remedy considerations over time. Since I know I’ll be receiving emails and calls on precisely what we used, below is the schedule on which I’ve settled for the last many years. While items one through four below have been included in my dad’s schedule for years, items five through seven have been adjusted according to symptoms as they presented. I might add that the longer my father has been on this plan, the more infrequently certain remedies are needed. In spite of his age, he grows towards more vigorous health. This is not something you hear in conventional medical arenas, which routinely blame the patient’s age for the lack of response. 1. Arnica montana 3 or 6x, twice daily 2. Magnesium phosphoricum 6x, twice daily 3. Crataegus Q, 5 drops, twice daily 4. Secale cornutum 30, twice daily 5. Digitalis 30, twice daily 6. Aurum arsenicum 200, every 30 minutes in an emergency, followed by twice daily for months until the emergent setting clears 7. Arnica montana 200, every 30 minutes alternating with Aurum arsenicum 200 in cardiac emergency. Cardiac Benefits of Arnica Montana Versus Aspirin Arnica montana is one of our leading homeopathic remedies for the heart, particularly in relation to blood and arteries. As Frans Vermeulen states in his Concordant of Materia Medica, Arnica has the ability to resolve the following symptoms: “Angina pectoris, stitches in the heart, pulse feeble and irregular, cardiac dropsy, palpitations after any exertion, pressure under the sternum, anguish, collapse, beats shake the whole body.” Also, “Feeble debilitated patients with impoverished blood. Cardiac dropsy and dyspnoea. Marked effect on the blood, affects the venous system.” The very symptoms my father suffered at the time of his cardiac event are fully covered by Arnica montana. This medical book is a compendium of excerpts from the writings and clinical experience of Drs. Boericke, Phatak, Boger, Lippe, Allen, Pulford, Cowperthwaite, Kent, Clark, and Vermeulen. Also, Dr. S.R. Phatak in Materia Medica of Homeopathic Medicines relays the pathologies that Arnica montana can address: “Ecchymoses and haemorrhages. Relaxed blood vessels with tendency to haemorrhage, epistaxis.” For five years, I studied under the homeopathic physician Dr. A.U. Ramakrishnan, who is the medical physician to the president of India. In his hospital in India, he and his colleagues eschew daily aspirin for cardiac patients and instead prescribe Arnica montana 6x. Over the years, my client-students who have elected to use Arnica montana 6x report that this simple change has made a remarkable shift in their well being. If you are unfamiliar with the harms associated with aspirin use, consider the Mayo Clinic’s website, which reports:
 In the New York Times article, “A Hidden Danger of an Aspirin a Day,” Dr. Neena S. Abraham, a gastroenterologist at the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center says:
 Thus, not only will Arnica montana address the integrity of the blood, but it shores up the vessels. In that light, aspirin appears to be the wrong drug choice altogether, particularly when the vessels break more easily with its use.

Do You Have An Appropriate Health Insurance Cover? ,6320,"
 Taking care of your health has always been encouraged. There are so many ways of doing that, from appropriate diet plans, working out and regular visits to the doctor. The latter could prove to be quite an excessive exercise; hence having an elaborate health insurance policy could go a long way in assisting in cutting the costs. There are vast types of insurance covers hence you need to find one that is most suitable to you. Can one get health insurance twice? Yes, you can by having primary and secondary insurance. Primary insurance is a type of insurance policy that covers the necessities of your healthcare, while secondary insurance covers the residual balance for your healthcare. You are therefore encouraged to put a few factors into perspective as you purchase health insurance coverage. These factors include; The reimbursement quota. As you settle on the indemnification amount, you need to put your age into consideration. This is primarily because the younger you are, the more sturdy you are; thus, you would have a more robust immune system. This would mean that you require a smaller reimbursement amount. Your revenue should also be a crucial factor as you consider the amount you want to be used. The indemnification amount should be adequate for your health and considerate of your level of income. The acquisition procedure. Another paramount factor to consider is the process that you would have to undergo when taking a claim. The process should be easygoing to ensure that you will acquire the money as soon as you need it. The additional perks. It is always a good idea to search for a health insurance policy that would provide more than just a cover for your healthcare. The insurance policy should cover other aspects of your health that may not appear as crucial. The extensibility of the insurance policy. As mentioned above, your body becomes susceptible to diseases as you grow older; hence you should purchase an insurance policy to extend throughout your life. The parenthood benefits. There has been an increment in the cost of medical services. Maternity services have not been spared from this; hence having a health insurance policy covering these costs is an added advantage. You should check on the limit of the cover and how fast the insurance company can process your claim. The number of people that can be insured. You may be your family’s breadwinner; thus, the cost of medical care falls upon you. This can be very expensive, especially in a large family. Therefore, it would be best to buy a health insurance policy that can cover the whole family. The type of medical practitioner. Depending on the type of ailment that you have, a professional may be required. This could lead to additional medical expenses. Therefore, you should ensure that your health insurance policy covers these expenses to have a smooth treatment. The medication Some health insurance providers do not cover the cost of pharmaceuticals; this hence leaves the policyholder with exorbitant expenses. You should always ensure that there is coverage for your medication. The eliminated list. A health insurance cover is meant to cover a part of your healthcare; hence, specific healthcare segments are not covered. Therefore, as you select your insurance provider, ensure that they cover the essential segments. The number of premiums to be covered. This is a crucial factor as it determines whether you can afford the insurance policy. Depending on how often they need to be cleared, you should select an appropriate cover. Now that you have known what to consider as you choose the type of health insurance policy, how do you acquire the health insurance policy? Use of an intermediary. One of the most common ways to get a health insurance policy is through intermediaries or brokers.  Brokers are a coherent method as they have vast experience in determining the most appropriate health insurance policies. In most cases, the consumer does not need to pay any amount as the insurance providers pay them. Purchasing directly from the insurance provider. The majority of the people prefer this method as it provides them with an opportunity to inquire about health policies. As you seek the policy, you need to conduct a thorough research by visiting different providers to ensure that you have exhausted all your options. This task has been made easier as it can be conducted online, and the results would be effective. Use of digital platforms. Many businesses have opted to use digital platforms to grow their business, and insurance providers are no different. Therefore, you can provide your expectations from the providers, and these platforms will provide you with those that suit you best. Acquisition through professional bodies. If you are part of any membership organisation, then you have an added advantage. These organisations allow their members to purchase health insurance policies. There are specific discounts that you would enjoy if you purchased a health insurance policy through professional bodies. You are encouraged to conduct adequate research on the type of insurance that is being offered. Use of the government. Most governments provide their citizens with health insurance policies. These policies are usually deducted from people’s salaries. They are beneficial as they can cover the breadwinner’s whole family. These could go a long way in reducing the cost of healthcare. These are some of the ways one can acquire health insurance policies. The multiple procedures put in place allow one to have a variety to choose from. There may be more things to consider in each of the above organisations even as you purchase from them. An important factor is the type of health insurance policy that you want. The following are some of the most common types; ●    Health maintenance organisations-these organisations provide you with the opportunity to choose from a variety of doctors and hospitals. ●    Preferred provider organisations offer various providers, hence a more significant number of healthcare providers and facilities. ●    Point of service arrangements is a combination of the above policies but with fewer providers and lower costs. ●    Exclusive provider organisations-it provides numerous providers hence allowing you to have a lot to choose from."
The Universal Antidote - Chlorine Dioxide Documentary (Video) ,2925,"
 I have produced several radio shows on chlorine dioxide with people who not only use it themselves, but have also recommended or administered it to others.  I make no claims to be a doctor, nor am I offering medical advice (If you need medical advice, consult your doctor), but I do believe that people are entitled to information to come to their own conclusions about their health and how to maintain it.  With that in mind, a brand new documentary has finally been produced on chlorine dioxide titled “The Universal Antidote.”  This is because people are using this for all sorts of ailments and it’s merely pennies to acquire without a prescription. For the record, since I discovered chlorine dioxide a little over a year ago, I have taken it both when feeling well and also as I felt like I was ill.  I can attest to seeing pretty tremendous results personally from taking it when I sensed the oncoming of illness.  I even shared it with my father who also saw a drastic improvement in less than a day. My good friend Bill Evans, The Truckdriver Theologian who funded the project to write the book Health For All Of Life by Dr. Jason Garwood and subsequently built the HealthForAllOfLife.com website, wrote this brief introduction to the documentary you are about to watch. The information contained in this documentary, which was just released yesterday, second only I believe to the Gospel of the Kingdom, has the very real potential, to not only change your life, the life of your loved ones and friends, but the world, saving countless lives, and alleviating needless death, pain, and the poverty that goes with them. It deals with a simple, but remarkable, all-natural chemical compound (CLO2 -Chlorine Dioxide) aka MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution. CLO2 is safe and extremely effective at treating a host of the most serious adverse health conditions known to man (influenza, staph, MRSA, Lyme, autism, Covid, Malaria, Typhus, HIV, & Yellow Fever, Cancer, etc.) and has been the object of relentless attacks by bigpharma and FDA censorship for a decade. This is a game-changer in humanity’s quest for natural health and medical freedom. As the producer of a book on natural health and wellness, Health For All of Life, by Dr. Jason Garwood, I encourage everyone in the gab community to watch and share freely! To those who discount the information as too good to be true, bear in mind, that the Gospel also sounds too good to be true. Not included in the documentary, are additional uses for CLO2, As a natural herbicide and pesticide, Household disinfectant, and treatment for a host of pet, poultry and livestock pathogens. Additionally, there is a reference guidebook to uses for chlorine dioxide below.

You Should Never Use Coffee Creamers Here's The Awful Truth Nobody Talks About (Video) ,4970,"
   by N.Morgan   Did you know that non-dairy coffee creamer is flammable? As it turns out, sodium aluminosilicate, an ingredient added to keep powdered creamer from caking together, can become flammable when dispersed. If you’re a coffee drinker who likes adding coffee creamers to your morning coffee, thinking they are healthier for you than real cream, think again. Non-dairy creamer can hardly be called cream at all; its a mixture of chemicals, oils, sugars, and milk products. Originally, in the 1950s, coffee mate creamers contained only sugar and cream. However, the manufacturers gradually replaced the cream and natural sugars with processed ingredients such as vegetable oils, chemical sweeteners, and additional additives. Today, powdered and liquid coffee creamers do not have any trace of actual food. The complete list of ingredients exactly as it appears on the label of powdered creamers: INGREDIENTS: Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil. (May Contain One or More of the Following Oils: Soybean, Canola, Sunflower, Corn, or Cottonseed). Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Dipotassium Phosphate Contains 2% or Less of Mono-and Diglycerides Sodium Silicialuminate, Soy Lecithin Artificial Flavor, Artificial Color.  Processed sugar feeds cancer cells, triggers weight gain, and promotes premature aging. Since processed sugar doesn’t offer any health benefits, your body tends to borrow potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium from healthy cells from different parts of the body in an effort to counteract the effects of processed sugar. Trans fats (found in partially-hydrogenated oils) cause heart disease, diabetes, and many other chronic degenerative conditions. After ingesting these trans fatty acids, they are incorporated into cells and the cells are hydrogenated. Surprisingly, the body cannot distinguish between cis and trans fatty acids. Hydrogenation of cells leads to increased rates of heart attack, sexual dysfunction, weakened immune system, cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity. Copper Home Page APeX Humic Fulvic Ultra Curcumin Corn syrup is a type of sugar (mostly dextrose) that is made from cornstarch. Corn syrup solids are produced when corn starch is bathed in hydrochloric acid which is an industrial chemical solution with highly corrosive properties that are also used in the manufacturing of plastics. Additionally, the corn itself is most likely derived from GMO varieties, which makes it even more toxic and dangerous. ( a milk derivative ). The chemical name for a protein found in milk, sodium caseinate is often added to non-dairy creamers to whiten them. It is also used in paints and plastics. It is associated with allergies, neurological conditions, and autoimmune reactions such as juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes. Dipotassium phosphate acts as a stabilizer to prevent coagulation in products like non-dairy creamer. It can cause: 1. Pneumonia
2. Acute renal failure
3. Nausea and vomiting
4. Diarrhea
5. Asthenia ( weakness )
6.Decreased hemoglobin These additives have either one (mono) or two (di) fatty acids attached to a glycerol (sugar alcohol) molecule. Typically, they are used in food to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would otherwise not blend well. Sodium aluminosilicate or aluminum calcium silicate are added to table salt to neutralize stomach acid. Sodium aluminum phosphate is an additive in most baking powders, cake mixes, and self-rising flour. If this form of aluminum combines with maltol, a sugar-like flavoring agent, the resulting aluminum compound is able to get through the blood-brain barrier 90 times as well. Side effects: Constipation. Toxicity, Side Effects, Liver Disease, Renal Failure. If you are not drinking your coffee black, you are missing out on the health benefits that coffee can offer. There is evidence that the milk interferes with the health-inducing flavonols, which Dr. Joseph Mercola pointed out as early as 2008. Dr. Mercola also noted that: Epicatechin, a compound found in unrefined cocoa, is another one of the powerhouse compounds that makes dark chocolate good for you, according to Norman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who has spent years studying the effects of routine cocoa drinking on the Kuna people of Panama….Unfortunately, epicatechin is removed from commercial cocoas because it tends to have a bitter taste…. So if you do choose to add cream to your coffee, make sure its the old-fashioned full-fat organic cream.

  HEALTH IMPACT NEWS -  Ever since reports have surfaced in recent days that people who have chosen NOT to receive the experimental COVID-19 shots but have been exposed to those who have received them, and have suffered what appear to be infections coming from these fully ""vaccinated"" people, affecting mainly women who have reported menstruation difficulties, heavy bleeding, miscarriages, and reduction of breast milk, I have been watching my newsfeed to see if any of the dissenting doctors and scientists we feature regularly here at Health Impact News would address these issues. Fortunately, a team of 5 doctors in the U.S., all of whom we have featured in the past here at Health Impact News and are highly qualified to address this topic, just held a round-table discussion a couple of days ago to address these issues. The issues they discuss affect ALL of us in the U.S. (and around the world) right now, and it is imperative that you take 79 minutes of your time to watch this video. Not only do these highly qualified doctors discuss why they think this is happening, they also give practical advice at the end about what we can be doing right now to protect ourselves and stop this attack on the human race by the Globalists seeking to reduce the world's population. Every single one of these doctors believe that these shots are NOT vaccines, but bioweapons designed to kill human beings. Whatever else you are doing when you come across this video, it is highly unlikely that anything else you do the rest of your day will be more important than watching this video so you can be informed of the evil effects of these injections that are being censored in the corporate media and Big Tech social media. Then share this video with as many people as you can. _____________________________________________________________________   Related Articles: Fountain of Youth: Now You Can Turn Back the Clock Hydrogen Water & Ionized Water w/Silver Particles, Research for Your Immune System – 2021 the Year of Alternative Medicine.

 “If you’re not on top of your diabetes, both the quality and quantity of your life is going to suffer,”   ”The earlier you know you’re at risk, the more you can do to live longer and better.” The Information Contained In This Article Can Help You Improve Your Quality Of Life! Research has shown that drinking hydrogen water decreased cholesterol, improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in a study (DB-RCT) of 36 patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance). The patients drank 900 mL of hydrogen water daily for 8 weeks. Although it may be a safe way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, drinking sufficient amounts of regular water alone may be helpful enough. Low water intake is linked to an increased risk of high blood sugar. Several biomarkers of oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism, assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, were evaluated at baseline and at 8 weeks. Intake of hydrogen-rich water was associated with significant decreases in the levels of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ie, modifications that increase the net negative charge of LDL), small dense LDL, and urinary 8-isoprostanes by 15.5% (P < .01), 5.7% (P < .05), and 6.6% (P < .05), respectively. Hydrogen-rich water intake was also associated with a trend of decreased serum concentrations of oxidized LDL and free fatty acids, and increased plasma levels of adiponectin and extracellular-superoxide dismutase. In 4 of 6 patients with IGT, intake of hydrogen-rich water normalized the oral glucose tolerance test. In conclusion, these results suggest that supplementation with hydrogen-rich water may have a beneficial role in prevention of T2DM and insulin resistance.

Scientific Report | 2 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21994426%20 “There are tradeoffs in health as in life: Should I spend extra time, money, and effort to be healthy”? Hydrogen water is simply water infused with hydrogen gases. Hydrogen gas acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and has antioxidant activity. These are the features that make it good for you. Links To The Studies Below. Prevention Is The Best Medicine.  HNEX™ was developed by a group of world-renowned European scientists with a patented technology that has been scientifically tested and shown to signal the activation of genetic pathways which can lead to positive impacts to all areas of your health. HNEX™ utilizes Silver Nano Particles as a base to attach a matrix of separate Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms. This delivers Oxygen to the cells and Hydrogen as a gas to the body’s immune systems. HNEX is a Direct Molecular Hydro & Oxygen Distribution Complex Highly potent and effective, this Nano Silver anchor delivery method is Antiviral, Antifungal and Antibacterial throughout its transportational action of vital Oxygen to cells and Hydrogen throughout the body. • Improve immune system health
• Modulate hormone balance to support vitality and wellness
• Help maintain a healthy inflammatory response
• Improve gut health and digestive enzyme production
• Help maintain cardiovascular health and support arterial elasticity HNEX™ is the first supplement on the market that contains active hydro-oxygen Nano structured molecules, providing powerful cellular messengers that help protect, rejuvenate and restore cells. Cell signaling in your body plays a key role in regulating gene expression. We are not talking eye color here — your genes do much more than dictate physical characteristics. Genes give life-sustaining instructions to cells, and cells carry out those instructions to keep you alive and healthy. As we age, cell communication breaks down, the signal weakens, and gene expression can be disrupted. Regulating gene activity with hydro-oxygen molecules keeps cellular
communication strong. Hydrogen gas is the smallest molecule in our universe. Scientific studies have shown hydrogen gas and adequate hydration can support the availability of clean cellular energy which our body requires for the proper function of tissues and organs. Within the body’s tissues and organs, Nano hydrogen is small enough that it can penetrate deep into human cells where our metabolism transforms the food we eat into cellular energy. At this cellular level, hydrogen gas and purified water provide essential metabolic functions that power both our mind and physical performance. The human body naturally receives hydrogen gas from the microbial flora that reside within each of us. These symbiotic microbes produce hydrogen gas as they help our bodies obtain nutrients from the food we eat. The microbial-produced hydrogen gas is then absorbed into our bloodstream where its biological benefits are carried throughout our body until we exhale this gas as we breathe. HNEX™ is an efficient way to directly deliver hydrogen gas into your body. Many of us are unintentionally filling our body with chemicals, toxins and the wrong foods which lower our pH balance. This acidic pH results in oxygen deprivation at the cellular level. This is the beginning of degenerative disease. Normal cells create energy via aerobic (with oxygen) respiration. Alkaline cells are able to absorb sufficient quantities of oxygen to support aerobic respiration. However, when cells become more acidic, less oxygen is absorbed, and the cells begin to ferment glucose in order to survive. This concept is essential to understand, because cancer cells thrive in an acidic, anaerobic environment and don’t do very well in an aerobic, alkaline environment. Disease Prevention Hydrogen water may contain antioxidants. Antioxidants help prevent oxidative stress. This type of stress comes from both normal body functions and external forces, including sun exposure and industrial chemicals. Oxidative stress may lead to cancer and other diseases. These preliminary studies also suggest hydrogen water may be anti-inflammatory, a quality that may reduce the risk of heart disease and other life-threatening diseases. How much HNEX™ should I drink daily? For those with chronic health challenges – Morning – 1/2 oz. (1 Tbsp) concentrate – hold in mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. It is not like oil pulling, where you spit out the oil after holding in your mouth. You swallow the HNEX™, as any bacteria has been eliminated by HNEX™, and it continues working once you swallow. Repeat daily. Daytime – add 1 oz. (2 Tbsp) concentrate to about 20 oz. of filtered water (not distilled water – it is acidic, not juice, not lemon water, etc.) Drink this mixture throughout the day, along with your intake of normal water. Repeat daily. Evening – 1/2 oz. (1 Tbsp) concentrate – hold in mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. Repeat daily. For maintenance: Morning – 1/2 oz. (1 TBSP) of HNEX™ concentrate, hold in the mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. (not distilled water – it is acidic, not juice, not lemon water, etc.) Drink this mixture throughout the day, along with your intake of normal water. Repeat daily. NOTE: We recommend taking HNEX™ concentrate at least 30 minutes before or after eating any food, because if you have any fresh fruits or veggies that you haven’t cleaned all the bacteria from, HNEX™ will go to work on that bacteria first before entering the blood stream. This is not a requirement, but rather a suggestion. HNEX™ may help minimize symptoms and reduce the duration of colds, flus and other viruses. In an acute scenario like this, the protocol is different than the standard protocol of 1 or 2 ounces per day. The protocol is to sip the HNEX™ concentrate all day long. Do not dilute the concentrate. You can drink an entire liter in a day or two. This does not replace the fluids needed to support the system’s detoxification process, so continue to also drink as much clean, filtered water as you can. Additionally, consider the action to nebulize the HNEX™ directly into the lungs and spraying the HNEX™ concentrate directly into the sinus pathways using a sinus spray bottle. HNEX™ concentrate can be applied directly to the skin to help with burns, cuts, scraps, rashes, and wound recovery. Simply spray the HNEX™ concentrate directly on the affected area, allowing it to dry naturally. Do this a minimum of 4x per day. It may also be beneficial to place a HNEX™ concentrate saturated cloth or paper towel, sized appropriately, and keep on the affected area. Keep moist by spraying concentrate on the cloth, or even wrap with plastic wrap to retain moisture. HNEX™ can be used with a nebulizer, for direct delivery into the lungs. Spraying HNEX™ in the nose and eyes can be helpful to hydrate these areas, as can adding a drop in the ear canal. HNEX™ may also be used with an enema or douche bag. 12 Years Although the primary targets or exact biochemical mechanisms of hydrogen are still not fully understood, the therapeutic effect in cells, tissues, humans, animals and even agricultural plants is becoming widely accepted due to the now over 500 peer reviewed articles and the 1,600 researchers working on the medical effects of hydrogen.

"Backup Comms for Natural News & The Health Ranger: Emergency IP Backup Site, Telegram, Brighteon! - Mike Adams +Must Video ",3892,"
 By: Mike Adams / Natural News  The fascist techno-tyranny purge against humanity is under way. Rep. Devin Nunes has called for the arrest of all the Big Tech CEOs, demanding they be charged with criminal racketeering and civil rights violations. The CCP-led effort to take down America is now under way. Internet outages are already happening, and power grid failures are being reported around the world (Pakistan, the Vatican, Paris, Berlin, etc.). The Marxist Left will shortly unleash death squads across the country to seek out and execute all conservatives they can find. (See my podcast below: First they silence you, then they disarm you, then they KILL you.) Apple, Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Vimeo, Pinterest, Mailchimp and other tech giants are all committing treason against America. All their top managers and CEOs should be arrested and charged with treason. Their entire operations should be seized and shuttered, with their assets seized and distributed to all those who have been censored for the last five years. We call upon Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately order the State Dept. to seize the domain names of Apple.com, Google.com, YouTube.com, Twitter.com, Facebook.com, Vimeo.com, Pinterest.com and other techno-tyrants now involved in this fascist conspiracy to take down the United States of America. All these corporations were part of the rigging of the elections as well. They are enemy combatants engaged in acts of cyber warfare against the United States. Many suspect that the domain names of conservative platforms will be removed from all DNS servers worldwide. This would make it impossible for anyone to reach a website via their usual domain name such as NaturalNews.com.

Drinking Cow Urine Is Good For You? ,874,"
 Like millions of people, Jairam Singhal has diabetes. Unlike most of those people, he chooses to treat it in a manner most people might find repulsive: Drinking cow urine. Every morning for the past 10 years, Singhal, 42, has guzzled down a glass of pee harvested fresh from a virgin cow at a cattle shelter near his home in Agra, India. As gross as his medicine sounds, he swears by cow urine therapy. “I had diabetes, but ever since I have started drinking cow urine, my diabetes levels have been under control,” he said, according to the Mirror. “Someone told me drinking cow urine is good for health. “We have had cows here for over 12 years now, so first thing in the morning we take cow urine and drink it.” As a Hindu, Singhal believes that cows are sacred animals. read more http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/13/jairam-singhal-cow-urine-diabetes_n_4589652.html"
How to Tell if Your Gut Is Unhealthy  ,3994,"
 How to Tell if Your Gut Is Unhealthy The complexity of your gut is nothing short of incredible. In fact, the link between a healthy gut and your overall health is one that might surprise you. Over the last two decades, numerous studies have shown that an unhealthy gut is linked to a myriad of
unpleasant medical and psychological conditions. Microbiome Gut microbiomes are the microorganisms which live in your intestines. We have about 300 to 500 different species of bacteria in our digestive tract. While some can be harmful, many others are beneficial and even necessary. However, if your gut is unhealthy, you may suffer from ailments you never had before. And it doesn’t matter how healthy your diet or the quality of health supplements you take. If your gut is unhealthy, it manifests itself in a number of ways: Upset Stomach Stomach issues like constipation, gas, bloating and diarrhea are all signs of an unhealthy gut. When your gut is unbalanced, your body has trouble digesting certain foods, which leads to not only stomach discomfort, but also the often embarrassing above-mentioned symptoms. Changes in Weight Losing or gaining weight without following a healthy diet and exercising regularly can also be a sign of an unhealthy gut, particularly when it comes to men’s health. An imbalanced gut impairs your ability to absorb necessary nutrients. It also inhibits your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels and store fat properly. Unexplained weight loss can be linked to bacteria overgrowth in the small intestine, whereas weight gain is often attributed to insulin resistance. Sugar Cravings People who consume a diet high in processed foods and added sugar usually have a decreased amount of good bacteria in their gut. The imbalance between good and bad gut bacteria can cause excessive sugar cravings. Unfortunately, consuming excessive amounts of sugar, especially high-fructose corn syrup, can lead to increased levels of inflammation in your body. Skin Irritation Since inflammation is your gut can create wide-spread inflammation, someone suffering from an imbalanced gut might also suffer from chronic issues like eczema. Inflammation caused by a poor diet can cause leakage of certain proteins, which irritate your skin. Sleep Disturbances Poor sleep hygiene can lead to feeling poorly overall., but did you know that an unhealthy gut can lead to poor sleep, insomnia and chronic fatigue? Since the majority of your serotonin, the hormone that affects both mood and sleep, is produced in your gut, when things are off kilter, it’s not uncommon to experience sleep disturbances. Ways to Improve Gut Health Improving gut health is the best way to improve both men’s health and women’s health, says the experts over at Healthy Body Healthy Mind. First and foremost, you need to do a serious inventory of your diet. How many days do you eat healthy and how many do you consider a cheat day? If you have more cheat days than healthy eating, it’s time for an overhaul. You should strive for at least five days out the week following a low-fat, low-sugar diet that is high in protein and healthy fats. In addition, you also need to get your stress levels under control. While that’s usually easier said than done, it’s important for both your physical and mental well-being. Mindful eating can also go a long way when it comes to improving your gut health. Take the time to enjoy what you are eating as opposed to eating on the fly. Not only does eating on the fly cause excessive GI symptoms, but it also leads to overeating and poor dietary choices. Finally, try taking a probiotic to improve your gut health. Not all probiotics are the same, so it’s a good idea to check with your doctor prior to starting one. Final Thoughts Overall your goal should be to eat, sleep and be healthy. Since your gut plays such an active role in your overall well-being, it’s important to identify and treat any conditions which are causing it to function less than perfect.    "

5 Health Tips for Seniors ,3555,"
 As we get older, it becomes more important than ever to pay close attention to your body and your general health. Illnesses and injuries can become more common and are also more likely to do harm, so it’s important to stay in good shape and ensure that you go to regular checkups. Although getting old can mean more health problems, it’s still possible to avoid and reduce the risk of injury and illness by taking care of our bodies. If you want to ensure you stay healthy all year round and don’t suffer from any ailments, there are some tips you can follow. We’ve put together this list of the most common advice given by doctors to senior people. Remember that if you feel like you’re ill or suffering from something, always speak to your doctor. Being active and getting enough exercise is important throughout our lives if we want to maintain a good level of physical fitness and health. It’s easy to avoid exercise and stay indoors these days, especially thanks to casinos with free spins and other forms of online entertainment. However, if you want to preserve your health, you’ll need to get up and move regularly. Exercise is important for boosting our immune and cardiovascular systems, helping to fight infections as well as keeping our heart, lungs and arteries in good shape. The exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous, and in fact, doctors usually recommend against heavy exercise for those over 60. Low impact exercises such as swimming, walking, cycling and aerobics are still really effective for staying healthy as we get older. Our bodies are sustained by the food we give them, and much like a machine, the right fuel is needed to preserve general health and performance. Our diets should contain the right amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and good sources of protein. If you’re unsure whether your diet is suitable, you can always speak to a dietician who will be able to recommend changes if needed. As well as ensuring your diet is in check, you may also want to look at whether you’re getting the right amount of vitamins and minerals. These are essential substances for our body, and in some cases, they may be hard to acquire through diet alone. In that case, you may want to think about using supplements. Our bodies repair themselves while we sleep, and getting enough rest is essential if we want to remain healthy in body and in mind. Not getting enough sleep can affect mood, concentration and memory, and it has also been linked to a number of other conditions such as heart disease. Ensure you’re getting at least eight hours of sleep per night, and if you’re having trouble sleeping, you can speak to your doctor or take melatonin. Although you may have been healthy enough to rarely need to visit the doctor when you were younger, getting older means that problems can become much more frequent. In a lot of cases, these problems may be immediately noticeable, but in many cases, it may take a checkup from a doctor to discover them. For that reason, it’s important to schedule annual physical exams as these will help you to catch any problem before it has time to develop into something more serious. Stress is usually linked to the brain, but high levels of stress can also affect our bodies. When we’re stressed, our brain releases a chemical known as cortisol which can lead to serious effects such as a weakened immune system. As a result, it’s important to stay stress-free if you want to stay healthy. You can avoid and lower stress by increasing physical activity, getting enough sleep and relaxing."
How This Dad Outlived All His Cardiologists ,16256,"
 By Joette Calabrese

My Dad and the Dead Cardiologists: How Dad Outlives Them All With Homeopathy I put responsibility for my health care completely in my own hands. And the only way I or anyone can take this stance with such fervor is to know, down to our very cells, what we actually believe. I put my faith in a nutrient-dense diet and in homeopathy. This doesn’t mean I will never place a toe in the conventional medical arena. But that toe will be positioned there for mere moments for the sake of a diagnosis or to set a broken bone. That’s enough for me! I’ll slip from the sterilized mitts to return to my trusted homeopathy. Indeed, do I have confidence in my craft or not? Not blind faith, but robust, wholehearted trust in the data and clinical observations my colleagues and I have made in our professional and personal lives. Take my father, for example. He hails from an Italian-American family and was the second youngest of seventeen children. All except two of his siblings, as well as his parents, died before the age of 76. Over the last years, my father and I have cooperatively gotten him off all heart medications and kept him out of doctors’ offices. In a few months he will be 87. So far, so good. Here are the details of his story. At the age of 62 my father had the first of two myocardial infarctions. He had also been suffering tachycardia (rapid heart beat) for months before the incident. At the time of this episode his total cholesterol was a skimpy 112. For years, he had followed the Fit for Life diet: lowfat and vegan. Leading up to and including the 1980s my father was fully cemented in the conventional medical cardiac treatment protocol. He was dutifully compliant with his doctors in every way: he continued the lowfat diet, daily baby aspirin, Lipitor, nitroglycerin, calcium channel and beta blockers, and two more blood pressure meds. Nary a missed drug nor appointment. But his doctors didn’t always show up for their scheduled appointments. Something began to happen to his cardiologists. One by one, each died over a period of fifteen years. The grand total was six cardiologist deaths with only one of them to survive beyond his seventieth birthday! If these fallen medical men had been living according to their own counsel, swallowing their prescribed nostrums, and eating per their recommended regimes, then their advice would be at best specious, and more likely deadly. Two years after his first infarction my father suffered another attack and more drugs were added to his treatment protocol. But just before the last cardiologist died, he warned our family that if my father did not undergo bypass heart surgery, he’d not make it to his next birthday. That cardiologist’s surgical plan sounded more like highway construction than something done to a human body. He artfully planned to connect Route 33, which was partially blocked, to the New York State Thruway through my father’s leg, splice and redirect several more vascular roadways, and of course require the mandatory stop at the toll booth to pay. When I finally shook off my flabbergastion my first coherent thought was to consider the unconsidered. I said, “Dad, let’s get out of here.” My father gave it about an hour’s deliberation and then decided he’d take the detour and forgo surgery, thank you very much. Before my father reached his seventy-first year, that cardiologist died, too! Time For a Real Detour After years of conforming to the conventional medical canon along with mounting side effects from the drugs he took, my father allowed me to convince him to consider another way: homeopathy. It took time to persuade him to rely completely upon the homeopathic methods as well as a modified WAPF-styled diet [Weston A. Price], which turned out to be both a safe choice and a triumphant one. If you knew my father you’d understand that he doesn’t move quickly to alter dietary habits, so this remains a work in progress. We began with butter first, then coconut oil. Today he makes dinner for himself and my mother with these two saturated fats in every meal and he makes his own raw milk yogurt on a weekly basis. I must confide that getting him off commercial bread was a trial only a devoted daughter could endure. As for the drugs, the aspirin was the first to go. No persuasion was needed, since it had caused him gastrointestinal burning that he had simply put up with. In practicing homeopathy we don’t recommend that people heedlessly eliminate their drugs. Instead, we allow them to live with the newfound benefits of the homeopathic remedies for some time. This method allows the remedy to take up the slack so that the body no longer requires drugs in order to function. Once we observe this shift, the client is encouraged to see his doctor for help in getting off medication. However, doctors are not trained to get patients off drugs, only on how to get them on. In my father’s case, we skipped this step. Another detour! Early on, during the period of physiciandirected choices, and unaware that his doctor knew nothing of homeopathy, my father asked his MD’s opinion on using Arnica montana in place of aspirin. The doctor sniffed, “You can’t use those methods without taking risks. What are you hoping to accomplish? I take aspirin daily myself.” That doctor died five years later. It’s a little hard not to be smug. And so, it wasn’t long before we made a conscious decision to leave the conventional doctors out of our loop. It only caused undue stress on my father to argue with someone who had no understanding of drug-free methods, nor of proper nutrient-dense diets. Instead, my father simply began taking Arnica montana 6x twice daily and within several months he was done with aspirin. Since making this decision we have observed that when my father inadvertently cuts himself he doesn’t bleed heavily as he once did. This is reassuring, since a more sobering injury or surgery could have potentially resulted in hemorrhage. On a daily note, he no longer complains of chronic burning stomach, indigestion and constipation. The telltale ecchymosis, euphemistically called black and blue spots, disappeared. Another daunting symptom my father experienced through the years was angina, which accompanied even the smallest of activities. Walking to the mailbox left him in an anguished state because of pain and breathlessness. Arnica montana brought this complaint down to a mild purr, but Magnesium phosphoricum (Mag phos) 6x settled it completely. Instead of keeping nitro-glycerin in his shirt pocket, he tucked in a small bottle of Mag phos 6x and popped a few pills into his mouth as needed. After a few months, the need for this remedy was eradicated and Dad stopped carrying it with him. Mag phos 6x cured his angina. However, there still remained his cardiac dysrhythmia (irregular heart beat). His cardiologist, the one who died first, told him that dysrhythmia often ushers in cardiac arrest and is incurable. Naturally this symptom therefore carried the greatest fear factor for my father. Digitalis 30c became our remedy of choice, and this too can be used daily for many months, or years if need be. However, the dysrhythmia is likely to resolve in a much shorter amount of time if this powerhouse of a remedy is employed. Dr. A.L. Blackwood in Diseases of the Heart says of homeopathic Digitalis: “It not only relieves the palpitation but also diminishes and arrests the nightly emissions that so frequently accompany it.”Digitalis has a place even in conventional medical settings, but in that arena it is used in gross form. Unfortunately, as with aspirin, when a substance is used in material structure (as opposed to homeopathic dilution) it frequently causes side effects. In fact, the more “effective” a drug is in suppressing symptoms, the more likely it is to cause damaging side effects. In the original, gross form before it is made into a homeopathic remedy, Digitalis is a poisonous plant, the foxglove. Poisonous substances ultimately make the best homeopathic remedies, because when highly diluted and potentized, they become powerful medicines. The drug industry uses the original plant to formulate a synthetic version in the manufacture of the prescription drug called Digoxin. The difference between this synthetic version and the homeopathic is like the difference between aspartame and raw honey. For arterial sclerosis, we count on Arnica montana, but another remedy is required to be certain that blockage is not imminent: Secale cornutum (ergot). In his Desktop Guide to Homeopathy, Dr. Roger Morrison points out the following: “Secale cornutum acts mainly on the circulation. Allopathically, ergotamines are used for their (primary) vasoconstrictive properties; homeopathically, Secale is used for circulatory imbalances.” In my father’s case, we also occasionally counted on Aurum metallicum 200, which is especially valuable when heart disease is accompanied by depression. This remedy has a reputation for resolving the cardiac event as well as depression. [Editor's note: Aurum metallicum is also indicated for broken-heart syndrome! Or for when someone has poured ""their heart"" into something only to lose it.] Aurum arsenicum 200 is the remedy of choice at the critical time of cardiac arrest and in general for arterial sclerosis. Dr. Ramakrishnan reports that he has used this on thousands of patients. My father has counted on it when he has gone into tachycardia, with severe pressure and pain radiating down his right arm. After two doses of this miraculous remedy, the pain and heart flipping halts. So does the accompanying anxiety. He has used this powerhouse medicine for such acute situations as well as chronic conditions. After such events, my father counted on Aurum arsenicum 200 to keep this event from recurring. That was over four years ago and he has not had a recurrence. I also include the tincture, Crataegus oxyacantha (hawthorn), as part of his daily routine. It has a history of addressing hypertension and most important, as per Concordant Materia Medica, “[has] a solvent power upon crustaceous and calcareous deposits in arteries. Tincture, one to fifteen drops; must be used for some time in order to obtain good results.” How many times did my father hear that the only way to treat heart disease was to submit to surgery, take drugs for life, and abstain from saturated fats? These doctors overtly stated that there was no way to save his health other than to acquiesce and accept lowered expectations for his quality of life. But for you and me, lowered expectations are the least rational response! It only makes sense if we wish to cede control of our lives to the opinions of others. When it comes to chronic illness such as heart disease the model of modern medicine offers unreliable solutions that can usually be circumvented with intelligent alternatives. If my father and I flatly refuse procedures and drugs of commerce, are we thrusting our heads in the sand? Certainly not! For I have as much sure confidence in my medicines as does a conventional doctor who depends on his drugs. One doctor I didn’t count in my previous tally was a close friend of my father’s and a world famous professor of cardiology. He once said to our family, “The way to have good health is to get yourself a scary disease, then learn how to bring yourself back to health.” That is how my father and I approached his illness. If we believe that we should be personally responsible for our health, and when we depend on ourselves we discover that we are stronger, more successful, and take greater pride in ourselves and our work, then we make positive contributions to society. When you cure a family member, there is profound gratification not only in the joy of watching his or her suffering melt away, but in the blush of accomplishment. I want the heady experience of serving someone most dear to me. If that means I’m a rebel then I’ll accept that label. Just don’t stand in the way of my helping my father. Side Bars Schedule of Remedies It would be irresponsible of me to suggest that the protocol I devised for my father is indicated for everyone suffering from heart conditions, so this is where I must state that each cardiac case presents different settings, hence somewhat diverse remedies. Cardiac homeopathic choices are numerous, and I didn’t come to the following schedule without trials of other remedy considerations over time. Since I know I’ll be receiving emails and calls on precisely what we used, below is the schedule on which I’ve settled for the last many years. While items one through four below have been included in my dad’s schedule for years, items five through seven have been adjusted according to symptoms as they presented. I might add that the longer my father has been on this plan, the more infrequently certain remedies are needed. In spite of his age, he grows towards more vigorous health. This is not something you hear in conventional medical arenas, which routinely blame the patient’s age for the lack of response. 1. Arnica montana 3 or 6x, twice daily 2. Magnesium phosphoricum 6x, twice daily 3. Crataegus Q, 5 drops, twice daily 4. Secale cornutum 30, twice daily 5. Digitalis 30, twice daily 6. Aurum arsenicum 200, every 30 minutes in an emergency, followed by twice daily for months until the emergent setting clears 7. Arnica montana 200, every 30 minutes alternating with Aurum arsenicum 200 in cardiac emergency. Cardiac Benefits of Arnica Montana Versus Aspirin Arnica montana is one of our leading homeopathic remedies for the heart, particularly in relation to blood and arteries. As Frans Vermeulen states in his Concordant of Materia Medica, Arnica has the ability to resolve the following symptoms: “Angina pectoris, stitches in the heart, pulse feeble and irregular, cardiac dropsy, palpitations after any exertion, pressure under the sternum, anguish, collapse, beats shake the whole body.” Also, “Feeble debilitated patients with impoverished blood. Cardiac dropsy and dyspnoea. Marked effect on the blood, affects the venous system.” The very symptoms my father suffered at the time of his cardiac event are fully covered by Arnica montana. This medical book is a compendium of excerpts from the writings and clinical experience of Drs. Boericke, Phatak, Boger, Lippe, Allen, Pulford, Cowperthwaite, Kent, Clark, and Vermeulen. Also, Dr. S.R. Phatak in Materia Medica of Homeopathic Medicines relays the pathologies that Arnica montana can address: “Ecchymoses and haemorrhages. Relaxed blood vessels with tendency to haemorrhage, epistaxis.” For five years, I studied under the homeopathic physician Dr. A.U. Ramakrishnan, who is the medical physician to the president of India. In his hospital in India, he and his colleagues eschew daily aspirin for cardiac patients and instead prescribe Arnica montana 6x. Over the years, my client-students who have elected to use Arnica montana 6x report that this simple change has made a remarkable shift in their well being. If you are unfamiliar with the harms associated with aspirin use, consider the Mayo Clinic’s website, which reports:
 In the New York Times article, “A Hidden Danger of an Aspirin a Day,” Dr. Neena S. Abraham, a gastroenterologist at the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center says:
 Thus, not only will Arnica montana address the integrity of the blood, but it shores up the vessels. In that light, aspirin appears to be the wrong drug choice altogether, particularly when the vessels break more easily with its use.

Do You Have An Appropriate Health Insurance Cover? ,6320,"
 Taking care of your health has always been encouraged. There are so many ways of doing that, from appropriate diet plans, working out and regular visits to the doctor. The latter could prove to be quite an excessive exercise; hence having an elaborate health insurance policy could go a long way in assisting in cutting the costs. There are vast types of insurance covers hence you need to find one that is most suitable to you. Can one get health insurance twice? Yes, you can by having primary and secondary insurance. Primary insurance is a type of insurance policy that covers the necessities of your healthcare, while secondary insurance covers the residual balance for your healthcare. You are therefore encouraged to put a few factors into perspective as you purchase health insurance coverage. These factors include; The reimbursement quota. As you settle on the indemnification amount, you need to put your age into consideration. This is primarily because the younger you are, the more sturdy you are; thus, you would have a more robust immune system. This would mean that you require a smaller reimbursement amount. Your revenue should also be a crucial factor as you consider the amount you want to be used. The indemnification amount should be adequate for your health and considerate of your level of income. The acquisition procedure. Another paramount factor to consider is the process that you would have to undergo when taking a claim. The process should be easygoing to ensure that you will acquire the money as soon as you need it. The additional perks. It is always a good idea to search for a health insurance policy that would provide more than just a cover for your healthcare. The insurance policy should cover other aspects of your health that may not appear as crucial. The extensibility of the insurance policy. As mentioned above, your body becomes susceptible to diseases as you grow older; hence you should purchase an insurance policy to extend throughout your life. The parenthood benefits. There has been an increment in the cost of medical services. Maternity services have not been spared from this; hence having a health insurance policy covering these costs is an added advantage. You should check on the limit of the cover and how fast the insurance company can process your claim. The number of people that can be insured. You may be your family’s breadwinner; thus, the cost of medical care falls upon you. This can be very expensive, especially in a large family. Therefore, it would be best to buy a health insurance policy that can cover the whole family. The type of medical practitioner. Depending on the type of ailment that you have, a professional may be required. This could lead to additional medical expenses. Therefore, you should ensure that your health insurance policy covers these expenses to have a smooth treatment. The medication Some health insurance providers do not cover the cost of pharmaceuticals; this hence leaves the policyholder with exorbitant expenses. You should always ensure that there is coverage for your medication. The eliminated list. A health insurance cover is meant to cover a part of your healthcare; hence, specific healthcare segments are not covered. Therefore, as you select your insurance provider, ensure that they cover the essential segments. The number of premiums to be covered. This is a crucial factor as it determines whether you can afford the insurance policy. Depending on how often they need to be cleared, you should select an appropriate cover. Now that you have known what to consider as you choose the type of health insurance policy, how do you acquire the health insurance policy? Use of an intermediary. One of the most common ways to get a health insurance policy is through intermediaries or brokers.  Brokers are a coherent method as they have vast experience in determining the most appropriate health insurance policies. In most cases, the consumer does not need to pay any amount as the insurance providers pay them. Purchasing directly from the insurance provider. The majority of the people prefer this method as it provides them with an opportunity to inquire about health policies. As you seek the policy, you need to conduct a thorough research by visiting different providers to ensure that you have exhausted all your options. This task has been made easier as it can be conducted online, and the results would be effective. Use of digital platforms. Many businesses have opted to use digital platforms to grow their business, and insurance providers are no different. Therefore, you can provide your expectations from the providers, and these platforms will provide you with those that suit you best. Acquisition through professional bodies. If you are part of any membership organisation, then you have an added advantage. These organisations allow their members to purchase health insurance policies. There are specific discounts that you would enjoy if you purchased a health insurance policy through professional bodies. You are encouraged to conduct adequate research on the type of insurance that is being offered. Use of the government. Most governments provide their citizens with health insurance policies. These policies are usually deducted from people’s salaries. They are beneficial as they can cover the breadwinner’s whole family. These could go a long way in reducing the cost of healthcare. These are some of the ways one can acquire health insurance policies. The multiple procedures put in place allow one to have a variety to choose from. There may be more things to consider in each of the above organisations even as you purchase from them. An important factor is the type of health insurance policy that you want. The following are some of the most common types; ●    Health maintenance organisations-these organisations provide you with the opportunity to choose from a variety of doctors and hospitals. ●    Preferred provider organisations offer various providers, hence a more significant number of healthcare providers and facilities. ●    Point of service arrangements is a combination of the above policies but with fewer providers and lower costs. ●    Exclusive provider organisations-it provides numerous providers hence allowing you to have a lot to choose from."
Dr. Sherri Tenpenny:  How The Depopulation COVID Vaccines Will Start Working In 3-6 Months ,6043,"
 Dr. Sherri J. Tenpenny is an osteopathic medical doctor, board certified in three medical specialties. Widely regarded as the most knowledgeable and outspoken physician on the adverse impact that vaccines can have on health, Dr. Tenpenny has been a guest on hundreds of radio and national television programs (including the Dr. Oz Show and the Today Show Australia). She has lectured at Cleveland State University and Case Western Reserve Medical School, and has been a speaker at conventions, both nationally and internationally, as a recognized expert on a wide range topics within the field of Integrative Medicine including breast health, breast thermography, women’s hormones, medical uses of iodine and the adverse effects vaccines have on health.  She is also a voice crying in the wilderness concerning vaccines and current events.  Now, she is warning the public that the COVID vaccines’ depopulation effects will start in 3 to 6 months. Dr. Tenpenny has written, “According to the Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker, as of Dec. 26, 2020, 83 vaccines are in Phase 1, 2 or 3 human and animal clinical trials, with 18 approaching the final stages of testing. Never before have so many companies tested so many different vaccines at the same time, against a virus that has not been isolated. Of those in the trials, five vaccines are now early use, with three vaccines approved for clinical use Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.” “Are you willing to be injected with something unknown and never tested before in humans?” she asks. After all, humans are now the guinea pigs for these injections. Tenpenny warns that those who have taken the vaccine will begin to become sick and many will die within 3-6 months. This is a very clear expose on the Gates’ injections. Take a look at this eye-opening interview. Dr. Tenpenny also exposes the corruption of the AstraZeneca jab, you know the one that contains baby tissue. “This vaccine candidate is of interest because the clinical studies, done in collaboration with the University of Oxford, were widely publicized as the first and most promising vaccine,” she wrote.  “However, in May 2020, it was reported that all the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged. Then, why did the company press forward with the renamed, AZD1222 vaccine candidate? Because even though the vaccine did not protect the animals from infection, it did moderate the disease. Watch for this type of logic as the 80+ COVID vaccines try to make their way into the multi-trillion-dollar vaccine market.” She has also warned of a chilling ingredient in the COVID vaccines, the blue blood of horseshoe crabs. Finally, she has warned that every animal tested in a 2012 study that had been vaccinated for SARS-CoV virus and then had been re-exposed had serious issues. In a 2012 study of mice, ferrets, hamsters, and Cynomolgus monkeys, using various coronavirus proteins and various adjuvants, researchers reported immunopathology in every animal that had been vaccinated and then re-exposed to a SARS-CoV virus. Researchers clearly stated the following: This combined experience provides concern for trials with SARS-CoV vaccines in humans. Clinical trials with SARS coronavirus vaccines have been conducted and reported to induce antibody responses and to be ‘‘safe.” However, the evidence for safety is for a short period of observation. The concern arising from the present report is for an immunopathologic reaction occurring among vaccinated individuals on (re)exposure to infectious SARS-CoV, the basis for developing a vaccine for SARS. Researchers concluded the following: The SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, [viral] challenge of the mice given any of the vaccines led to the occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccines in humans is indicated. The Sons of Liberty’s health and wellness expert Kate Shemirani has warned: All animals in previous mRNA vaccines studies died when reintroduced to the virus in the mRNA. This is unethical to do in human trials. Deaths in animals; This is due to spike proteins. This mRNA injection is not a vaccine. It does not fulfil the legal definition of vaccine. It does however fulfill the definition of a device on:- https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/how-determine-if-your-product-medical-device The phase 3 trials should be of great concern. Not completed. This is when a cohort is watched through a period of 7-15 years to determine delayed ADRs. One cannot stop the cascade of events that will happen with an mRNA device inserted into each cell of the body. When you come into contact with the virus and your immune system is stimulated to get rid of the virus and your own body sees that you have the viral proteins in your own cells and organs and your memory antibodies… the mechanism that makes specific long term antibodies against a pathogen ….your adaptive immune system….YOUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS GOING TO START KILLING YOU. ORGAN FAILURE! ** the condition will initially present as sepsis and organ failure follows! Don’t worry about the phase 1 & 2 animal trials. This is the irreversible effect. We have around 10 billion miles of DNA. It’s our blue print. Our binary code. Our computer program. Take out one piece. Put in an extra piece. Translocate a piece from one place to another. You are changed forever. ** RNA or any RNA messenger can be potentially converted into DNA in the presence of the enzyme ‘reverse transcriptase’. Then that DNA could then link to your native DNA. There is the possibility of vaccine RNA being converted to DNA and then permanently inserted into your own DNA. People, you are being left without excuse at this point.  If you take the COVID vaccine, you have no one to blame but yourself should you fall ill or die.  You’ve been warned.

6 amazing health benefits of camel milk ,8680,"
 (NaturalHealth365) Believe it or not, camel milk has been used for over 5,000 years to help fight off germs, fight diabetes, support gut health, and provide the body with important enzymes. This milk was readily available in Middle Eastern countries even when water was lacking, and is still being used for its therapeutic benefits today. Camel milk has been deemed to hold superfood benefits, and research has shown that this milk contains more nutritional value than other forms of milk  On top of the many surprising health benefits, camel milk is also rich in unsaturated fatty acids, and is high in vitamins and minerals. The great news is that those with lactose intolerance will likely be able to enjoy this milk without the symptoms associated with drinking homogenized cow’s milk. In fact, this milk has actually be shown to reduce lactose intolerance. Camel milk naturally reduces anxiety and improves digestion Whether you are looking for a way to boost gut health, reduce anxiety, or support your child with autism, camel milk has you covered. I am going to share the 6 most amazing health benefits this milk holds, and why everyone could benefit from having this milk as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. For example, GABA is a neurotransmitter that is essential for brain function and has been thought to help naturally reduce symptoms of anxiety.  The great thing about camel milk is that it’s much higher in this neurotransmitter than cow’s milk, according to scientists at the University of California, Irvine. The GABA in camel milk is also thought to be more bioavailable – making it an excellent beverage for anyone who experiences high levels of stress and anxiety. On top of anxiety reducing benefits, camel milk is rich in probiotics – making this a great way to promote healthy gut bacteria which in turn helps to reduce depression and anxiety. What’s even more exciting is that there is a new and fun way to get camel milk into your diet through raw camel milk kefir.  This is a 100% natural probiotic-rich yogurt drink that has a delicious creamy taste and may even be able to boost gut health more than cow’s milk kefir. Great protein source: Camel milk contains 200 different types of protein This unique milk is rich in proteins making it a great way to bulk up your protein intake without consuming synthetic protein supplements or chowing down on enormous amount of meat products.  Protein is essential for nearly every process in the body, making it a critical part of a healthy diet. At King Saud University, pharmacologists found over 200 different proteins in camel milk. The best part is that some of the proteins found were immunoglobulin’s – which are responsible for helping boost the immune system. These pharmacologists believe that some of these proteins are so unique that they may even be able to be used in nutraceuticals in the near future. Autistic children experience the benefits of camel milk One of the most amazing health befits of camel milk, is that studies have shown that this milk may actually help support children with autism. A study was conducted at King Saud University that studied 60 autistic children and tested their levels of oxidative stress before and after the study. The conclusion was that the group who received camel milk as compared to those that received cow’s had lower levels of oxidative stress at the end of the study.  They also reported an improvement in behavioral and cognitive tests – which is positively attributed to the consumption of camel milk. A healthy way to control type 2 diabetes and prevent insulin resistance Although researchers aren’t 100% sure why this milk improved type 2 diabetes, what they do know is that an investigative study showed that camel milk consumption was able to reduce insulin resistance.  The mechanism behind this is unclear, but one theory believes this is because this particular type of milk contains ‘insulin-like’ small molecule substances that are actually able to mimic insulin interaction with the receptor. Dr. Uma S Dubey of BITS Pilani’s Rajasthan campus stated that ‘camel milk can be used to reduce the dose of insulin required by some diabetes patients.’  But don’t expect this kind of news to be published by the American Diabetic Association (ADA) any time soon.  Sadly, the ADA promotes the consumption of terrible quality food ingredients like genetically-manipulated canola oil and processed (demineralized) table salt. Surprising nutrition fact: Camel milk closely resembles human mother’s milk One of the most impressive benefits of this milk is that it’s thought to be the closest thing you’ll get to resembling human mothers milk. A study was done, analyzing 20 individual human milk and camel milk samples for fat, total protein, vitamins, and minerals. The result of the study showed that camel milk is considered to be a highly nutritious food and could be considered for therapeutic application. Camel milk has also shown to have the highest content of phospholipids and could possibly be considered one of the types of milk for infants and toddlers who need milk alternatives, not to mention the benefits this milk has for adults as well. However, if dealing with any health issues, it’s always best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet. Ward off cancer with camel milk in your next smoothie If you’re looking for a new way to kill off cancer cells, this milk may be the answer. A study published back in 2012 by the Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology states that camel milk (not cow milk) was able to induce cancer cell death in both HepG2 as well as MCF7   The study also showed that camel milk was able to induce oxidative stress-mediated mechanisms. How do you get camel milk? Camel milk may not be something you will find in your everyday grocery store, and will likely be best purchased directly – online.  While laws vary from state to state, in most states, the milk is allowed to be sold from farm to customer – but is not as likely to be sold from farm to store shelves.

"Amazing Update From The Tulsa Health & Freedom Event: Videos, Updates, Interviews & More!  ",3142,"
 By: Mike Adams /Natural News (Natural News) As you probably know by now, the world was astounded by a groundbreaking Health and Freedom event that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma this last weekend thanks to Clay Clark from ThriveTimeShow.com (the organizer of the event). Featuring speakers like Lin Wood, Gen. Michael Flynn, Mike Lindell and many others, the event was live streamed on Brighteon.com to 329,000 viewers, and millions more watched on other platforms. This article is intended to bring you videos and podcasts about the event while informing you of what else will be posted all this week (there’s a lot yet to come). First, the streaming of the event worked very well for those who have high bandwidth situations, but for low-bandwidth users, the streaming was intermittent. We are improving the multi-bitrate transcoding of the streaming engine to alleviate this for future streams, and in the mean time, we are posting the individual videos of each speaker at the event. These will be posted on the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com, beginning probably tomorrow: https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport In addition, we will be posting all the interviews I conducted there with remarkable leaders who talked with me privately, behind the stage. We had a recording room set up for this and were able to get amazing interviews with all the following people (listed alphabetically): Sidney Powell was scheduled to be at the event but had to cancel at the last minute and ended up connecting via remote video, so I wasn’t able to schedule an interview with her. In addition, we are scheduling at least another dozen interviews with people we met at the show who we didn’t have time to interview while we were there. In addition, I’ve recorded and posted two podcasts so far that cover the Tulsa events in great detail. Here’s the first one, which is today’s Situation Update podcast for April 19th: And here’s a second podcast, in which I offered a “behind-the-scenes” look at the event and some of the really funny, hilarious things that happened off stage (and also some profound lessons from God, it turns out…) I was also interviewed by many other shows and media outlets, including LifeSiteNews, NTD (with The Epoch Times), IAMTV and many others. I will post those interviews as I get them. One of the most fun interviews was with Resistance Chicks. They have a channel on Brighteon that’s really worth checking out: https://www.brighteon.com/channels/resistancechicks And here’s my video with them, where we talked about why a faith-based values system is absolutely critical for a sustainable civilization: The Resistance Chicks are hard workers like me, and they were doing tons of interviews at the event, posting them on Brighteon and other platforms. There’s much more coming, so stay tuned for more podcasts, videos and photos from the event. This event signaled that the good guys are fighting back to defeat evil and restore the voices of sanity for America and the Western world! https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-04-19-amazing-update-from-the-health-and-freedom-event-at-tulsa-videos-interviews.html"
10 Mushroom Health Benefits You Should Know! ,4759,"
 While they are top of the line in the supplement industry right now, they have a very long history of use. Medicinal mushrooms have been enjoyed by almost all ancient civilizations and the ancient Egyptians even called them the “plant of immortality”. Researchers are beginning to catch up with this traditional wisdom and demonstrate the health benefits that have been known for millennia. Since research has found that medicinal mushrooms can benefit more than 200 conditions, 1 I think our only question is how do we get more mushrooms into our diet. If you’re keen on mushrooms as I do, adding them to your diet is often easy. Shiitake mushrooms are amazing in eggs and casseroles, while mushrooms and cremini mushrooms are lovely additions to omelets and pizza. You can also use mushrooms in your soups. They’re a great way to boost your bone broth or make a tasty vegan mushroom broth. But what if you want the benefits of these healthy gems, but aren’t a fan of their texture or taste? Don’t worry, there are many options for you! Like capsules, tinctures, mushroom-enhanced protein powders, and you can even enjoy delicious hot chocolate with medicinal mushrooms. Regardless of how you enjoy them, you are helping your body find balance in MANY ways. Here is a small sample of his prowess in health promotion. Does your brain keep spinning with all the daily stress when you try to sleep? does one awaken within the middle of the night and feel some anxiety? The reishi mushroom helps your body adjust to all the stresses of your day. it’s a wonderfully calming mushroom that will help calm your mind in the dark, so you’ll get the sleep you would like. My favorite way to enjoy reishi is in a hot cup of Reishi hot chocolate. Combine my two favorite things: hot chocolate and a medicinal dose of this beautiful mushroom. We are always going to feel some stress every day, and our body may need some support when our stress is particularly high or continuous. Chaga, reishi, and cordyceps are adaptogenic mushrooms2 and help your body cope with life’s stresses and help your body adjust to unexpected problems Our immune system needs to be in a delicate balance, like a wobbler. Too much stimulation and your system can trigger chronic pain and inflammation. Too little and you can’t fight invading viruses. Medicinal mushrooms, like reishi, maitake, and turkey tails, are clinically proven to take care of that perfect immune balance. Prebiotics are food for the good bacteria in our intestines. When we lovingly feed our gut bacteria their favorite foods, they send us an enormous many thanks by balancing our gastrointestinal system and reducing indigestion symptoms. Mushrooms are packed with polysaccharides, which are long-chain carbohydrates and are the preferred snacks for our gut bacteria. Lion’s Mane may be a stunning white mushroom that appears tons sort of a large shaggy mane and is becoming known for its brain-protective properties. As we age, our brains tend to grow much slower and it becomes more difficult to establish new neural connections. Two compounds found in lion’s mane, hericenones, and erinazines, are found to stimulate brain growth. Some promising animal studies have found that it can also help delay memory loss and prevent the harmful beta-amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer’s disease. You don’t normally consider mushrooms as a source of fiber, but they’re they contain two very special sorts of dietary fiber, beta-glucans, and chitin, which may increase satiety and reduce appetite. They are also packed with B vitamins that help the body turn food into fuel and metabolize protein and fat. Buy shrooms online The mushrooms found in most grocery stores, add a smoky flavor to stir-fries and stews. Research has found that they contain a cholesterol-lowering compound, which helps the body reabsorb any additional cholesterol it’s producing. Antioxidant-rich foods are usually super colorful, and the soft beige or white color of mushrooms doesn’t scream antioxidants. But they are LOADED with them! Crimini and Portobello mushrooms have the same antioxidant power as a dash of red pepper. With a healthy dose of the antioxidant glutathione for longevity, as well as selenium, B vitamins, and even vitamin D it’s not surprising that mushrooms appear on most experts’ longevity foods list. The reishi mushroom has been called the “mushroom of immortality” and that makes my cup of reishi hot cocoa at night even more delicious. Mushrooms play a really important role within the environment. In forests, they provide an important root system that helps trees communicate with each other and helps break down organic matter in the forest floor. But the coolest research I’ve seen is how they could save the planet."
Vitamin B12 deficiency – all you need to know ,1791,"
 Please read this extensive work on Vitamin B12 deficiency; it is a vastly underestimated problem and should be taken much more seriously. Dr. Nandita Shah has gathered a wide range of information on this matter – we hope you’ll get something valuable out of it.   by Dr. Nandita Shah In a random test on 21 diabetics conducted by us, we found that about half of them had B12 deficiency, and none of them were vegan. Of those who were not deficient, some were on B complex supplements, which included vitamin B12.   Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria and micro organisms. Meat and milk are full of bacteria because they are decaying substances and so these foods have plenty of B12. However, many non-vegetarians and vegetarians, especially those aged 35 and up are deficient too. Vitamin B12 is absorbed by the intrinsic factor in the stomach. High protein from meat and milk force the stomach to produce more acid to digest them. (Proteins are digested mainly in the stomach.) This high acid secretion not only is one of the causes of acidity but also destroys the lining of the stomach so that the intrinsic factor is deficient. Thus vitamin B12 is not absorbed. Non-vegetarians and vegetarians who become vitamin B12 deficient may not be able to absorb vitamin B12 and need to take injections. Vegans may be able to absorb vitamin B12 but are unlikely to get enough of it on a plant-based diet. This is because of our present-day lives which are unnaturally hygienic. Micro organisms naturally available in our food are destroyed or removed due to:   In a more natural world, vitamin B12 could be naturally available to vegans in the form of organic fruits and vegetables straight off the farm, pond water, river water or other natural drinking water, etc. READ MORE   organictalks.com"
Rosemary and Oregano Contain Diabetes-fighting Compounds ,1661,"
 The popular culinary herbs oregano and rosemary are packed with healthful compounds, and now lab tests show they could work in much the same way as prescription anti-diabetic medication, scientists report. In their new study published in ACS’ Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, they found that how the herbs are grown makes a difference, and they also identified which compounds contribute the most to this promising trait. Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia and colleagues point out that in 2012, type-2 diabetes affected more than 8 percent of Americans and cost the country $175 billion. Some people can manage the disease with exercise and changes to their diet, and others take medication. But not everyone can stick to a new lifestyle or afford the prescription drugs necessary to keep their blood-sugar level in check. Recent research has shown that herbs could provide a natural way to help lower glucose in blood. So Gonzalez de Mejia’s team decided to take a closer look. They tested four different herbs, either greenhouse-grown or dried commercial versions, for their ability to interfere with a diabetes-related enzyme, which is also a target of a prescription drug for the disease. They found that greenhouse herbs contained more polyphenols and flavonoids compared to the equivalent commercial herbs. But this didn’t affect the concentration required to inhibit the enzyme. Commercial extracts of Greek oregano, Mexican oregano and rosemary were better inhibitors of the enzyme, required to reduce risk of type-2 diabetes, than greenhouse-grown herbs.

10 Health Benefits Of A Clean House ,4088,"
 Reduces allergies Regular cleaning is the best way to reduce dust and other irritating allergens from the home. Chores like sweeping, dusting, and vacuuming dispose of dust, dust mites, pet dander, and dozens of other allergens that cause cold and flu-like symptoms. People with allergies, asthma, and respiratory problems can relieve their symptoms and breathe easier by keeping their house clean. Sanitation Every time you clean the house with disinfectants, you are killing bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that can compromise your health. These powerful cleansers target germs and bacteria, such as E. coli, staph, and salmonella that are responsible for many foodborne illnesses and infections. Sanitizing surfaces in the kitchen, bathroom, and other areas of the house will help protect you from these potentially dangerous bacteria. Reduces mold Keeping your house clean provides more opportunities to detect mold growth and fix the problem in a timely manner. Mold can wreck havoc on people’s health, causing allergic reactions, cold and flu-like symptoms, asthma attacks, and other severe health problems. Regular cleaning and inspections help control and prevent mold growth. Lowers risk of injury Keeping your house clean and organized can reduce the chance of injury by minimizing clutter and keeping things out of harm’s way. Leaving loose items around like toys may increase the risk of trips and falls. Stacks of boxes and other large piles can easily fall on top of someone and injure them. Simply tidying up and organizing can make a huge difference in the overall safety of your home. Reduces stress Both the act of cleaning and maintaining a clean house can help relieve and prevent unnecessary stress. A clean house makes maneuvering and finding things much easier. Easy cleaning like sweeping, doing the dishes, and making your bed will make your house look clean and ready for guests if the opportunity arises. Wards off pests In general, bugs and other household pests like warm, damp environments and they have a tendency to disguise themselves in dusty, untidy areas. Regular cleaning helps occupants discover pest problems and treat them accordingly. In addition to regular exterminations, simple chores like taking out the garbage, sweeping, and vacuuming keeps bugs and other pests from making your home their nesting ground. Burns calories Cleaning doesn’t just make your home look spick and span, it also burns calories. Everything from sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, and hand washing the dishes can make you work up a sweat and burn off calories. To increase your calorie burn, dance to your favorite tunes while cleaning the house for at least an hour. Encourages cooking A dirty and unorganized kitchen can deter people from cooking at home because they don’t want to make the mess even worse. A clean kitchen is much more inviting than a messy one. Washing the dishes, wiping down the countertops, and cleaning out the refrigerator allow the kitchen to serve as a functional workspace where you can cook healthy meals for the whole family. Improves mental state Let’s face it: there’s nothing better than walking into a house that is clean and organized. In fact, the process of cleaning and de-cluttering has been known to provide many mental health benefits. From the physical movements to the completion of a task, people find cleaning very cathartic. It’s also a great way to release frustration, anxiety, and anger. Reduces health and safety hazards A clean house can mean the difference between life and death. Those who live in an unsanitary environment are more susceptible to illnesses caused by bacteria, allergens, and pests. An untidy home can also be a safety hazard for its occupants. Clutter is a fire hazard and can physically trap occupants inside their homes, preventing them from escaping in an emergency. Cleaning frees up space and keeps messes from becoming serious hazards.

"Doctors Astonished as New Product Peer Reviews Become Public, Can't Deny Health Benefits ",35587,"
 Many people are testifying that they can finally get off their prescription medications armed with this knowledge. Although the primary targets or exact biochemical mechanisms of hydrogen are still not fully understood, the therapeutic effect in cells, tissues, humans, animals and even agricultural plants is becoming widely accepted due to the now over 500 peer reviewed articles and the 1,600 researchers working on the medical effects of hydrogen. Here are some useful links to peer-reviewed scientific articles on molecular hydrogen, research collaboration and many educational articles on molecular hydrogen. 27 Health Benefits of Hydrogen Water 1). Hydrogen Water is an Antioxidant and Protects the Brain It was first shown that molecular hydrogen (H2) could protect from damage by reducing the most toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. Inhaled hydrogen also easily reached the brain to reduce injury in rats with stroke. In the first pilot study of 38 stroke patients, a hydrogen solution (IV) was safe and had a mild antioxidant effect. In a small study (DB-RCT) of 17 patients with Parkinson’s disease, those who drank hydrogen water had improved symptoms. Those who drank regular “placebo” water, however, experienced a worsening. There were also no adverse effects to drinking 1L of hydrogen water daily for almost one year. No study so far has looked at the effect of hydrogen water alone on Parkinson’s Disease, though. In the completed studies, patients drank hydrogen water as an add-on to regular medications. In rats, hydrogen water reduced oxidative stress and prevented Parkinson’s Disease. Curiously, hydrogen seems to achieve better results with lower doses. Rats who drank hydrogen water did better than those who constantly received higher amounts of hydrogen intravenously. Hydrogen water prevented cognitive, learning, and memory problems in mice under stress by acting as an antioxidant. It also protected cells in the brain’s memory hub — the hippocampus — from the detrimental effects of stress. Hydrogen water could potentially be used to prevent cognitive and stress-induced disorders with more research. Antioxidant & Brain-Protective Effects – Infusing molecular hydrogen into water has been shown to act by reducing the most toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) which protects the cells from damage. A pilot study of 38 stroke patients showed that hydrogen water was safe and had a mild antioxidant effect. • Scientific Report | 1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17486089/

Although it may be a safe way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, drinking sufficient amounts of regular water alone may be helpful enough. Low water intake is linked to an increased risk of high blood sugar. • Scientific Report | 1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19083400%20
• Scientific Report | 2 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21994426%20 9). Hydrogen Water May Alkalize the Body Metabolic acidosis is when the blood drops and becomes more acidic, which can happen from intense exercise. Drinking 2 L of hydrogen water daily increased the blood pH before and after exercise after 2 weeks with no side effects in a study of 52 healthy, active men (DB-RCT). Hydrogen water was safe and had an alkalizing effect on the blood that can neutralize the post-exercise pH dip. 10). Hydrogen Water May Fight Cancer So far, only cellular studies point to the potential of hydrogen water for fighting cancer. Hydrogen water combined with increased temperature (hyperthermia) had a strong cancer-killing effect in cells. In human cancer cells, hydrogen water suppressed tumor growth by reducing oxidative stress. Hydrogen water also blocked the creation of new blood vessels in human lung cancer cells, preventing cancer from spreading and growing. 11). Hydrogen Water May Reduce Side Effects of Chemotherapy and Radiation In one study (RCT) of 49 patients on radiation therapy for liver cancer, drinking hydrogen water (1.5 – 2 L/day) improved the patients’ quality of life and appetite. Hydrogen water could reduce oxidative stress and damage from radiation without compromising its cancer-killing effects. In mice, drinking hydrogen water increased survival, reduced kidney damage and weight loss from a chemotherapy drug (cisplatin). 12). Hydrogen Water Boosts Skin Health Hydrogen water given through an IV solution safely improved skin health in 4 patients with skin redness and inflammation, and pain. The skin redness went away after a couple of days of treatment and did not come back. Bathing in hydrogen water for 3 months noticeably reduced skin wrinkles in 6 people. Hydrogen water could also boost collagen production, reduce UV damage and act as an antioxidant in skin cells. Warm hydrogen-infused baths could be a pleasant, safe way to reverse skin aging. Boosts Skin Health – Hydrogen water has been shown to help boost collagen production, reduce UV damage and act as an antioxidant in skin cells. This shows the potential of hydrogen water as a pleasant and safe way to reverse skin aging. The use of hydrogen water improved skin health in patients with skin redness and inflammation/pain. • Scientific Report | 1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22607973/

Hydrogen water reduced inflammation and oxidative stress (by reducing NF-κB). 23). Hydrogen Water May Protect From Radiation Molecular hydrogen has the potential to be used as a safe radioprotective remedy. Giving mice hydrogen water before radiation increased their survival rates and protected the heart from damage. Hydrogen also increased the survival of white blood cells exposed to radiation . 24). Hydrogen Water May Relieve Pain Hydrogen water was not better than the placebo in one study (DB-RCT) of 30 patients with painful, inflamed bladder (cystitis). It did help reduce pain in 11% of the patients. Drinking hydrogen water could reduce neuropathic pain in mice due to its well-known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Clinical trials would need to confirm this success, but hydrogen water holds promise for safely improving otherwise hard-to-treat neuropathic pain. 25). Hydrogen Water May Increase Longevity The ability of molecular hydrogen to protect the DNA and the mitochondria from oxidative damage may have beneficial effects on chronic diseases and cancer. But perhaps it could help slow down or reverse the aging process itself. A couple of cellular studies give us some interesting clues . It was already discovered that hydrogen can prolong the life of stem cells by reducing oxidative stress . A hydrogen-rich environment reduced both oxidative stress and aging in cells. Some scientists think that drinking hydrogen water could increase longevity in humans. 26). Hydrogen Water May Kill Bacteria and Improve Oral Health Drinking hydrogen water 4-5 X daily improved gum health in 13 patients with inflamed gums after 8 weeks. It also boosted blood antioxidants and enhanced the effects of other gum disease treatments. Hydrogen water could kill the bacteria that most commonly cause gum disease and cavities. It could be used to improve overall oral health. 27). Hydrogen Preserves Transplant Organs Hydrogen water could help preserve and reduce damage to transplant organs without any toxic effects. It reduced the inflammation and injury that usually happens when donated organs are stored, which could help save more lives. Hydrogen water is simply water infused with hydrogen gases. Hydrogen gas acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and has antioxidant activity. These are the features that make it good for you. Links To The Studies Below. Prevention Is The Best Medicine.  HNEX™ was developed by a group of world-renowned European scientists with a patented technology that has been scientifically tested and shown to signal the activation of genetic pathways which can lead to positive impacts to all areas of your health. HNEX™ utilizes Silver Nano Particles as a base to attach a matrix of separate Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms. This delivers Oxygen to the cells and Hydrogen as a gas to the body’s immune systems. HNEX is a Direct Molecular Hydro & Oxygen Distribution Complex Highly potent and effective, this Nano Silver anchor delivery method is Antiviral, Antifungal and Antibacterial throughout its transportational action of vital Oxygen to cells and Hydrogen throughout the body. • Improve immune system health
• Modulate hormone balance to support vitality and wellness
• Help maintain a healthy inflammatory response
• Improve gut health and digestive enzyme production
• Help maintain cardiovascular health and support arterial elasticity HNEX™ is the first supplement on the market that contains active hydro-oxygen Nano structured molecules, providing powerful cellular messengers that help protect, rejuvenate and restore cells. Cell signaling in your body plays a key role in regulating gene expression. We are not talking eye color here — your genes do much more than dictate physical characteristics. Genes give life-sustaining instructions to cells, and cells carry out those instructions to keep you alive and healthy. As we age, cell communication breaks down, the signal weakens, and gene expression can be disrupted. Regulating gene activity with hydro-oxygen molecules keeps cellular
communication strong. Hydrogen gas is the smallest molecule in our universe. Scientific studies have shown hydrogen gas and adequate hydration can support the availability of clean cellular energy which our body requires for the proper function of tissues and organs. Within the body’s tissues and organs, Nano hydrogen is small enough that it can penetrate deep into human cells where our metabolism transforms the food we eat into cellular energy. At this cellular level, hydrogen gas and purified water provide essential metabolic functions that power both our mind and physical performance. The human body naturally receives hydrogen gas from the microbial flora that reside within each of us. These symbiotic microbes produce hydrogen gas as they help our bodies obtain nutrients from the food we eat. The microbial-produced hydrogen gas is then absorbed into our bloodstream where its biological benefits are carried throughout our body until we exhale this gas as we breathe. HNEX™ is an efficient way to directly deliver hydrogen gas into your body. Many of us are unintentionally filling our body with chemicals, toxins and the wrong foods which lower our pH balance. This acidic pH results in oxygen deprivation at the cellular level. This is the beginning of degenerative disease. Normal cells create energy via aerobic (with oxygen) respiration. Alkaline cells are able to absorb sufficient quantities of oxygen to support aerobic respiration. However, when cells become more acidic, less oxygen is absorbed, and the cells begin to ferment glucose in order to survive. This concept is essential to understand, because cancer cells thrive in an acidic, anaerobic environment and don’t do very well in an aerobic, alkaline environment. Disease Prevention Hydrogen water may contain antioxidants. Antioxidants help prevent oxidative stress. This type of stress comes from both normal body functions and external forces, including sun exposure and industrial chemicals. Oxidative stress may lead to cancer and other diseases. These preliminary studies also suggest hydrogen water may be anti-inflammatory, a quality that may reduce the risk of heart disease and other life-threatening diseases. How much HNEX™ should I drink daily? For those with chronic health challenges – Morning – 1/2 oz. (1 Tbsp) concentrate – hold in mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. It is not like oil pulling, where you spit out the oil after holding in your mouth. You swallow the HNEX™, as any bacteria has been eliminated by HNEX™, and it continues working once you swallow. Repeat daily. Daytime – add 1 oz. (2 Tbsp) concentrate to about 20 oz. of filtered water (not distilled water – it is acidic, not juice, not lemon water, etc.) Drink this mixture throughout the day, along with your intake of normal water. Repeat daily. Evening – 1/2 oz. (1 Tbsp) concentrate – hold in mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. Repeat daily. For maintenance: Morning – 1/2 oz. (1 TBSP) of HNEX™ concentrate, hold in the mouth for as long as possible (up to 30 minutes), swallow. (not distilled water – it is acidic, not juice, not lemon water, etc.) Drink this mixture throughout the day, along with your intake of normal water. Repeat daily. NOTE: We recommend taking HNEX™ concentrate at least 30 minutes before or after eating any food, because if you have any fresh fruits or veggies that you haven’t cleaned all the bacteria from, HNEX™ will go to work on that bacteria first before entering the blood stream. This is not a requirement, but rather a suggestion. HNEX™ may help minimize symptoms and reduce the duration of colds, flus and other viruses. In an acute scenario like this, the protocol is different than the standard protocol of 1 or 2 ounces per day. The protocol is to sip the HNEX™ concentrate all day long. Do not dilute the concentrate. You can drink an entire liter in a day or two. This does not replace the fluids needed to support the system’s detoxification process, so continue to also drink as much clean, filtered water as you can. Additionally, consider the action to nebulize the HNEX™ directly into the lungs and spraying the HNEX™ concentrate directly into the sinus pathways using a sinus spray bottle. HNEX™ concentrate can be applied directly to the skin to help with burns, cuts, scraps, rashes, and wound recovery. Simply spray the HNEX™ concentrate directly on the affected area, allowing it to dry naturally. Do this a minimum of 4x per day. It may also be beneficial to place a HNEX™ concentrate saturated cloth or paper towel, sized appropriately, and keep on the affected area. Keep moist by spraying concentrate on the cloth, or even wrap with plastic wrap to retain moisture. HNEX™ can be used with a nebulizer, for direct delivery into the lungs. Spraying HNEX™ in the nose and eyes can be helpful to hydrate these areas, as can adding a drop in the ear canal. HNEX™ may also be used with an enema or douche bag. 12 Years Although the primary targets or exact biochemical mechanisms of hydrogen are still not fully understood, the therapeutic effect in cells, tissues, humans, animals and even agricultural plants is becoming widely accepted due to the now over 500 peer reviewed articles and the 1,600 researchers working on the medical effects of hydrogen. Here are some useful links to peer-reviewed scientific articles on molecular hydrogen, research collaboration and many educational articles on molecular hydrogen.

Chlorine Dioxide: A Universal Antidote With Dr. Andreas Kalcker (Video) ,3003,"
 While Big Pharma pimps their poisons to the ignorant and unsuspecting masses, a natural compound is being used around the world to treat skin diseases, autism, cancers and even the alleged COVID disease. Could it really be possible that Chlorine Dioxide could be a universal antidote? Dr. Andreas Kalcker testifies to the amazing results of Chlorine Dioxide (MMS) in this episode. Andreas Kalcker is a biophysical researcher of German origin who has lived most of his life in Spain and for many years has been living in Switzerland where he has investigated and registered several international patents that deal with the therapeutic use of chlorine dioxide for both hypoxia and for inflammation, infection, sepsis and Sars -Cov 2 -Coronavirus. His thesis and experience later became the basis treated extensively in his first book “CDS health is possible.” Years later the publication of his second book “Forbidden Health” shows us how the recovery of diseases from A to Z considered impossible to cure in the past, obtains a remarkable success, but opens a wide controversy in the world of conventional science of the “Establishment”. The unfair controversy created by some media confused CDS (CLO2) with Bleach or sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) which is another substance and reached such a point that its sale was censored by Amazon without giving explanations despite its excellent reception by part of the public that continues to request that company to return the book to the virtual shelves. The Forum of Forbidden health has more than 60.000 unregistered and 3.000 registered members of the SVNB using CDS successfully without harmful effects falsely claimed by some health agencies; this is a place where you can read and exchange real experiences and questions regarding the use of CDS. Andreas Kalcker maintains after 13 years of research, that his magisterial formula of chlorine in aqueous form or CDS is also the definitive solution for the Coronavirus disease, since it lacks negative side effects, something that has been fully demonstrated in international multicenter clinical trials and by 3000 Doctors of the international organization COMUSAV with a presence in more than 24 countries with more than 20.000 registered in the Forum, and of which Kalcker is also an honorary member and co-founder. There is a bit of an echo in the interview on Dr. Kalcker’s end. I suggest turning the volume a little lower and using headphones to better understand. Articles and videos mentioned in this episode.

The Amazing Health Benefits Of Okra ,3063,"
 EpigeneticsAndNutriton.com is a source for optimal health and wellness! The Origins Of Okra According to history, one of the world’s most beautiful women, Cleopatra of Egypt, ate Okra, also known as “lady finger or gumbo”. It is characterized by its green color, elongated and tapering ridged pods infused with double row of seeds and slimy texture when cut open. This integral member of the cotton family is indigenous to regions around the Nile in North Africa and the Middle East for it was discovered dating as far as 3500 years ago in Ethiopia. Early Egyptians are known to love its taste. Okra later transcended to North America en route slave trade and then to Europe, Asia and South and Central America. During World War II, the shortage of coffee beans made them use the seeds as a substitute for coffee. This incident made the word “okra fever”. Since then, its popularity never disappeared from local markets to convenience stores throughout the world and throughout the year. Okra Nutrition Value
 Besides being low in calories, it is aplenty with vitamins of the category A, Thiamin, B6, C, folic acid, riboflavin, calcium, zinc and dietary fiber. Eating okra is highly recommended for pregnant woman because of its richness in folic acid, which is essential in the neural tube formation of the fetus during 4-12 weeks of gestation period in the mother’s womb. No wonder, Cleopatra was so beautiful! As you can see, okra is an excellent ingredient to include in most dishes, even if it is just as a soup thickener. There are many recipes to optimize okra for its nutritional value.  There are some healthy recipes that can help in the control of the disease of diabetes and even a recipe for okra coffee! I hope that as its impressive nutritional profile becomes better known among cooks and foodies, okra will become a more popular ingredient in Western cuisine.

10 Problems Genetically Modified Foods Are Already Causing ,13349,"
 by Joe Martino Genetically modified foods (GMOs) have been getting a bad rep for years now as studies continue to come out revealing the dangerous nature of GMOs. Whether it be the harm they cause to people eating them, or the environment, many believe GMOs have no place in our world. On the flip side, many state there are no real concerns we have to worry about yet when it comes to human consumption, and in many ways GMOs help to feed the world. The ‘feed the world’ claim has always been refuted by pointing to the amount of food waste that exists as well as the current farming methods available that could feed the world without GMOs. Nonetheless, people are not sold on GMOs and they have good reason. Here are 10 problems genetically modified foods are already causing in our world. No need to keep waiting for the science, it’s already in. 1. They Kill Bees & Butterflies It was a debate before but that debate is now over as a Harvard study confirmed that what is killing the bees in such large numbers is pesticides. Now one could argue that GM crops aren’t the cause of all the deaths as there are other pesticides being sprayed, but Monsanto’s Roundup has been linked to killing off the Monarch Butterflies. In the end, this is just adding to the insane amounts of pesticides that will increase greatly every year as a result of how these crops are being engineered. It’s a problem that will be huge even just a few years down the road. Although some have been suggesting that more food for the world is better than a few bugs dying, the reality is that the bees are a huge part of pollinating our food plants in order for us to even be able to enjoy their fruits. 2. Cross-Pollination Contaminates Regular Crops This could prove to be one of the biggest issues once the rest of North America realizes GMOs shouldn’t be grown any longer and we finally stop producing them. GMO seeds are very tough to contain. Unfortunately they are finding that seeds can travel much farther than initially anticipated (up to several kilometers) and are creating cross-pollination on farms that are not and do not wish to be GMO. Farms that have accidental cross-pollination and are organic could lose their organic status as a result of this. 3. They Create Superbugs & Superweeds It appears great. You design a plant that is already resistant to pests and therefore you can grow food without the bugs tearing away at it. The problem is, in the process you create superweeds and superbugs as well as less nutritious food. What most people don’t realize about GM crop farming is that while farmers may experience a lower need for chemicals in the first few years of growing, it increases greatly as the crops, weeds and pests develop an immunity to the chemicals. Operating costs, pollution levels and herbicides/pesticides on your food increases as well. In 2011, scientists studied 13 major pests and found that five were immune to the poisons genetically bred into GM plants like Bt corn and Bt cotton. On top of that, farmers found that they were regularly battling with superweeds as a result of glyphosate found in RoundUp. According to the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Sciences Europe, GM crops cause herbicide use to increase 25 percent per year. 4. It’s Illegal To Accidentally Grow A GM Plant This is very much coupled with the problem above. When seeds can fly everywhere, there can be a lot of accidental growing – which is still illegal. In a number of cases, seeds found on farmers who were not growing GM crops caused huge court cases in which Monsanto sued these farmers for illegally growing large amounts of seeds they did not buy. Meanwhile the seeds may have blown onto their land, could have come in second generation seed sales without farmers noticing, or could have come from farmers buying cost-effective bags of seeds where sources are unknown. The bottom line is these seeds are hard to track and with something as simple as a seed being illegal to plant, it’s bound to create issues. 5. Farmers Are Not Able To Harvest Seeds Many may not realize but, Monsanto does not allow farmers to use second generation seeds. They must buy new seeds every year which increases the cost for farmers as Monsanto’s “premium seeds” don’t come cheap. This takes many of the fundamentals away from farming. Instead of the typical plant seeds, grow crops, harvest them and harvest the seeds for next year, Monsanto’s you must buy again next year. In the Supreme court case between Bowman v. Monsanto, the 70-year-old farmer was unanimously found guilty of patent infringement for buying second generation Monsanto seeds. It’s another move by Monsanto that illustrates their lack of care for food and people and their clear-cut obsession with control and profit. 6. Little Government Oversight Remember the superbugs and superweeds? The reality is it’s possible this could have all been avoided if farmers were required to go through training for safe GM farming practices. For example, farmers who follow GM guidelines and plant “refuges,” which are not Bt-crops, adjacent to their GM fields, have much lower rates of pest resistance. Many farmers did not follow these strict guidelines which could be contributing to the problems. If the government put in regulations to make sure large farms were planted correctly, this could have been avoided. Maybe the Bollworm problem in India could have been avoided as well considering many believe it has been the cause of the sudden increase. Labeling has been another big argument. 64 countries – including China and the European Union – require labeling of genetically engineered foods. But, the US, the largest producer of GM foods does not have any labeling laws. Considering much of the informed public is steering well clear of consuming GMOs, it appears the US is afraid that if labelling was required, many wouldn’t bother to buy products that were GM and thus it would kill their business. This also illustrates the fact that the public does not want GMOs around and yet the government spends money and makes decisions to produce them without public support. 7. Increased Suicide Rates This is one that we may not be aware of but is actually quite a staggering fact. Many know that farming can be risky, especially in places like India. Farming in India requires a good monsoon season in order to have enough water to keep crops growing well. Since farms hope to keep up with production and are open to trying anything, they have opted to try out Monsanto’s GM seeds. The issue is that they require double the amount of water and there pest-free claims are not always the case. As Bollworms continue to eat their crops and monsoon seasons are weak, farmers struggle to make money and their debt takes over. This is leading them to commit suicide in large numbers. About 1000 per month or so are taking their lives. A New York Times article concluded that the extremely high prices of GM seeds and pesticides are causing farmers to make less money than ever. India’s Agricultural Ministry believes that Monsanto is partly to blame for the increased suicide rates (125,000 since GM inception.) In 2012, a panel of scientists commissioned by India’s Supreme Court recommended a 10-year moratorium on field trials for all GM crops until further testing was done and stricter regulations created. 8. GMOs Harm Biodiversity Biological diversity, or biodiversity, is all about having a variety of lifeforms in various regions on earth. It is part of a delicate balance nature maintains and each aspect of biodiversity plays a key role in the circle of life. Unfortunately, agribusiness is putting a huge damper on biodiversity due to its obsession with monoculture farming. Monoculture farming is when land is cleared of all of its native plants and instead a single crop is grown. This is especially bad with GM foods because not only are farmers only growing one crop, but the plants themselves are all genetically the same and from the same source. No diversity whatsoever. This makes our food all very susceptible to changes in climate, pests and disease. Not only are we eating GM foods that are harming health and plant species, but we are also cutting out insects like bees and butterflies which will have an impact on not only other plants but other areas of the food chain. To continue down the wildlife path, herbicides are known to cause birth defects and population declines in amphibians, birds, soil organisms and marine ecosystems. Monsanto is a business and they do not seem to be putting the earth, people and biodiversity ahead of their own profits. By buying up seed farms everywhere, removing tried and tested seeds and replacing them with higher-priced GM seeds, they are killing biodiversity and gaining ownership over nature. Some argue that Monsanto is helping to fix the world’s food supply, but there is nothing to back that up at this point. Instead, it appears as though they are putting food at risk. 9. Corruption: The Revolving Door Between Government & Biotech Workers The fact is, there has been a large amount of ridicule pushed towards GMOs touting their lack of safety. But these companies respond time and time again that they are perfectly safe and seem to have studies in hand to prove it. But on the other side of the coin there are a plethora of studies to prove their lack of safety as well. Regardless of all the contradictory information out there, it would be fair for anyone on an unbiased playing field to feel suspicious over the fact that the former vice president of Monsanto, Michael Taylor, is now the Deputy Commissioner at the United States Food and Drug Administration. This also isn’t the first time Taylor has held positions at the USDA. He has been criticized a great deal for being in the “revolving door” of the public and private sector. Conspiracy or not, is it not odd that he took the position? Was he doing so for his love and passion for food and safety? Or was he placed there to help protect his agribusiness friends? This wouldn’t be the first time the FDA has been caught performing corrupt actions. Things get even more sticky when you consider that, back in the ’90s, FDA scientists warned that gene-sliced foods were significantly different and could lead to “different risks” as compared to conventional foods. Interestingly these findings were never added to official policy released. 10. Distract from Healthy, Environmentally Friendly Technologies Monsanto is trying to convince the world that the future of food is lab designed versus the proven methods of natural growing. When you take into account aquaculture food production where food grows in the plenty and is supported by other aspects of nature, we can quickly see that we can grow enough food for the world. Although Monsanto is trying to make a case for GM foods being the answer to world hunger, most places that would need it don’t even want to eat GM foods. This pretty much says it all: 24 delegates from 18 African countries told the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, “We strongly object that the image of the poor and hungry from our countries is being used by giant multinational corporations to push a technology that is neither safe, environmentally friendly nor economically beneficial to us. We do not believe that such companies or gene technologies will help our farmers to produce the food that is needed in the 21st century. On the contrary, we think it will destroy the diversity, the local knowledge and the sustainable agricultural systems that our farmers have developed for millennia, and that it will thus undermine our capacity to feed ourselves.” What are the answers for alleviating world hunger? To begin with, government subsidies used to grow GM crops could be used to grow good organic foods in eco-friendly ways. These foods could be supplied to the local public or if need be shipped to countries at lower costs (due to subsidies) in order for them to have food. This model would encourage countries to help each other out as opposed to simply competing with one another. There are also a number of crops that currently grow well in harsh areas such as pearl millet, fonio and African rice. We could also use creative tactics like grocery store rooftop gardens so produce can be grown local. Encourage greenhouses so foods that cannot grow year round can be grown and sold locally. Urban farming can take off and people would grow food in their own backyards. There are a number of ways we can bring real, local food back to our tables and to the tables of those who are in need. What You Can Do Plain a simple, vote with your dollar. When you spend money on GM foods or foods that contain GMOs you are sending the message that you support it. Instead buy organic foods or support local organic farmers. You can also begin growing your own food. This information can also be spread to people so they become aware of the issues. The more we know, the more we can take action to make things change. Sources listed throughout the article.

CBD Oil Benefits That People Are Thankful For ,3176,"
 CBD oil is usually extracted from the cannabis plant and diluted with hauler oil like hemp seed or coconut oil. By the use of these oils, you will automatically have relief from any pain you might have. CBD oil is gaining a global recognition in the health and wellness industry. Scientific studies have proved that it may reduce symptoms of chronic pain as well as anxiety. In this article, we will discuss several health benefits of CBD that will amaze you. Since 2900 BC, marijuana has been used to treat pains which scientists have discovered. The human body has a particular system known as the endocannabinoid system (ECS). They are usually involved in regulating a variety of functions that include appetite, pain, sleep, and immune system reaction. Are you suffering from arthritis? A combination of CBD and THC is known to be effective in treating arthritis-related pains. Have you been searching for a mental health disorder in vain? Don’t worry! Anxiety and depression are usually common symptoms of mental health disorders and can bring distressing impacts on well-being and health. Research done by the World Health Organization (WHO), shows that depression is one of the single contributors to disability worldwide. While on the other hand, anxiety disorder is ranked as the top six in the entire world. CBD oil from Joy Organics has brought promising help for both anxieties and depression that have led to more comfortable lives for those living with disorders, giving it tremendous interest in the natural approach. Cancer has been a comprehensive threat worldwide, but CBD is termed to help symptoms related to cancer disease. It reduces cancer side effects treatments like vomiting, nausea as well as pains. A study done proved that CBD and THC were administered to 177 people with cancer-like pains. The CBD ones experienced a remarkable reduction of pain than THC ones, and this was amazing. CBD also reduces nausea and vomiting for chemotherapy-induced patients. More sources show that it may have cancer-fighting components; research is still underway to prove its safety and efficiency. What is acne? This is usually a common skin disease condition that affects a particular percentage population. The causes of this skin disease condition are genetic, bacteria, and inflammation, and not to forget any overproduction of sebum. According to research done, CBD oil may help in the treatment of acne by its inflammatory properties and possess the ability to reduce sebum production in the body. Currently, research has been done and linked CBD with other quality benefits for heart health and the circulatory system, which include excellent ability to lower high blood pressure in your body in a significant way. High blood pressure usually has several risks like stroke, metabolic syndrome, and heart attack. This risk has affected many lives causing thousands of deaths within a short duration of time. CBD has several benefits, and research done on several websites like Joy Organics has provided safe, excellent natural treatment for several health diseases. In days to come, many more benefits will automatically shock many and save lots of lives."
Dr. Zelenko Warns 75% of Vaxxed Could Be Dead in 3 Years ,844,"
 IT’S GENOCIDE Dr. Vladimir Zelenko quotes a prediction from Dr. Mike Yeadon that 75% of those who receive the mRNA vaccine(s) could be dead in 3 years. On the brighter side he offers methods to prevent death with mitigation strategies that include affordable anti-viral medications that do not require a doctor’s prescription. ________________________________________________________________________________________ Related Articles: COVID-19 & COVID-19 Shot Therapy – They Don’t Want You to Find – Full Article   Fountain of Youth: Now You Can Turn Back the Clock Hydrogen Water & Ionized Water w/Silver Particles, Research for You Immune System – 2021 the Year of Alternative Medicine.

US GOVERNMENT BEHIND EBOLA OUTBREAK? EVIDENCE OF FALSE FLAG ATTACK ,5626,"

 *US bioweapons lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation at core of Ebola epidemic *CDC admits hospitals and vaccines cause Ebola *Epidemic and pandemic plans allow for implementation of martial law Local people in West Africa appear to know without having to read the CDC Ebola fact sheet that hospitals and medical staff are spreading Ebola. The Telegraph reports people wielding knives surrounded a Red Cross vehicle in Guinea. The involvement of hospitals would also explain why Ebola has appeared in this part of Africa for the first time ever and in so many different locations at almost the same time. Given that the CDC itself admits that hospitals are, in fact, the likely source of any Ebola outbreak, the question arises which specific hospital could be the origin of the current Ebola outbreak? At the epicentre of the current Ebola epidemic is the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which houses a US a biosecurity level 2 bioweapons research lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Soros Foundation. The partners and people leading the viral fever bioweapons lab inside Kenema Government Hospital read like a roll call of New World Order organizations. “”The Consortium is a collaboration between Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute, Harvard University, University of California at San Diego, University of Texas Medical Branch, Autoimmune Technologies LLC, Corgenix Medical Corporation, Kenema Government Hospital (Sierra Leone), Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) and various other partners in West Africa. …The Consortium intends to expand this program to include other important infectious agents such as Ebola, Marburg and other Arenaviruses that are of great concern to public health and bioterrorism,” states the bioweapons lab website. The website admits that Professor Robert F. Garry is ” currently managing the consortium of scientists who are developing modern diagnostics for several biodefense pathogens.” http://vhfc.org/consortium/people/garry Dr James E. Robinson ” is a collaborating investigator in four large consortia projects funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.” http://vhfc.org/consortium/people/robinson Dr Pardis Sabeti has received fellowships from the Rhodes Scholarship, the Soros Fellowship, L’Oreal For Women in Science Fellowship, according to the website. EBOLA OUTBREAK AND US BIO – WEAPONS  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr-3Zu8gmTU  *US government-funded Ebola trial on humans linked to Ebola outbreak *WHO establishes “Sub regional control centre in West Africa”   The US Department of Defense (DoD) funded an Ebola trial on humans which started just weeks before the Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Sierra Leone, it has emerged. http://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/tekmira-doses-first-subject-human-clinical-trial-tkm-ebola-16415.html The DoD gave a contract worth $140 million dollars to Tekmira, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, to conduct Ebola research, which apparently involved injecting and infusing healthy humans with the deadly Ebola virus. The DoD is listed as a collaborator in a “First in Human” Ebola clinical trial (NCT02041715, which started in January 2014 shortly before an Ebola epidemic was declared in West Africa in March. http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02041715 http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02041715?displayxml=true Disturbingly, the US government has an viral fever bioterrorism research laboratory in Kenema,  a town at the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. http://vhfc.org/consortium/partners/kgh There has been speculation as to whether a mysterious 5th cohort added to the Tekmira clinical trial was linked to the outbreak in Guinea. “Also odd is that according to the old ICON link they added a 5th cohort to the single-ascending dose part. Only 4 had been planned. I initially thought that maybe due to a good safety profile they wanted to test an even higher dose than the top dose originally planned…In retrospect, has this been an emergency cohort they wanted tested before sending over the supplies to Guinea,” writes a blogger on March 30th. http://rnaitherapeutics.blogspot.gr/2014/03/as-ebola-spreads-fear-in-western-africa.html It cannot be ruled out this “fifth cohort” were people infected in the US bioterrorism laboratory in Sierra Leone in order to start a pandemic.

6 Medicinal Properties of Hibiscus ,15502,"
 Hibiscus, in the form of a delicious tea and as an ancient medicinal therapy extracted from various parts of the plant, is a powerful booster for your health. Healthy benefits of adding hibiscus to your medicinal and nutritional choices include balancing lipid profiles for both types of diabetes, reducing obesity and tummy fat, lowering blood pressure, attacking inflammation, decreasing oxidative stress and reversing metabolic syndrome. The forms of hibiscus range from tea and syrups to extracts and oils. 1. Helps Diabetes In a Type 1 diabetes-induced rat model, hibiscus extract of 1.75 grams per kilograms by weight was used as treatment — decreasing degeneration and necrotic changes found in pancreatic cells, showing the antidiabetic mechanism of hibiscus.[i] Data from an alloxan-induced Type 1 diabetic rat study demonstrated that hibiscus extract possesses strong hypolipidemic as well as antioxidant properties and could prevent atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular pathologies associated with Type 1 diabetes.[ii] In a trial of 60 Type 2 diabetes patients, participants consumed either hibiscus tea or black tea two times a day for one month. Those in the hibiscus tea group increased their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and significantly decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (Apo-B100) deficiency (overall positive effects on their blood lipid profile) compared to the control group.[iii] 2. Reduces Obesity and Abdominal Fat Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or greater between the ages of 18 and 65 years were randomly divided into 17 control and 19 hibiscus extract treated groups for 12 weeks. Consumption of the hibiscus extract reduced obesity, abdominal fat and serum free fatty acid, improved liver steatosis and could help to prevent obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.[iv] Both hibiscus and lemon verbena extracts were used with 54 overweight subjects and effectively helped to manage their weight as measured by energy expenditure, appetite control and lipid profile.[v] 3. Lowers Blood Pressure Five studies with 390 participants were meta-analyzed for effects of hibiscus supplements with significant results for lowering both systolic blood pressure (by an average of nearly eight millimeters of mercury (mmHg)) and diastolic blood pressure (by four mmHg).[vi] A total of 46 stage 1 high blood pressure (systolic from 130 to 139; diastolic from 80 to 89) patients participated in a control study given lifestyle and dietary advice while the treatment group added two cups of hibiscus tea every morning for a month. Both the control and treatment groups reduced systolic blood pressure but the mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the group drinking hibiscus tea.[vii] A total of 80 subjects with stage 1 high blood pressure of both sexes were studied and treated either with placebo or a hibiscus extract over 84 days. The results showed the hibiscus extract significantly reduced the daytime systolic blood pressure and variation throughout the day compared to the control group.[viii] 4. Fights Inflammation Hibiscus has both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In an in vitro study, hibiscus was found to decrease the inflammasome (which puts into motion inflammatory responses to infections and cell damage) nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3). NLRP3 is associated with several human disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune encephalitis[ix] and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, infectious cardiac diseases and heart failure.[x] In a review of research articles on hibiscus and chronic diseases, scientific evidence shows the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms by which hibiscus improves high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease.[xi] 5. Reduces Oxidative Stress An extensive research review shows hibiscus is effective in curing various degenerative diseases like high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, cancer and other inflammatory liver and kidney diseases. Most studies supported the scientific evidence that hibiscus can help prevent chronic and degenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral slerosis (ALS), and cancers.[xii],[xiii] These diseases are characterized by extensive oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA.[xiv] A review of in vitro and in vivo studies on hibiscus showed the significant therapeutic properties of the extracts and phytochemicals derived from hibiscus sabdariffa as antimicrobial, anti-parasitic and anticancer agents without the undesirable side effects, toxicity and drug resistance of current treatments.[xv] Cell cycle regulation is an important issue in cancer therapy and hibiscus extract arrested cell cycle activity in human leukemia cell lines, indicating that this compound could be a promising anticancer agent.[xvi] 6. Reverses Metabolic Syndrome Insulin resistance, obesity, high blood pressure and imbalanced lipids are strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, which is considered to be a reversible clinical stage before its evolution to coronary heart disease and diabetes. A total daily dose of 100 milligrams (mg) of hibiscus extract powder was orally administered in capsules for one month and compared with a cholesterol balancing diet. The metabolic syndrome patients treated with hibiscus extract had significantly reduced glucose and total cholesterol levels, increased HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) levels, and an improved TAG/HDL-c ratio, a marker of insulin resistance. Additionally, a triglyceride-lowering effect was observed in metabolic syndrome patients treated with hibiscus plus diet and in individuals without metabolic syndrome treated with hibiscus alone.[xvii] Forms of Hibiscus Hibiscus comes in the form of dried flowers, powder, tea or extract capsules (250 to 400 mg doses) as well as oil. The dried flowers or powders (1.5 teaspoons) can be steeped in 3/4 cup of hot water to make tea but should be USDA organic and limited to three times a day.[xviii] Further boiling reduces the tea to a syrup. The hibiscus plant can be used as a natural colorant for food and capsule extracts from dried flowers show bioactive compounds that are antioxidant, antimicrobial, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, antibacterial and antifungal.[xix] Anthocyanins from the petals of the hibiscus plant are believed to stop inflammatory processes in the body.[xx] A study of rats showed hibiscus, in the form of the oil extracted from the roselle seed, balanced lipids and cholesterol[xxi] and served as a good source of lipid-soluble antioxidants.[xxii] From in vivo and in vitro studies, the leaf extract of hibiscus exhibited more potency on hair growth compared to the flower extract.[xxiii] Hibiscus’ bright red calyces are nutrient dense and used in jams and juices for coloring and its leaves and young shoots are fiber-rich superfoods that can be used in cooking, such as in curries, soups, stews and stir-fries, or eaten raw in salads, offering many nutritional benefits.[xxiv] Strong Health Protections of Hibiscus Enjoy hibiscus’ medicinal properties as antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, lipid and cholesterol balancers and antibacterial — by consuming its flavorful tea or adding other parts of the flowering plant such as leaves, calyces and seed oils to your healthy habits. Using hibiscus as a therapy may also help to reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular and degenerative chronic diseases.

Pfizer’s COVID injections trigger “mysterious” side effects ,5636,"
 (NaturalHealth365) According to the latest statistics, just under 30 percent of the United States population (or about 94.8 million people) have now received their full doses of the experimental COVID injections, including the Pfizer COVID shot.  Yet as mainstream media, social media influencers, and even private companies continue to try to get people to line up for the jab, concerning reports of post-shot paralysis and other health problems continue to trickle into the headlines. These health problems (those that are being reported, at least) must be thoroughly investigated before we can know for sure what’s causing them.  But they inspire some important questions.  For instance: millions of Americans are skipping their second Pfizer or Moderna shots – could this have anything to do with the understandable concerns over this experimental drug, instead of just “misinformation” or scheduling conflicts as some media outlets will claim?  Could the fact that there’s more supply than “demand” for these drugs have anything to do with the alarming reports of adverse events?  And is the so-called “hesitancy” over these experimental drugs really all that hard to believe, given what we hear about these injections? News outlets scramble to do damage control in response to reports of paralysis, stroke, shingles occurring within hours of COVID shot Right now, millions of doses of Pfizer and Moderna shots have already been administered to people throughout the world.  In the United States, the COVID shot from Johnson and Johnson should also be back in syringes soon, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lifted a short-lived pause on the drug.  But to the chagrin of pharmaceutical companies and public health officials, the rollout of these experimental drugs has been marred by concerning reports of serious and, in some cases, deadly health problems occurring in previously well, newly-jabbed people. According to reports shared by Children’s Health Defense, one 33-year-old woman in Pennsylvania reportedly woke up paralyzed from the neck down on the morning after getting shot with Pfizer.  Another 43-year-old man from Mississippi suffered a stroke just hours after getting his J&J shot.  And in what critics say is a bold example of gaslighting, the medical examiners investigating the tragic death of a doctor in Florida concluded that the healthy man died of “natural causes” following his Pfizer shot and that a link to the shot is unknown. Back in January, the healthy 56-year-old Miami Beach doctor, Dr. Gregory Michael, famously fell ill with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) after getting his first Pfizer shot; he died two weeks later.  ITP is a blood disorder in which the immune system attacks a person’s own platelets.  Thrombocytopenia was also experienced by the young women who received a J&J shot (in addition to blood clots) which prompted the experimental drug’s temporary ban. Another recent study published in Rheumatology found that an outbreak of shingles (herpes zoster infection) occurred in 1.2% of patients within 14 days of their first or second Pfizer shot.  The risk of shingles appeared greater among people with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Shingles is a painful and sometimes dangerous skin rash that occurs when the virus that causes chickenpox becomes reactivated after staying dormant for years within the brain and spinal nerves.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shingles is incredibly common and will affect about one-third of the U.S. population.  However, the fact that these outbreaks occurred so soon after the COVID shots prompted the authors of the study to note that “studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 [injections] in patients with [autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases] are needed” and that currently, the safety of such drugs is “unknown.” In case you were wondering, here are known health problems linked to already-existing, FDA-approved shots Most media reports on these post-shot adverse effects are VERY quick to downplay them, saying there is no proven link between the health problems and the jabs.  But while we need further investigation of all these reports, we do think it’s worthwhile to remember that plenty of other shots — all of which are actually FDA-approved — are known to cause tremendously harmful effects in some people. For example, here are just a few of the adverse events associated with the seasonal flu shot, Fluzone Quadrivalent, according to the drug’s packet insert: Now, even in the package insert itself, the FDA appears to downplay these reactions by stating, “it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.”  Yet later on in the exact same paragraph, the FDA says that they included these adverse effects in the packet insert “based on one or more of the following factors: severity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship.” The bottom line: it’s not unreasonable to raise questions about adverse drug events occurring after COVID shots.  After all, we see adverse drug events from other shots, too.  So, why are COVID shot victims, medical professionals, and others being so quickly silenced?

How To Boost Your A.M. Brain Power ,5156,"
 NEW! Follow my Twitter feed… Please like my Facebook page and share your experiences of the spirit and paranormal. The ancients developed mantras designed to focus the mind and to tune thoughts to the vibration of the universe. Today, various forms of meditation also seek to enlighten the mind through greater awareness of the visible and invisible realities that surround us all. NEW! Follow my Twitter feed… Please like my Facebook page and share your experiences of the spirit and paranormal. Science catches up with the ‘Masters of the Mind’ Although physiologists and neurologists don’t admit it, many of the morning routines they advocate designed to increase brain power and shake off the lethargy of sleep are really many of the things that sages, wise men and even ancient spiritualists of the East advised long ago. These positive brain-chargers will work wherever you are: at home, on vacation, even while traveling on business. ‘Brain-mind’ [Andrew Mason, Flickr] Activities that boost your ‘morning brain’ Want to start energizing your brain right away? Here are some of the major things you can do that are proven to work: Sleep your way to a better brain Sleep specialists are alarmed. Many have been ringing the warning bell for decades; few pay heed. Sleep in an integral part of health. Lack of proper, restful sleep, especially if chronic, affects every part of your life. Sleep deprivation affects moods, temperament, emotional stability, the heart, digestion, weight, stamina…and yes, the brain. Getting a good night’s sleep every night is something modern health experts urge and ancient health masters always advised. Boost brain process with morning juice What’s better than coffe in the morning? A serving of pure, sweet juice. Citric juices such as orange, tangerine, lime, and even lemonade, help energize the brain. Eating a grapefruit with breakfast also helps the brain power-up. Coffee, however, is not all bad. A big mug of Java electrifies the brain. Studies have proven that moderate coffee drinking stimulates the brain’s processing of information and speeds up its physiological functions. Be careful, though, for too much coffee can overstimulate, cause stress and symptoms of anxiety to surface later in the day. Morning self-massage Upon waking, don’t jump out of bed and start rushing about. Instead, spend a few minutes deep breathing. Inhale slowly through the nose and exhale slowly through the mouth. This is a regimen recognized for many centuries among the phycisians of the East to assist the body’s elimination of toxins in the bloodstream that can accumulate during the sleeping hours. While deep-breathing and de-toxifying gently massage yourself. This stimulates the muscles, increase blood flow and also helps boost the brain’s activity. Eat a big breakfast For many years health professionals (even some doctors) strongly advise eating a big breakfast. Breakfast is ‘breaking the fast’ your body has endured for as much as 10 to 12 hours. Boostng the brain requires fuel, and those that skip breakfast in lieu of a cup of coffee, a soda, or nothing at all will eventually have morning brain sluggishness. There’s no way to avoid it. An old adage goes: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper.” It’s true and makes much sense. Following that regimen increases physical stamina and promotes overall health, including the health and functioning of your brain. Add high-tech stimuli Blogger Drew in 4 Mind 4 Life advises many of the morning rituals that the ancient Chinese taught thousands of years ago. But Drew also adds an interesting 21st Century twist: technologically boosting the mind. Programs are available that augment the brain and sharpen the brainwave activity. He writes: “Entraining your brain waves is a phenomenal way to amp up your brain power each morning. Any session in the mid-beta to high-beta brain wave range will do a great job at getting you mentally prepared for the day. You will likely feel a huge energy boost after listening! I personally use Neuro-Programmer 2 Professional and Mind Stereo and they can turn my morning into a miracle.” Eat brain-boosting foods The Health Journal provides a list of the top 10 brain foods. Adding them to your diet will automatically boost your brain all day long, including the morning hours. The Journal also adds that the foods will improve your “memory, mood, concentration, and overall clarity.” The list includes many favorites such as blueberries, salmon, nuts, and chocolate. For the entire list and how these foods work go here. A successful life depends on the functioning of your brain. We all live in a competitive world, a world where our ideas compete, our desires, our goals, and our emotions. Boosting your brain and energizing your clarity of thought gives you a big advantage over most people who have no idea how to go about improving their brain or why it makes sense to do so. Brain power increases the likelihood you will achieve success in almost everything you do. NEW!

"Dr. Jerry Tennant, M D ~ Voltage Is the Key to Health! How to Cure Anything! Part 1 of 2 ",23961,"

 “The key to making chronic disease better is making a single cell work. If you give the body the things a single cell needs to work, the body often has the power to heal all of the cells of the body. That means you get well!” In the mid-1990s Dr. Jerry Tennant was one of the top three ophthalmic surgeons in the world. Then, in a matter of months, his career was ended by a mystery ailment that left him disabled and barely clinging to life.
A pioneer in lasik surgery, Dr. Tennant was responsible for most of the research done on the excimer laser for VISX. He also performed over 1,000 lasik operations in the United States and about 2,000 cases abroad. These surgeries actually contributed to his decline in health. In the early days of lasik operations, it was believed that ordinary surgical masks were sufficient to protect doctors from contamination. Nobody suspected that viruses existing in a patient’s eyes could possibly harm the surgeon. But each time Dr. Tennant performed a lasik procedure on a patient, the laser would strike the eye and release viruses that drifted upward through his mask and into his nose and brain. In time he developed encephalitis and a bleeding disorder that manifested as spastic movements and
an inability to remember even how to write a prescription. Diagnostic tests confirmed he had three viruses in his brain, but no one knew how to treat them. Dr. Tennant’s physicians told him there was nothing that could be done to help him. So, on November 30, 1995, he was forced to retire.
He spent almost seven years in a fog that rarely lifted. Too fatigued to function on any level, Dr. Tennant slept about 16 hours each day. During the two to three hours per day when he could think, he read books or newspapers until, like a light switch, his brain would turn off and he would no longer be able to understand what he was reading.
With his waking/thinking time severely limited, Dr. Tennant gradually began to realize that if he was going to get well, it was up to him to find a way since modern American medicine had no answers. So he started reading cellular biology books. As his knowledge grew, so did his belief in the importance of learning how to get a single cell to work correctly. If he could do that, in time, all of his cells would work correctly.
Each of the cellular biology books he read gave passing reference to the fact that cells function in a narrow range of pH, but said little more. Dr. Tennant began to look closely at pH. He came to realize that in addition to acidity and alkalinity, pH measures the voltage in a solution. Voltage. Could this be the key he was searching for? Gradually, Dr. Tennant began to understand that cells must have enough voltage to work and that chronic disease is associated with loss of voltage. His next step was to find out how to
 measure the voltage and keep it at optimal levels. Following this path, he was finally able to heal himself.
This booklet outlines some of Dr. Tennant’s most important discoveries about rebuilding and maintaining good health. Dr. Tennant’s Principles How Do Healthy Cells Work?
Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells. While they are all specialized according to the work they do, they all have the same basic structures. On the outside is a flexible membrane that encloses and protects the cell’s contents. It also regulates what moves into and out of the cell and maintains the cell’s electric potential, which is essential to its ability to do the work required. Inside the cell are at least one nucleus and some cytoplasm, a jellylike substance that consists mostly of water and dissolved proteins. The nucleus acts as a control center for the cell, while the cytoplasm is home to many different structures called organelles (little organs). Each of the organelles plays a different role. The ones we are most concerned with are the mitochondria, which function as the power stations of the cell. The number of mitochondria varies for different types of cells, but under optimal circumstances up to hundreds of mitochondria can exist in a single cell. Because cells need energy for everything they do, the importance of mitochondria cannot be overemphasized. Cell Membranes, Mitochondria: Capacitors and Rechargeable Batteries
Cell membranes are made up of opposing pairs of phospholipids, a specialized type of fat, and loose proteins. Each phospholipid molecule has a ball on one end that works as an electron conductor and two legs that work as electron insulators. These conductors and insulators form a capacitor whose purpose is to store electrons. In effect, the membrane
functions as a small battery that stores voltage for the cell.
All of the energy generated for the use of a cell occurs within the mitochondria via a type of rechargeable battery system known as
ATP/ADP. ATP exists when the battery is charged and ready for work. As energy is spent, the battery becomes ADP. Recharging takes place as electrons are brought in from the cell membrane and mixed with a small amount of phosphorus. This process takes place approximately 70 times per day in every cell in the body. If the ATP/ADP system is not functioning properly, cells cannot generate the power they need to keep the body working. In addition, when the number of mitochondria that are supposed to be functioning in a cell is reduced for any reason, the cell’s ability to provide for its own energy needs is diminished. The body moves electrons into cells 3 ways:
Ionically through the circulatory system
Through the fibrous sheath surrounding the nerves
Through the acupuncture (fascial) system Energize Your Healing Process
Chronic disease is associated with a lack of cellular energy. This is one of the key reasons why traditional Western medicine has been unsuccessful in finding cures for so many of today’s most common health problems. Pharmaceuticals help only in alleviating some of the symptoms, not in providing genuine long-term cures. In fact, bad reactions to pharmaceuticals are the leading cause of death in the U.S. All drugs have side effects that range anywhere from annoying to life-threat-ening—just listen to some of the drug advertise-ments on television if you want to confirm this.
Physicians have always known that, given time and the right conditions, the body has the ability to cure itself of many—if not, most—diseases. A healthy
diet, exercise, and adequate rest go a long way toward curing many problems. But once a chronic disease has established itself, these basic things may not be enough. The body may need to increase the amount of energy in its cells so the cells can do the work they were designed to do. With adequate energy, the effects of a healthy diet, exercise, and rest
are magnified throughout the body.
So how do we increase the amount of energy available to our cells? We have already given a brief overview of the way power or energy works in a cell.
Now let’s take a look at the conditions that enable our “batteries” to work at higher levels of efficiency. Electrons can be obtained from many sources, including:
The Tennant
Biomodulator®
Unprocessed foods
Green leafy vegetables
Alkaline water
Dark chocolate
Sunshine
Working or standing in soil
Fresh air, wind, etc.
Taking advantage of these resources helps your body to create a pool of electrons. Put the Power of pH To Work for You
Because the human body is 75% water, solutions are always in play in our bodies. In fact, much of the transfer of voltage occurs ionically or via fluids. It is important to realize that fluid solutions can either carry additional electrons, making them electron donors, or remove electrons, making them electron stealers.
Remember, electrons are necessary for cells to perform their work. Removing electrons is counterproductive. In fact, free radicals are molecules that are missing electrons and looking to steal
them from other molecules. This makes them unstable and dangerous.
Free radicals create cellular chaos that can lead to a vast array of problems.
On the other hand, antioxidants are electron donors. That’s why
antioxidant foods are so important for good health. When a mother tells her
children to eat their broccoli, she is actually telling them to consume
antioxidants or electron donors.
We can learn whether a solution is an electron donor or an electron stealer by measuring its pH. If a solution is alkaline, it is an electron donor. If it is
acidic, it is an electron stealer. The pH scale measures how acidic or alkaline a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being considered neutral. As you move down the scale from 7, you get a solution that is increasingly acidic (6 is acidic, 5 is even more acidic, etc.). Moving up the scale from 8 to 14 represents increasing alkalinity (8 is alkaline, 9 is more alkaline than 8, etc.). Science has long known that healthy people have an alkaline pH and that, in fact, the human body operates best when the pH is
approximately 7.2 to 7.35. Chronic disease and pain are almost always
associated with an acidic pH. In addition to acidity and alkalinity, pH also refers to voltage, but the scale in this case ranges from –400 to +400 millivolts, with 0 in the middle. Moving down the scale from 0 into the negative range indicates increasing levels of health, while moving up the scale into the positive range indicates increasing dysfunction. Healthy adults normally measure –20 millivolts (mv) of energy, which translates to a pH of 7.35. Children, young adults,
and athletes commonly measure –30 mv of energy. Problems occur when a body’s voltage drops below the necessary operating level of –20 mv. Thus, at -15 mv, a person is tired. At -10 mv, he/she is sick. At -5 mv organs are no longer able to function properly.
Problems resulting from continued drops in voltage include chronic pain, a decrease in oxygen levels, and infections. (Note: Infections continue to increase damage by feeding on healthy cells.) Remember, moving up this scale into the positive range increases vulnerability to illness. At +30 mv, the cellular electrical system malfunctions, reversing cellular polarity (the way electricity is conducted through cells). Damage also occurs to DNA, and cancer is able to gain a foothold in the body and grow. Oxygen and Voltage
Without oxygen, the body—and all of its cells—can’t work. As oxygen levels
decrease, so does health. In 1966 Otto Warburg, one of the twentieth century’s leading cell biologists, received a Nobel Prize for discovering that cancer cannot grow when normal oxygen levels are
present.
The amount of oxygen in cells is determined by voltage. If a cell has
adequate voltage, it will also have adequate oxygen. If cellular voltage is
low, the amount of oxygen in the tissues will be low. This applies to metabolism as well. When voltage and oxygen are low, metabolism becomes anaerobic, which means that oxygen is unavailable.
Anaerobic metabolism is very inefficient.
The Bohr Effect and Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatments
The Bohr Effect states that the amount of oxygen that will dissolve in a solution is dictated by the amount of voltage in the solution. Remember, the human body is 75 percent water, which means this is a key fact for health. As voltage drops, less oxygen can be dissolved into cells. In some cases, hyperbaric oxygen treatments are used to increase oxygen levels in tissues. As oxygen levels rise, so does voltage. When voltage is normal, oxygen can enter cells automatically as needed. Why Do Cells Lose ATP/ADP Power?
The most common reasons for a loss of ATP/ADP power include the cell membrane losing its ability to store electrons and/or a depletion of the number of functioning mitochondria. These conditions can be brought about by:
1. Consuming trans or “plastic” fats, which destroy the cell membrane
2. Hypothyroidism, which reduces the number of mitochondria in cells
3. Heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium
4. Dental infections from decay in teeth, root canals, and in jaw bones
5. Toxins 1. Trans Fats: Dangerous Plastics That Destroy Health
Many years ago food manufacturers recognized that they were losing significant profits because their products were spoiling. In response, they did two things: They added chemicals to foods to keep them from spoiling, and they began to cook fats for long periods of time to stabilize them. The chemicals, we now know, are problematic for the health of the person consuming them. The fats are, too, because the very long cooking
process changes them from a healthy substance into something that is only one carbon atom away from plastic, and that has a profound influence on the structure of cell membranes.
It works like this. When a cell wears out, your body makes a new one. First it looks around to see what building materials are available to make the new cell. If all you have given your body is “plastic” fat (partially hydrogenated or trans fats), the new cell membrane will be made from plastic. The result is sort of like wrapping individual cells in cellophane. A healthy cell membrane is designed to allow certain things to go into and
out of the cell. It can’t function properly when the membrane is made of cellophane. Imagine that one of your cells sends a message to your brain telling it that it is hungry. Your body will respond by sending the cell some glucose and insulin.
What happens when the glucose can’t get through the cellophane?
The cell keeps on complaining that it’s hungry, and your body keeps on sending it more insulin and glucose. Much of the insulin and glucose will be put into fat cells. But the original cell will continue to complain that it is
hungry, and your brain will continue to make you want to eat so that you can try to resolve the hunger issues (see “Beware of MSG” on page 8 for additional information on hunger). Even so, very little glucose will get
through the cellophane into your cells.
In time you will become obese and your pancreas will wear out
from making so much insulin.
With all that glucose in your bloodstream, you will be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Drugs can be prescribed to lower the levels of sugar in your bloodstream, but your cells will still be coping with the effects of being made out of plastic.
Eventually they will begin to wear out and you will get symptoms of worn out cells: heart attacks, strokes, liver failure, kidney failure, blindness,
chronic fatigue, etc.
Obviously, if you want to get well you must stop consuming plastic fats. In today’s world this is easier said than done. Even if you change the fats you use at home, most restaurants use plastic fats for frying foods. If you eat out, you must stop eating fried foods or choose a restaurant that you know doesn’t use plastic fats. Most cheese is also made from plastic fats, which means that avoiding cheeseburgers and French fries is a must. Overall, it’s
safe to say that fast food isn’t dangerous for your health because it is fast—it’s dangerous because it is plastic.
If you continue to feed your body plastic fats, you will never get well. But if you give your body good fats along with the other things it needs, your body will thank you by becoming vibrant and healthy.
Examples of good fats include avocados, raw nuts, safflower oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, borage oil, corn oil, coconut oil, etc. In general, good fats are those that will spoil.
Coconut oil is better for cooking than olive oil because it withstands heat better. The Magic of Raw Milk
One excellent source of healthy fat is raw milk. In fact, it has all the fats you need in exactly the right proportions. Raw milk and cream are total foods. The offspring of mammals thrive on mother’s milk, and millions upon millions of children have thrived on
raw cow’s milk down through the ages. Pasteurizing milk—far from making it safe— actually damages the proteins in it. Homogenization fractures the long fat chains and turns them into toxic little pieces of the original chains. Raw milk is a nearly perfect food,
but pasteurized/homogenized milk is toxic.
Lactose intolerance has become a very common condition in our culture. In reality, people who think they are lactose intolerant are actually allergic to the toxic brew called pasteurized/homogenized milk.
What about infections lurking in raw milk? They are extremely rare. In fact, data from the Centers for Disease Control indicates that 90% of the infections that come from milk are found in pasteurized milk, not raw milk.
A simple experiment can help explain why. If you put a glass of raw milk next to a glass of pasteurized milk and then introduce an equal amount of bacteria into each one, the bacteria in the raw milk will die quickly while the bacteria in the pasteurized milk will multiply just as quickly. This happens because raw milk contains bacteria-destroying paroxidases and enzymes, but pasteurized milk does not.
The Truly Incredible Egg
Eggs are another total food. The trick is to get free-range eggs that are also hormone free.
Most eggs come from chickens that are fed hormones or hormone promoting, processed foods so that they will lay more eggs. The chicken’s necks are held in clamps so they cannot move and lights are kept on day and night to further increase production. Freerange chickens lay eggs that provide more voltage and have fewer toxins. If you can find
ways to eat them raw, such as in a healthy shake, so much the better. Cooking eggs destroys some of their food value. Saturated Fats and Omegas
Many people are confused about the best types of fat to eat. As a result, there has been an increase in the numbers of people who are becoming toxic as a result of consuming too many Omega-3 fats (from fish oil, etc.). It
might help to think of your cell membranes as if they were your home. They need to be strong enough to be substantial, but they also need doorways and windows to let things in and out. If you build your house out of concrete blocks with no windows or doors, it will be strong, but there won’t be any way to get in or out. If you build it mostly with doors and windows, the next storm will blow it down.
In cells, saturated fats are strong and unsaturated fats are porous, which means they have openings. You need saturated fats (i.e., animal fats) to make your cells strong, and unsaturated fats (i.e., fish oil) for doors
and windows. To make perfect cell membranes, you should eat four times as many saturated fats as Omega-6s and -9s, and four times as many Omega-6s and-9s as Omega-3s. Suggested saturated fats (concrete blocks):
coconut oil, palm oil, beef, mutton, butter,
cocoa, lard, eggs, etc. (Note: Do not eat or
cook with margarine.)
Suggested Omega-6s and -9s (doors): safflower oil, olive oil, sesame oil, rice,
butter, corn, sunflower oil, oats, peanuts, etc.
Suggested Omega-3s (windows): flax and fish oil (fish oil has much more energy than flax oil). 2. The Role of Hypothyroidism in Metabolic Syndrome
The total number of mitochondria in cells, and thus the total number of rechargeable ATP/ADP batteries, is dictated by the amount of functional thyroid hormone present in cells. If normal levels of thyroid hormone are reduced, the body develops hypothyroidism and the number of mitochondria in individual’s cells is restricted.
Hypothyroidism is a very common condition that is implicated in what
is called metabolic syndrome (formerly known as syndrome X).
Many doctors believe this is the basic problem behind most of the
illness in the United States today. Symptoms of metabolic syndrome
include insulin resistance, high blood pressure, central obesity (overweight
with fat deposits mainly around the waist), decreased HDL or “good”
cholesterol, elevated triglycerides (blood fats), and an increased risk for
clotting.
Metabolic syndrome may lead to stress, migraine headaches and even
to ADHD. It causes both childhood and adult obesity. Left uncorrected,
it can cause heart attacks, strokes, and fibromyalgia. Eventually it will
lead to cancer.
Traditional Western medicine has not found a solution for metabolic
syndrome other than diet and exercise. Unfortunately, diet and
exercise alone may not reduce blood pressure, correct diabetes (which starts as insulin resistance), correct blood lipids, or even ensure weight
loss. This is why yo-yo dieting is so prevalent, and so discouraging. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include:
Fatigue—Hypothyroid-ism makes people tired, so they turn to sugar and
caffeine to help them get through the day. Beware of MSG
In addition to hypothyroidism, MSG has been shown to be a major contributor to obesity. MSG is a flavor enhancer that is added to countless foods found in grocery stores, restaurants, school cafeterias, and
more. It is found in processed foods, fast foods, and even in baby formulas.
An excitotoxin, MSG does what its name implies: It overexcites cells to the point of damage. Because it is dangerous, food manufacturers try to hide its presence by listing it under a variety of names including (but not limited to) “other spices,” gelatin, hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP), yeast extract, malted barley, rice syrup or brown rice syrup. Causes of Hypothyroidism: Iodine Deficiency
So what are some causes of hypothyroidism? One of the most important is iodine deficiency. Without iodine, the thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient amounts of thyroid hormone. This leaves cells unable to function normally. In response, the body develops hypothyroidism. Although adults need 12-15 mg of iodine per day, Americans tend to be iodine deficient because it is not readily available in our foods. The iodine that once existed in our soils has long since been washed away, and fruits and vegetables
grown in this soil are lacking in this essential nutrient. Today, while minute amounts are added to some table salts, the total isn’t enough to provide adequately for our dietary needs. Moreover, some of the companies producing table salt substitute bromine for iodine because it is cheaper. But bromine, in addition to not being a nutrient our cells need, is toxic.
Every organ in the body that secretes a substance requires large amounts of iodine to carry out this function. These organs include: the thyroid gland (with the highest concentration of iodine), the salivary glands, cerebrospinal fluid and the brain, the substantia nigra of the brain, the choroid plexus, intestinal mucosa or lining, breasts,  ovaries, prostate, the ciliary body of the eye, the nose, sinuses, and the mouth.
Interestingly, these are the most common sites in the body for cancer among Americans.
Half a world away, the Japanese have different eating patterns than we do in the U.S.
Japanese people consume large amounts of iodine in their foods. Coincidentally, they have the lowest incidence of cancer in the world (except for stomach cancer, which may be related to other aspects of their diet). The Lost Book of Remedies is the revolutionary e-book which is suitable for one of the tools in survival kit because the creator of this program was mentioned lots of benefits about natural medicinal herbs and ingredients to make you feel safe, secure by protecting the health of yourself and dependents in any crisis. Even you can plant it in your backyard to grow effective medicinal herbs to save the life of anyone without wasting your money and time. This e-book will guide you on the right path to provide security, water, food, and all the medicines for securing your life or loved ones at all the time. This guide discussed the common plants that are grown in your backyard, but you don’t know the benefits of that plan which may help you to overcome any significant issues. Sometimes it may replace your antibiotic pills, reduce inflammations, stops bleeding, reverse arthritis, lowers cholesterol, regulates blood sugar level, defeats degenerative brain diseases and much more.

Why Maintaining a Healthy Diet Is Worth it ,2835,"
 It is easy to find valid excuses for failing to maintain a healthy diet. For some, it is a lack of enough time for healthy meal preparation, while for others, it is the love for fast foods. The availability of numerous processed foods and fast-food joints also makes it harder to maintain a healthy diet. However, maintaining a balanced diet has many advantages that you should consider when thinking about eating junk food. Unlike before, enjoying those benefits is now easier with prepared meal delivery. Some chronic and non-communicable diseases like cancer and heart conditions have been associated with poor nutrition. Being overweight also raises the risk of diabetes and affects the body’s ability to fight off diseases naturally.  Eating healthy will equip your body with the right nutrients it needs to protect you from illnesses, and in case you get sick, you will have a higher chance of recovering faster. The rate of obesity is rising rapidly among adults and children alike. The weight loss industry is also booming, which shows that most people are facing the challenge of maintaining a healthy weight balance. It shows that working out or following specific diet trends cannot replace the benefits of a healthy diet. Monitoring the calories you ingest, and their quality remains the most effective way to lose weight. Whether you have a job or still studying, your diet will influence your day. With healthy meals, you can maintain focus for longer. You also lower the risks of diseases, get quality sleep at night, and maintain a better all-rounded lifestyle, which ensures you live longer. For most people, eating unhealthy meals brings about tiredness that ends up in unnecessary napping. It is easy to notice the difference between the energy you feel when you eat healthily and when you consume junk food.  With good nutrients like proteins, your body gets the energy it can sustain to make you feel stronger for longer. On the other hand, junk food fills your body with carbs and sugar that only lasts a short time. Depression is common in the modern era and can be caused by several reasons. One of the least discussed ones is food. The kind of food you consume can affect your mood, determining whether you feel depressed or happy during the day.  You need the right amount of blood sugar levels to feel happy. You also need the right nutrients to feel joyful and productive during the day. Prepared meal delivery is available to make sure you get the right balance of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to ensure your days become more enjoyable. Instead of indulging in junk meals that will not add any value to your life, opt for healthier options that are also budget-friendly. You can choose whatever you like from the wide range of options available on the menu and have it delivered to your doorstep."
Thyroid Disease: Ord's thyroiditis ,1843,"
 Home of Kyle J. Norton for The Better of Living & Living Health  Thyroid is one of the largest endocrine glands found in the neck, below the Adam’s Apple with the function of regulating the body use of energy, make of proteins by producing its hormones as a result of the stimulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the anterior pituitary.
Thyroid disease is defined as a condition of malfunction of thyroid. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is over active and produces too much thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is under active and produces very little thyroid hormones. Thyroid cancer is defined as condition in which the cells in the thyroid gland have become cancerous. 
Ord’s thyroiditis
Ord’s thyroiditis also know as Autoimmune Thyroiditis, named after the physician, William Miller Ord,  is an autoimmune disease in which  microsomal antibodies fight against thyroid peroxidase (TPO-AB) and of antibodies against thyroglobulin (Tg-AB) of that lead to impairment of thyroid function. The disease is most common in European.

7 Truths About Frozen Berries Exposed ,1138,"
 Do you pass by the frozen fruit section because you think that frozen is not up to par? Have you been told that frozen is a waste of money and that you should never buy it, or that it is the ultimate compromise during the dead of winter? Obviously, fresh is great, and fresh and organic is even better. This has long been the mantra for healthy eaters everywhere. However, old school ideas about frozen fruit are being challenged by what some are calling a “new frozen,” aided by advanced quick freezing technology. Consumers who are interested in the best quality and competitive prices are now starting to realize that frozen is really quite cool, indeed. We all know that eating plenty of fruits and veggies is an integral part of overall health and disease prevention. Whole foods such as fruits and vegetables are the best way to maintain and improve health while building a strong immune system.
  There is a growing body of research supporting the consumption of berry fruits on longevity and health. Well known for their powerful antioxidant capabilities, berries have been found to have direct impacts on the brain.

Health Is Wealth But Healthcare Is Not Medical Care ,4503,"
 “Medical care is the diagnosis and treatment of disease, with prescription drugs that are a leading cause of illness and death.” The Journal of America Medical Association reported 106,000 deaths from Adverse Drug Reactions in hospitals were the 4th to 6th leading cause of death, Apr 15, 1998, and the Western Journal of Medicine reported 199,000 deaths from ADRs outside the hospital in June, 2000, totaling 305,000 deaths, then the #3 cause of death in the US, but note– People don’t think prescription drugs are so dangerous because the CDC, doesn’t mention them in their top 10 leading causes of death, but they are liars in business with the drug companies and they don’t report studies that may cut profits.  The Archives of Internal Medicine reported a 2.7-fold increase in deaths from 1998 to 2005 in a 7-year study reported Sep 10, 2007 that showed deaths from ADRs increased from 305,000 to 824,000/yr. But the CDC still lists heart disease as the leading cause of death with 655,000 deaths! The CDC should list Adverse Drug Reactions as the leading cause of death, In the Bible, Job 13:4 links physicians to lying and the Covid shot is the devil’s masterpiece of deception with the gov’t and media boldly promoting decepton that they call healthcare.”. Real healthcare is about healthy habits like Dr. Lester Breslow of UCLA found in a study showing an 11-year advantage, the big three being smoking, drinking and obesity, but he included exercise, sleep, drinking of water and mental attitudes. Breslow’s study began before the Framingham Study reported cholesterol as a problem, so a plant-based diet offers huge benefits beyond medical care. Loma Linda was featured in National Geographic’s cover story, ‘Secrets of Living Longer’, Nov, 2005. National Institutes of Health gave Loma Linda $40 million for a study on why the community lived ~7 years longer than other non-smokers. Ruhling says it was because of the health writings of Ellen White that were reviewed by Dr. Clive McCay of Cornell University. He summarized a 7-page review to say, “no better overall guide is available today.” He wrote that ~60 years ago, but it’s still true due to fad diets. The flu comes after holidays with cookies, cakes and candy. It’s no wonder our immune system is weak due to sugar and I offer my own example of how to beat the flu overnight when working an emergency room and was getting sick with scratchy throat, runny nose feeling achy and cold. My temp was normal, but I filled a tub with very hot water and in 20 minutes I had a fever of 102.5 As the water was running out of the tub, I poured cold water front and back several times—it can double the white blood count, and I didn’t eat supper, so the white cells would be hungry to eat the germs (in contrast to holidays with sugar). I felt better, saw my patients and at 11 PM, I took another fever treatment and discovered I was well in the morning! The moral to this true story is that natural immunity is far better than anything that doctors can offer. “Be Your Own Doctor” is the title of a book by a couple MD’s with a good concept, but most doctors need to see that what we put in our mouths can have a more positive effect on body chemistry that Rx drugs that come with 3500 pages of Adverse Drug Reactions in the Physician’s Desk Reference that is loaded with cautions on prescribing–high risk. I should know better than most MD’s–I was board-certified in Internal Medicine, taught Health Science at Loma Linda, and my former wife died after she saw her doctor for a bladder infection. He prescribed an antibiotic that cured her symptoms in 2-3 days, but she got spots in her skin a few months later. Her doctor referred her to a hematologist who did a bone marrow–no platelets. He did a splenectomy, but no better. High steroids & transfusions, but she died of a stroke. We tend to think the statistics are about other people–it wouldn’t happen to us. The Covid shot is coming for everyone.and we are at war. It’s time to understand the Bible’s warning to come out of Babylon, the false systems of society, “partake not of her sins lest you receive of her plagues…for by her sorcery [note the bad translation of the Greek word, pharmakeia] were all nations deceived.” Rev 18:2-4,23. ..

Diseases and morbidities concerning Indian workmen ,3515,"
 Introduction detox rehab and safety has come a long way from its beginnings in the heavy industry sector. It now has an impact on every worker, in every work place, and those charged with managing health and safety are having more and more tasks added to their portfolio. The most significant responsibility is environmental protection. The skills required to manage occupational health and safety are compatible with environmental protection, which is why these responsibilities are so often bolted onto the workplace health and safety professional. Scenario in India India is a vast country and 58% of its people are labor employed mainly in coal-mining and agriculture. Major occupational diseases/morbidities of concern in India are silicosis, muscle-skeletal injuries, coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, asbestosis, byssinosis, pesticide poisoning and noise induced hearing loss. Gross 121,000 deaths in India were recorded by the survey of agriculture injury incidence study in Northern India. opiate rehab center also estimated annual incidence of 17 million injuries per year, (2 million moderate to serious) and 53,000 deaths per year in agriculture sector alone. Forthcoming issues •    Asbestos and asbestos related diseases; Asbestos is a silent killer and there is a lot of controversy whether to ban asbestos use in country or not.  Most of the developed nations have either banned or restricted the use, of asbestos.  However in India, it is still used mainly in the cement industry.
•    Pesticide poisoning: agriculture being the principle occupation in the country exposes a considerable proportion of population to this occupational related hazard.  One such hazard is the pesticide exposure.  Not only the farmers are exposed females and children are exposed to harmful effects of pesticides.
•    Silica related diseases other than silicosis: Surveys in some of these industries have shown high prevalence (12–54%) of silicosis free silica has been classified as carcinogen. Though many studies have been carried out on the pulmonary effects of silica exposure, the studies on extra-pulmonary effects of free silica exposure such as progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus-erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, glomerulonephritis and vacuities are lacking.
•    Musculoskeletal disorders: Musculoskeletal impairments impact significantly on the population, the health care utilization and the cost for society. The workplace is a significant source of occupational injury, occupational illness and related disability.  The ILO estimates that 40% of all costs related to work-related injuries and diseases are due to musculoskeletal disorders.   Conclusion Working conditions and the nature of employment tend to have major repercussions on the health of a workman. The concept of ‘Occupational health’ has evolved from work-related ailments. rehabilitation centers broadly means any injury, impairment or disease affecting a worker or employee during his course of employment.
India is still very vulnerable country for its communicable occupational health diseases. As more than half of country’s population work as labor, the major occupational morbidities and diseases of concern in India are silicosis, muscular-skeletal injuries, coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, asbestosis, byssinosis, pesticide poisoning and noise induced hearing loss.

Aztec Secrets: Amazing Health Benefits Of Vanilla ,3431,"
 Please like my Facebook page and share your experiences of the spirit and paranormal. NEW! Follow my Twitter feed… The ancient herbalists and shamans of Mesoamerica knew the amazing qualities of many substances that modern humans only see as cooking spices or food flavor enhancers. Some of the plants they administered to heal the sick are yet to be re-discovered. But one plant that produced very special beans was known to have powerful properties to heal and keep people healthy. Today, the essence of that bean is on the shelves of many kitchen cupboards: vanilla extract. Origins of vanilla The vanilla bean plant grows in Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. Natives indigenous to the region understood the special qualities of vanilla for many centuries. When the Europeans arrived, they soon discovered the amazing plant, its medicinal uses and how to use it with food and beverages. Of the three types of vanilla bean, Vanilla planifolia has the best health benefits and is the most treasured. Other than its near ubiquitous use in many baked goods, vanilla was used for centuries to help heal wounds. It can also be used to relieve mild anxiety, and many anectodal tales from as far back as the Aztecs purport the bean is a powerful male aphrodisiac and also assists with weight loss. Of course, if the vanilla is taken in fudge and cakes and cookies, weight loss becomes problematic. Health properties The website livestrong.com notes: “Vanilla contains high levels of antioxidants, according to a study led by B.N. Shyamala from the Spices and Flavour Technology Department of the Central Food Technological Research Institute in Mysore, India. Shyamala’s study was published in a September 2007 issue of the ‘Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.’ Antioxidants are valuable for reducing free-radicals in your body, which are the waste products from normal as well as harmful metabolic processes. Excess free radicals may cause diseases, including cancer. “Vanilla’s anti-carcinogenic property primarily comes from the compound vanillin, a polyphenol known to be a powerful antioxidant. The essential oil of vanilla has been shown to reduce free radicals thought to promote the development of inflammation and certain cancers.” According to Nutrition and You vanilla extract has an array of vitamins and minerals including the B-complex and calcium, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Other significant health benefits obtained from vanilla extract (processed to purity with alcohol) is its ability to act as a mild tranquilizer and sedative, an antidepressant, and helps fight inflammation from fevers. Many swear that whole vanilla beans offer the best health properties. Although expensive, discounts on quality beans can be found on the Internet. Nutrition and You advises caution when shopping for vanilla beans “as adulteration with artificial flavorings is quite common. A well processed good quality pod will remain potent for as long as three to four years.” Vanilla extract has also been shown to be an effective scent used in aromatherapy and patients report it has a calming, soothing effect. It can even be successfully used to combat mild sleep disorders. Far beyond a tasty ingredient of ice cream and candies, vanilla can be a powerful ally in the ongoing quest for good health.

"WRONG idea: Eating healthy “most of the time” for brain health, new study warns ",3240,"
 (NaturalHealth365) Many people try to follow a healthy diet like the Mediterranean diet.  However, sometimes temptations win, and it’s easy to indulge in unhealthy foods, despite eating well most of the time.  Unfortunately, new research shows there’s bad news about having “cheat days.” Scientists have looked closely at the Mediterranean diet and the health benefits it offers, but they have never dug into what happens when unhealthy foods are included in a mostly healthy diet.  In a new study published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, researchers from Rush University Medical Center set out to uncover answers, and what they found was quite enlightening and disturbing! The more you “cheat,” the fewer benefits healthy eating offers to your brain, study reveals Following the Mediterranean diet – or another diet that emphasizes whole grains, fish, fruit, vegetables, and healthy fats, positively affects health.  However, when you cheat on your diet, combining it with unhealthy options like processed meats, fried foods, refined grains, sweets, and red meat, the benefits of your normal healthy diet seem to be diminished. Since the Mediterranean diet has been linked to lower rates of cognitive decline in aging adults, researchers conducted an observational study on 5,001 aging adults in Chicago.  These individuals were all a part of the Chicago Health and Aging Project, which evaluated cognitive health in older adults between 1993 and 2012.  Participants in the study filled out questionnaires every three years, tested their memory and processing skills, and then weighed in on the foods they consumed. Rush researchers analyzed how closely these participants stuck with the Mediterranean diet, as well as how often they ate foods from the Western diet like sweets, fried foods, pizza, full-fat dairy, red meats, and refined grains.  They discovered that when study participants added more Western foods, the Mediterranean diet had minimal effect against cognitive decline. Try your best to stick to your diet to reap MULTIPLE other health benefits Along with showing the dangers of cheating on your diet, this recent study also complements additional studies on the Mediterranean diet showing that it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some types of cancer.  Some research even shows that sticking with a Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of premature death by as much as 30 percent. The bottom line: the more we eat healthy foods like fruits, whole grains, healthy fats, vegetables, and fish, the better it is for the body and brain.  Many studies show that eating processed whole grains, fried foods, and processed meats are associated with cognitive decline, inflammation, and other negative health consequences.  While it doesn’t mean you can never indulge, the key to better health is to avoid cheating as much as possible, sticking to the healthy foods that nourish your body and promote overall health.

Dr. Christiane Northrup - Absolute Best Video Explanation On Covid Vaccine Health Dangers!  ,4809,"
 ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here (Natural News) When MSN recently reported on a family who ran into legal trouble after selling an alternative health product known as Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS, they used a headline that falsely claimed the treatment was bleach and spent part of the article warning about how risky it is. They claim it killed seven people, which is tragic, and yet the same outlet doesn’t feel the need to tell the public about the thousands of people who are dying at the hands of COVID-19 vaccines. The article reports on Mark Grenon and his sons, Jonathan, Jordan and Joseph, who sold MMS to customers through their Genesis Church II, even after a court ordered that sales be halted. When Jonathan and Jordan Grenon were arrested in July, federal agents raided their home and found 10,000 pounds of sodium chlorite powder and thousands of bottles of MMS. Meanwhile, Mark and Joseph Grenon are in Colombia, where they were detained this summer. They are each facing a count of conspiracy to commit fraud along with two counts of criminal contempt. They could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. When Jonathan and Jordan were arrested, Genesis II Church’s bank accounts were also seized, which means the church cannot access its own funds to use them for their legal defense. The government, of course, has unlimited funds, so this family will likely be fighting a losing battle. MSN’s coverage of this story, which appeared under the headline, “Bradenton family may spend life in prison after ‘church’ sold bleach as COVID-19 cure” is misleading and biased. MMS contains chlorine dioxide, which is not, as the MSN headline claims, bleach. The liquid bleach you find on store shelves is usually sodium hypochlorite, but the mainstream media never lets facts get in the way of promoting narratives that support their Big Pharma sponsors. Chlorine dioxide kills pathogens using oxygen, and the EPA has recognized it as a water treatment solution. Proponents say that it can relieve COVID-19 symptoms such as hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen, by filling the blood with usable oxygen. The FDA maintains that MMS transforms into bleach upon consumption and is therefore dangerous, although it’s worth noting that MMS is cheap and easy to make and is a direct competitor to the solutions from major pharmaceutical companies whose profits the FDA has always worked to protect. By the way, this is also the same FDA that claims being injected with chemotherapy toxins is safe. In their coverage, MSN even managed to work in a mention of how President Trump once made comments about the possibility of disinfectant injections helping COVID-19 patients in the early days of the virus; the mainstream media never misses an opportunity to take his words out of context and make him look bad. The Grenon family reportedly earned more than $1 million selling MMS, which they marketed as a cure for COVID-19 and other medical conditions such as HIV, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. The FDA claims that it has received several reports of life-threatening conditions and hospitalizations from people who drank the solution, with at least seven people dying after ingesting it. All loss of life is tragic, and we do not want to minimize the deaths of these seven individuals in any way. But why is the mainstream media so quick to report on these deaths while continuing to downplay and largely ignore the fact that thousands of people are dying and getting sick from COVID-19 ‘vaccines’? More than 56,000 adverse events have been reported thus far due to the jabs, and it’s a widely known fact that most adverse events go unreported, so the real number is likely far higher. On top of that, 2,342 deaths and 7,971 serious injuries have been reported since the middle of December alone. Why aren’t MSN and other mainstream outlets doing more to inform the public about this? The number of people getting COVID-19 vaccines is exponentially greater than the number of people taking MMS, so if MSN really cared about keeping the public informed, they would provide them with accurate information about the damage this vaccine is causing people around the world. ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here"
Smoking oregano clears lung disease ,2693,"

 . The new e-cigarettes may be an instrument used for something few consider when administering herbal remedies.  Sometimes burning the herb, root, or bark and inhaling the smoke is the trick.  We are all accustomed to brewing herbal teas, but for treating a condition, the protocol may have to involve direct contact with the tissue when the ailment involves the inner lining of the lungs.  It’s common to find South American remedies in which smoking herbs is the administration method of the medicine. . One may purchase an electronic cigarette using glycerin drops without the nicotine.  Add two drops of wild oregano oil to the glycerin and puff at leisure.  It is unknown if oregano or any other inhaled herb is effective with fungal attacks to the lungs.  I recommend not using this method to treat valley fever or any condition which is fungal or mold related.  Anyone experiencing these and pneumonia conditions must seek the advice of a medical practitioner. . I learned of an individual who, if memory serves me correctly, was a veteran of some occupation in which whatever he was inoculated with or chemical he encountered came down with an incurable lung condition.  The only recourse was a suggestion to smoke wild oregano.  I’d like to pass on the protocol for anyone who has yet to solve their lung health problem by way of medical advice coming from allopathic or natural healers.  If these avenues have yielded no results, then there’s no need to seek their advice regarding oregano. . If it was poisonous, then being in the vicinity of a burning field that includes it demonstrates a detrimental effect, then heed a special warning.  The reality is that native Americans inhale burning sage, cedar bark chips, and a variety of special herbs used in their ceremonies without ill effects.  In fact, they wouldn’t do it unless there was a healing effect.   . The herb must be grown wild,  the most effective variety comes from the essential oils.  Huffing a bottle ten time in each nostril three times a day as well as a few drops in coconut oil or olive oil rubbed over the chest and back every night until the condition is cleared is an effective protocol. . Although oregano contains the vitamins and nutrients required by the immune system, its primary benefits are owed to its carvacrol and rosmarinic acid content. Both compounds are natural decongestants and histamine reducers that have direct, positive benefits on the respiratory tract and nasal passage airflow. Oregano has so many health benefits that a bottle of organic oregano oil should be in everyone’s medicine cabinet. I recommend you check out this article to learn all the uses for organic oregano oil. ."
The World Health Organization Has EARS? ,5037,"
 By Jeff Thompson As if 2020 wasn’t crazy enough, now in 2021 we have an international organization using AI to monitor what we say for COVID-related thoughtcrime. What am I talking about? The World Health Organization’s EARS program. EARS stands for Early AI-supported Response with Social Listening. In short, it’s an artificial intelligence that combs the internet for any mention of COVID-19, analyzes discussions, and collects data on such for researchers to use. It’s everything Edward Snowden warned us about and more. The stated intent of such a program, according to the WHO, is to monitor the “fake news” (ol’ Trump seems to have created quite the sticky phrase here) that surrounds anything related to COVID. The World Health Organization publicly refers to any information out there that stands in contrast to WHO advice as “the infodemic.” The status of The Infodemic An infodemic is a new concept, but it’s one which the WHO has decided exists. WHO defines an infodemic as such:  An infodemic is too much information, including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak. [source] I’m not sure why too much good information would be considered a problem. However, the WHO believes that even that is an issue according to the above statement. The problems with this infodemic are two-fold, according to the WHO. For starters, people engage in non-WHO-approved actions. Secondly, “it leads to mistrust in health authorities and undermines the public health response.” Also, according to the WHO, social media and internet use are sources of much of the infodemic, and they “can…amplify harmful messages”. [source]  To combat this, the WHO believes they can take four broad steps. For starters, Step 1: one must listen to hear what information the community is discussing. Next, Step 2: promote understanding. These first two steps are rather lame. It’s the next two that are liable to pique your interest. Step 3: Build Resilience to Misinformation. Just what exactly does that step entail, may I ask? Step 4: Engage and Empower Communities to Take Positive Action. [source] This step is the one that should scare you. What on earth are communities being told to do here? Is this to encourage government officials to curb free speech? Are communities to take away the medical licenses of doctors who don’t march in line? What do they mean by ‘positive action’? Let AI monitor everything.  One of the best ways to analyze mass amounts of data is through the use of artificial intelligence. It was with this understanding that the who launched EARS in January 2021. EARS has since tracked 41 different narratives online that pertain to COVID. EARS is monitoring 30 different countries at the moment, searching Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, blogs, forums, news articles, and comments sections of websites as it attempts to harvest as much real-time data as possible. This WHO AI supported program monitors very specific keywords and hashtags to keep accurate tabs on what conversations are trending throughout cyberspace, and therefore, the public. “When people face delays getting the information they need, it can lead to a rise in speculation and conspiracy theories, and that too is an infodemic challenge that can result in harm to peoples’ health,” the WHO states in one recent article.   One strategy to fight back against the infodemic is to “saturate online conversations with high-quality health information that responds to the questions and concerns of the public.” [source] So, are bots used to auto-generate posts across cyberspace, making it seem as if the more significant majority of people believe X, when in fact, Y is what people believe?  Now, let’s think about the article I wrote about the Australian government being able to legally change people’s social media posts. EARS would be a significant benefit for those searching for posts to “correct.” Should you be concerned? Well, for starters, do you like the idea of an AI monitoring what you’re saying online? Do you like the idea of anyone monitoring what you’re saying online? And keep in mind that there’s a significant difference between having other people read what you say online compared to having somebody monitor what you say online. In my mind, I associate monitoring with creating databases – databases used for future decision-making and policy creation. In many ways, 2020 was the pouring of gasoline on a fire. 2021 is throwing some dynamite into the fire for good measure. Will programs such as EARS only continue the current trend of rightspeak well into the future? What do you think about an international organization determining whether what you have to say is deemed trustworthy or not? Are you okay with your local community taking “positive action” against what you enjoy listening to or saying? Sound off in the comments.

Kennedy Drops Bombshell: 70% News Ad Revenue From Pharma ,2371,"
 Natural Blaze.com By Jefferey Jaxen Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is at it again. After speaking in Sacramento, California against SB-277, pummeling the Centers for Disease Control during public testimony in Vermontand appearing on Bill Maher’s HBO show to do the same, he has now broke major news during a recent interview. Speaking with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura regarding the vaccine industry and big pharma, Kennedy confirmed what many have assumed by stating: 
“I ate breakfast last week with the president of a network news division and he told me that during non-election years, 70% of the advertising revenues for his news division come from pharmaceutical ads. And if you go on TV any night and watch the network news, you’ll see they become just a vehicle for selling pharmaceuticals. He also told me that he would fire a host who brought onto his station a guest who lost him a pharmaceutical account.” These powerful admissions by Kennedy are made with the supporting backdrop of five-time Emmy Award winning investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson recently stated: “If people were simply covering in terms of news value, facts, and fairness we’d be giving way more coverage to vaccine side effects, autism, ADD, and all the immune disorders that have emerged in the past and been made untouchable by this environment that I’ve discussed with you (referring to astroturfing.) Indeed it appears that we are seeing a major push by highly unethical, fraudulent pharmaceutical companies attempting to legally corral the entire American public into unwilling consumers of their vaccine products. This current move has revealed major conflicts-of-interest among many senators, news organizations and regulatory agencies. In addition, there appears to be a near mutiny among good senators and congressmen who are rapidly introducing bills to counter the drug company-sponsored vaccine exemption removal push being witnessed in state houses across the U.S. Jefferey Jaxen is an independent journalist, writer, and researcher.

Reduce the risk of blood clots – naturally ,9450,"
 (NaturalHealth365) Many people fear the threat of death from a heart attack, stroke or cancer as they grow older. But few probably realize that all three of these deadly conditions can almost always be traced to the same significant event. In truth, the most common form of heart attacks; the leading cause of stroke and the number one reason for death in cancer patients all come down to the same condition: the formation of blood clots.  For people over 50 years of age, the greatest threat to life is the formation of abnormal vascular blood clots. Why conventional methods to prevent blood clots fail Not all blood clots are bad, of course.  The clotting of blood is important during the normal healing process. But abnormal clotting of blood – known medically as thrombosis – can be deadly. Based on the medical literature, we know that you can reduce the threat of thrombosis by consuming a healthy diet – loaded with antioxidants – and consuming high quality, superfood supplements on a daily basis.  The problem here is an out-of-date, chemical mindset of conventionally-trained physicians.  What a wonderful opportunity they have to teach patients about the value of good nutrition on health.  But, they don’t! Conditions that can increase your risk include atherosclerosis, mechanical heart valves, atrial fibrillation, venostasis, blood clotting disorders and cancer. Other known risk factors include elevated total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides or low HDL. Another risk factor is elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or hsCRP. Just to be clear, hsCRP indicates inflammation and the likelihood of bood vessel injury.  It is considered a major predictive risk factor for stroke or heart attack.  In addition, hypertension and elevated glucose are also known risk factors. Of course, we shouldn’t ignore other risk factors such as, cancer, elevated plasma fibrinogen, thyroid disorders, a sedentary lifestyle, surgeries to the lower extremities, elevated homocysteine and excessive abdominal body fat. Can Western medicine really help us to avoid blood clots and heal the body? In dealing with blood clots, Western medicine often prescribes two classes of drugs to reduce the risk of thrombosis and its complications. These include antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants.  A third class called thrombolytics or fibrinolytics break up blood clots and limit tissue damage once they have occurred. But, wait, here’s the problem … These drugs are unable to effectively address the wide range of mechanisms that can occur to cause a thrombotic event.  In fact, many patients still get victimized by a heart attack, stroke or other fatal incident caused by an abnormal blood clot – simply because the medication they are on is unable to address the various true causes of thrombosis. Remember, many of these drugs cause unwanted side effects.  For example, warfarin – a drug first developed as a pesticide for rats and mice – is commonly used to prevent blood clots in patients at risk.  Marketed under the trade name Coumadin, this drug greatly increases the risk of serious bleeding as well as increasing the risk of death from traumatic injuries. Warfarin is also known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and osteoporosis – when used long term. Choosing natural alternatives for blood clot prevention The good news is, you can choose from several natural alternatives to reduce your risk of abnormal blood clots, even if you are at greater risk due to other medical conditions. These natural blood thinners work much in the same way as their pharmaceutical counterparts. However, because they can be used safely in combinations, they are able to have a multi-faceted effect on reducing abnormal blood clots. Some of the most common natural approaches to thrombosis prevention include: Olive. Both olive leaf extract and olive oil preparations have been shown in laboratory tests to decrease activity associated with abnormal blood clots. Pomegranate. The pomegranate contains a number of bioactive antioxidant polyphenols that are known to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Pomegranate juice has also been shown to reduce platelet aggregation. Garlic. Garlic is fairly well known for its ability to boost cardiovascular health. Garlic extracts have also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation. Salvia. Although the name refers to a diverse genus of plants, covering hundreds of species, salvia miltiorrhiza is a Chinese herb that has been used for hundreds of years in treatment of Chinese restaurants. You have probably heard of chia seeds before as well. Chia are the seeds of salvia and have been found in lab tests to ship this off to you. Tea. Consumption of tea has been show to provide protective effects for cardiovascular health, reducing the onset of heart disease and stroke. Green tea showed promising results primarily in longer term consumption. Quercetin. Doses of quercetin glucosides, the natural form of quercetin, were found to inhibit collagen-induced platelet formation. In addition, quercetin from food sources, such as onion, were shown to have positive effects on platelet aggregation. Tomatoes. These include several nutrients that can play a role in protecting the cardiovascular system. They also have been shown to promote antiplatelet activity. Additional natural ingredients that have been shown to reduce the risk of abnormal blood clots include resveratrol, grape seed extract, fish oil, capsaicinoids, ginger and curcumin.

 Radishes are root vegetables that not only add a welcome crunch to your salads and a tangy pickled taste to your meals, but also provide beneficial effects for your heart, urinary tract and more. Radishes are root vegetables that might not command the most attention but offer plenty of health benefits. They come in a wealth of colors ranging from white to purple to black, and can be round or long and cylindrical. Radishes can be cooked, eaten raw or pickled, depending on your taste or preference. People usually consume them raw as a crunchy vegetable in salads or as part of a number of European dishes.[i] Middle Easterners may drink radish juice to get their nutrients and other perks. In folk medicine in Greece and the Arab world, radishes are regarded as household remedies for conditions such as gallstones, jaundice, liver problems, indigestion, rectal prolapse and other gastric woes.[ii] Here are some of their health benefits as backed by modern research. 1. Better Digestion A half cup of raw radish (about 12 medium radishes) provides 1 gram (g) of dietary fiber, so several servings a day can help you reach your target daily intake.[iii] Fiber has been linked to improved digestion as well as an inverse relationship to obesity, Type two diabetes, cancer and heart disease.[iv] Radish leaves may be particularly helpful for digestion. According to the findings of a 2008 study, animal models fed a high-cholesterol diet had a good fiber source in radish leaf powder, which helped enhance their digestive function.[v] Radishes are known to promote the production of bile, a crucial element of optimal digestion that assists the liver and gallbladder.[vi] 2. Relief of Urinary Discomfort Radishes are diuretic, which means they help increase the production of urine. Since ancient times, extracts from the plant have been used to treat urinary infections among a host of benefits, mostly attributed to the presence of glucosinolates, polyphenols, and isothiocyanates in it.[vii] A radish-containing diet was also found to increase the excretion of calcium oxalate, which forms kidney stones, versus self-selected diets. The crystal count in the urine was found to be significantly higher in both men and women.[viii] Radish also surfaced in a 2012 study to act against Candida albicans, a common cause of oral and vaginal yeast infections.[ix] The root crop was found to help induce cell death in the fungus. 3. Liver and Gallbladder Protection Radish is known to have protective effects on the liver and gallbladder. Based on a 2012 study on animal models, white radish enzyme extracts may shield against hepatotoxicity.[x] “R. sativus extract did not show any toxic effects and could be considered as a potent hepatoprotectant,” the researchers wrote, noting that the leaf powder may be effective in reducing transaminase and total bilirubin — two markers of liver health. In another study, black radish juice relieved cholesterol gallstones and decreased triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol levels in mice.[xi] In Mexico, black radish juice is a folk treatment for gallstones as well as reducing cholesterol. 4. Anticancer Properties A 2010 study linked radish root extract, particularly its various types of isothiocyanates, to cell death in some cancer cell lines.[xii] The root “exerts potential chemopreventive efficacy and induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines through modulation of genes involved in apoptotic signaling pathway,” noted the researchers. Radish seed extract, too, was seen in a 2019 study to induce cancer cell death and reduce the migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma, thus serving as a potential anticancer drug.[xiii] 5. Enhanced Cardiovascular Health Radishes are a rich source of anthocyanins, flavonoids that not only give them their vibrant color but also a number of health benefits. Epidemiological studies show that increased anthocyanin consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.[xiv] These flavonoids usually interact with other phytochemicals for synergistic effects and possibly regulate various signaling pathways involved in heart disease development. Anthocyanins display vital properties that may benefit both heart disease and cancer cases in humans.[xv] Radishes in Your Vegetable Garden Consider planting spring radishes, with successive planting of short rows every 10 to 14 days.[xvi] You may also opt to plant them in late winter in a shielded cold frame, window box or container in the house or on your patio. Sow the seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and thin the spring varieties to 1/2 to 1 inch in between plants. Winter radishes, on the other hand, should be thinned to 2 to 4 inches, or farther apart for the larger roots to develop. The good news is radishes grow well in nearly any soil, as long as it’s prepared properly, fertilized naturally and maintains enough moisture. The root vegetable matures quickly and so should be watched closely to ensure the right harvesting time. You may eat radishes various ways, such as baking and sauteing them with garlic and herbs, adding thin slices to your sandwich or pickling them as an addition to your batch of kimchi.[xvii] You may also introduce added crunch to your salads through radishes.

This simple exercise can increase health and longevity ,6034,"
 The Ancient Masters of India and Asia instructed and promoted the secrets to longevity and a healthy, energetic life. Those that adopted their wisdom and insights were rewarded with extra strength, clearer thinking, and many more years than their peers. Now you too can benefit from their knowledge. NEW! Follow my Twitter feed… Please like my Facebook page and share your experiences of the spirit and paranormal. While it’s true that exercising the muscles through physical labor and walking is crucial as humans progressively grow older, and exercising the brain with challenges and new experiences is important, most modern day health enthusiastist are missing something that the Ancient Masters considered a foundation to good health and life itself: exercising the lungs. Much attention is given by the spiritual adepts to breathing, breathjing exercises and the proper ways to breathe. The attention is merited because physiologically your life depends on breathing. The breath of life also floods your bloodstream and oxygenates the cells keeping them healthy and functioning optimally. Although the lungs are one of the most important things to exercise, many Westerners today are unaware of breathing regimens and the importance to any overall health program. the Lamas of Tibet incorporated breathing exercises into their rites for thousands of years, and the yogis of India claim that true spiritual insights cannot be achieved without the ability to breath properly. Today’s Westerners are rediscovering the importance of breathing properly and how to exercise the lungs for maximum effect through the disciplines of yoga and Pilates. Breathing exercises in the mountains The foundations Yoga is a very ancient health and spiritual discipline while Pilates was first practiced by patients of physical trainer Joseph Pilates. During the 1920s Pilates created the exercise regimen known as ‘The Method’ for rehabiliation. Called Contrology, and while its primary purpose is a balanced body through muscular control and strength while focusing on the spinal alignment, Pilates also considered proper breathing to be a crucial element of the therapy. Three basic elements make up the foundation of Pilate’s approach. The first foundation is controlled breathing done 100 times. Next is what Pilates dubbed The Swan. Especially helpful if you have a tendency toward taking short, shallow breathsn the breathing technique not only greatly increases lung capacity, but slao strengthens the chest and its ability to expand during inhalation. Lastly, is a routine that works to increase the elastic quality of the small muscles surrounding the rib cage. Called The Standing Chest Expansion it’s done, as the name implies, while standing up. The exercises are easy and can be done almost anywhere you have a few minutes of privacy. Video instructions for performing the lung improving exercises are available here and here. Raise your arms from your body while inhaling very slowly Increasing your lung capacity See how long you can hold your breath. The longer you can hold it before exhaling and taking the next breath the better your lung capacity. You can increase your lung capacity gradually over a period of time by timing each exercise with a clock that has a second hand, or a digital clock that displays seconds. How long can you hold your breath? Practice holding your breath on and off throughout each day and every day attempt to hold your breath just a few seconds longer. Over a period of weeks, you’ll find you may be able to hold your breath for as long as several minutes. The Eastern Adepts have been known to hold their breath for longer than five minutes, while the islanders that dive for pearls off Japan and Tahiti are documented to stay underwater without breathing for as long as seven or eight minutes. You don’t need to match those records to achieve significant benefits derived from increased lung capacity. If you like to swim and live near water or have a pool, you can use your swimming sessions to help increase lung capacity. Exercising in the water is not only good for the cardiovascular sysytem and keeps the muscles toned, but it can also help strengthyen the lungs. The reason why water helps is the pressure exerted when it covers the chest. Water compresses the diaphragm and boosts any workout and breathing regimen. Experts advise working out in water several times weekly for about 45-minutes. Doing so will help increase both endurance and lung capacity. Taking control of your breathing When people are told they must learn how to breathe, many are shocked, some laugh. After all, since birth everyone breathes, what’s to learn? But there are proper ways of breathing and deletrious ways. Breathing correctly helps build and strengthen the chest muscles and also increases lung capacity. greater lung capacity leads to greater strength, endurance and overall health as it aids the cellular functioning, digestion, and boosts the efficiency of the auto-immune system. proper breathing also enhances brain functions. Start your breathing exercises by exhaling completely. Try to make every bit of air in your lungs out. You won’t damage or collapse your lungs as they hold air you cannot expel. Now, when you inhale breathe in through your nose as slowly and evenly as possible. You should slowly raise your arms away from the sides of your body while inhaling. This allows the maximum amount of air into the lungs. Mentally count off ‘one-thousand-one, one-thosand two, one-thousand-three while inahling and do the same while exhaling. This is controlled breathing. Your brain is taking over control of a normally autonomic function. Do this exercise throughout the day for about five minutes each time. Repeat the procedure in five minute increments throughout your waking day. These simple exercises could add years of pleasure, strength, and happiness to your life. NEW!

SUNDAY SCREENING: Better Brain Health: We Are What We Eat (2020) ,1228,"
 Our weekly documentary film curated by the editorial team at 21WIRE. The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat. “Neuro-nutrition” is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. The discoveries are ground-breaking: laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity, and has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. This documentary reveals the new research behind the concept of “brain food” – showing how it can even protect the nerve cells and actually improve the development of our brains. Watch:

Be Sure to Avoid These Ingredients in Your Health Supplements ,6184,"

 The men’s health market has no shortage of supplements. A lot of them look really appealing with their promises to improve your muscle recovery, boost your brain power, improve your immune system, and so forth. But did you know that some of these supplements are made with potentially harmful ingredients? You might be thinking to yourself, “Yeah, sure, but aren’t we protected against harmful ingredients by the FDA?” The truth is, the FDA is not stopping health supplement manufacturers from putting dangerous filler ingredients in. These ingredients are sometimes – but not always – listed as “other ingredients” below the main ingredients on a product’s label. So, what are they, and what exactly makes them so hazardous to your health? Let’s take a closer look. Hydrogenated Oils Many supplements have hydrogenated oils – soybean oil in particular. As you might already know, soybean oil is typically genetically modified. Oh, the FDA knows this, too. Just read through the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans; this document reminds us that synthetic forms of trans fat should be extremely limited in the human diet. Too many trans fats in the diet increase your bad cholesterol, also known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Consuming too much can lead to coronary disease and might even lower your “good” cholesterol levels. Unfortunately for us, these cheap fillers are widely used since they cut production costs. Organic soybean oil would boost production costs, and some manufacturers just aren’t interested in that. Heavy Metals and PCBs We know that essential fatty acids can be beneficial for some people. They are known for promoting heart and brain health and are important dietary staples for pregnant women and very young children. But there’s a problem. Many of the fish that these fatty acids are sourced from are contaminated by mercury, lead, and PCBs. A 2011 test showed that 1/3 of the fish examined had PCB levels that were too high for human consumption. This is dangerous because PCBs and other contaminants have been known to cause prostate cancer. In children, high PCB levels have been found to cause developmental delays and neurological conditions. While this might not happen in adults, science has not yet been able to prove it doesn’t. Overall, it’s just another cheap filler product that might do more harm than good. Titanium Dioxide If you have glanced at the back of a supplement bottle, you might have seen something called titanium dioxide. It is not just found in men’s health supplements, but it can also be found in cosmetic products. The fact of the matter is, scientists do not yet know the extent of damage titanium dioxide exposure might cause. Researchers do caution that titanium dioxide should be used with high degrees of care in supplements and cosmetics. So, what kind of harm can it do? Titanium dioxide is known for causing inflammation in the lungs as well as impairing the immune system via DNA damage. Although DNA damage seems to be minimal, the thought that a supplement meant to improve your health could do damage to your DNA is rather worrisome. In studies on mice, titanium dioxide has been shown to do all sorts of harm, including kidney damage and small intestine inflammation. If you are someone with an inflammatory health condition (think Hashimoto’s, Celiac, Crohn’s, or any other autoimmune disease), this could exacerbate your current issues. Therefore, buyer beware. Magnesium Silicate How would you feel if you learned that you were putting something with a composition similar to asbestos into your body? Well, know that some supplements contain magnesium silicate, otherwise known as talc. And this substance can be deadly. Not only is it similar to asbestos in composition, some of it is actually tainted with asbestos! Asbestos is a known carcinogen and, once it is inhaled, it festers in the lungs, causing a build-up of lung fluid. In time, those who are affected basically drown in their own lung fluid. Magnesium silicate is used to prevent caking and even gets added to rice in Japan to make the rice look whiter. While these seem like good things, magnesium silicate is known to be destructive toward the human body. In fact, in Japan, high levels of magnesium silicate consumption have been linked with stomach cancer. What’s the FDA’s take on magnesium silicate? They do not consider it to be food grade, but the regulations on manufacturing supplements with this filler seem rather lax. Artificial Colors Artificial colors have no real business being in mens health supplements – or in any supplement, for that matter. They are basically there just to make up for the loss of natural color due to light, temperature, and air exposure. They’re simply an aesthetic enhancer. That’s it. So, what is it about artificial colors that make them problematic? Consider the studies done linking Red #40 and hyperactivity in children. It has long been speculated that Red #40 is responsible for an array of behavioral problems, and Red #3 is known to cause cancer in animal test subjects. We don’t know exactly how many artificial colors impact the human body since long-term, in-depth studies are needed. But they certainly seem to have potential to cause a good deal of harm. Also, are they really necessary? Many of us just want our expensive supplements to work, regardless of how nice and colorful they look. What can you do to avoid these ingredients? The biggest step you can take is to start reading every label on each supplement you pick up. Do your research on organic, food-based supplements, and opt for the ones that tested negative for heavy metal contamination. If you do find any potentially harmful substances in your supplements, don’t just chuck the container away. Contact the manufacturer and ask them why these ingredients are in their products. Make a post on their Twitter or Facebook. You can even reach out to the FDA and advocate for the elimination of these fillers. Men’s health products should be held to higher standards, but sadly, the truth is that they are not. Do your homework before you buy any supplement so you can avoid these potentially dangerous ingredients.  "
Antidote to the Contagion: Must Read! Must Do! Everyone!--Here’s an Effective Way to Guard Against the Spike Protein Contagion Caused by the COVID Vaccinated! ,16627,"

 State of the Nation Dr. Judy Mikovits (1 min. MP4 is attached) has revealed that the medical establishment has known all along about the antidote to the contagion – a contagion that is now being seen today by thousands of people who have not taken the serum, but have merely come in close proximity with others who have taken the jab.  (The word “serum” is being used here since, evidently, the way to avoid taking the jab is to say “I am allergic to the serum”.)  When the medical establishment and political promoters want to exempt themselves from taking inoculations, they always give themselves a legal way out, while pushing the “citizenry” to take the jabs.  “I am allergic to the serum” is one of their solutions.  Taking the serum is one thing. The spike protein contagion now being experienced in large numbers by those who did not take the serum, but just visited with a relative or friend who did, is entirely new and unprecedented.  ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here What are the side effects being seen by this contagion?  Listen to 5 doctors discuss this unusual onset of symptoms being experienced now by thousands:  URGENT! 5 Doctors Agree that COVID-19 Injections are Bioweapons and Discuss What to do About It The Antidote to the Contagion This antidote to the contagion, that has been known of by the upper levels of the medical establishment and insiders of the elitist class for almost 100 years, is called Suramin, an isolated compound originally derived from an extract of pine needle oil.  It is only available by injection, and has been a closely guarded secret not made openly available to the masses during this “pandemic”, yet is an effective solution for parasites and viruses of several kinds, along with a large number of other conditions.  Yet anyone can now take advantage of this solution by tapping its root origin, pine needle tea, an antidote that is freely available today in evergreen forests and in many people’s backyards. (Sources for buying it are also listed below.)  How can this simple remedy work so well in the face of such a seemingly insurmountable condition?  There is a direct relationship between Suramin (the isolated extract), pine needle tea (a hot water extract of the pine, fir, cedar, and spruce needles), and pine oil (which is derived from the needles though an essential oil steam distillation process).  All three are derived from the properties of the conifer needle. My personal take on this is that it is far better to get Nature’s whole herb source than just a tiny fraction of an extract. There are many other benefits that can be derived from the whole herb that will be missing from the isolated chemical. My observation is that those who maintain high levels of health are not affected by either the serum nor the transference contagion. Their immune system seems to be warding off side effects at this point. Come winter when the spike protein in their bodies will be challenged with new pathogens, we will all discover our true levels of health. Anyone on the fence health-wise, or depleted (which can be said of many of us today), are being affected to varying degrees. The Trail from Suramin to Pine Needle Tea Here is the trail of science and data that shows the derivative relationship between pine needles and Suramin (“the elist’s antidote” to microbial illnesses) – and which also provides a potential antidote for those affected by the spike protein contagion (for reasons explained within the following data): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suramin Suramin is used for treatment of human sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes.[1] [a parasite] Specifically, it is used for treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense without involvement of central nervous system.[9][10] It is considered first-line treatment for Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and second-line treatment for early-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, where pentamidine is recommended as first line.[10] It has been used in the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis).[2] Suramin has been available to the medical profession for almost 100 years. A summary of its antioxidant benefits are outlined in this report – 100 Years of Suramin (attached as a PDF).  The most relevant parts of the summary are outlined below with supportive evidence: SURAMIN, THE FRUIT OF EARLY MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY When suramin was introduced for the treatment of African sleeping sickness in 1922, it was one of the first anti-infective agents that had been developed in a medicinal chemistry program. Starting from the antitrypanosomal activity of the dye trypan blue, synthesized in 1904 by Paul Ehrlich, Bayer made a series of colorless and more potent derivatives. Molecule 205 was suramin (Fig. 1), synthesized by Oskar Dressel, Richard Kothe, and Bernhard Heymann in 1916. Sleeping sickness (also known as human African trypanosomiasis [HAT]) was at the forefront of research at that time, not a neglected disease as it is today, and the development of suramin was a breakthrough for the emerging field of chemotherapy.   Now read the following paragraph within the subtitle (Too) Many Targets in the 100 Years of Suramin PDF to understand its antidote properties to the spike protein contagion (derived from the mRNA that gives instructions to replicate a spike protein in other cells):   Suramin further decreases the activities of a large number of enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis and modification: DNA polymerases (103, 104), RNA polymerases (103, 105, 106), reverse transcriptase (18, 103), telomerase (67), and enzymes involved in winding/ unwinding of DNA (107, 108) are inhibited by suramin, as well as histone- and chromatin-modifying enzymes like chromobox proteins (109), methyltransferases (110), and sirtuin histone deacetylases (111)   This is medical-speak for inhibiting the inappropriate replication and modification of RNA and DNA.  This comment in the PDF also reveals Suramin’s ability to inhibit micro-clots: Suramin also showed inhibitory effects against components of the coagulation cascade (71, 130)…   Excessive coagulation causes blood clots, mini-clots, strokes, and unusually heavy menstrual cycles.  This is why so many people are dying today of blood clots after receiving the serum, and why others are now showing unexplained bruising after coming in contact with one that has taken the serum.  Something is being transferred from one to the other, likely through the breath, complemented by a type of sympathetic resonance, or pheromone emanation.  The method of transfer is unclear at this point, but is certainly happening.  This phenomenon is not an accident, these symptoms were known well in advance of unleashing this serum on the public. Vaccine trials have been going on for decades.  Why did they decide to test a completely new approach with the mRNA without animal trials, thus using humans as the first test case for their effectiveness?  US Center for Disease Control: 3,486 DEATHS – 86,080 Injured in the U.S. through April 17, 2021 Following COVID Injections in 4 Months: More Vaccine Deaths Recorded Than the Past 15 Years COMBINED European Medicines Agency: 7,766 DEAD 330,218 Injuries: European Database of Adverse Drug Reactions for COVID-19 “Vaccines” An Obvious Sham Any natural medicine with 0.01% of these deaths and side effects would have been pulled from the market immediately. That our professionals and decision-makers have continued to allow this sham to continue reveals that this sham is intentional.  The upper echelon of the medical profession promote this program to the people, while they exempt themselves from it, and then take their personal antidote to prevent being affected by the transference contagion.  Since when is it acceptable to kill thousands of people and maim hundreds of thousands more with a “medicine”??? Why are we finding this OK? Why are we still trusting the media and the medical wizards that dreamed up this sham? When will enough be enough?  The People’s Antidote Now the people have the antidote, and it is readily available in the form of pine needle tea. How do we know this? Because Suramin is a derivative of the oils in pine needles.  The whole herbal source (needles) is superior to the single compound extract (Suramin) – because the needles possess a full complement of phytonutrients providing numerous additional benefits that the extract is incapable of.  Now, here is the direct connection between Suramin and Pine Needle Tea: Suramin is Derived from Trypan Blue https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypan_blue Trypan blue is derived from toluidine, that is, any of several isomeric bases, C14H16N2, derived from toluene. Trypan blue is so-called because it can kill trypanosomes, the parasites that cause sleeping sickness. An analog of trypan blue, suramin, is used pharmacologically against trypanosomiasis. Trypan blue is also known as diamine blue and Niagara blue… Trypan red and trypan blue were first synthesized by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich in 1904. Trypan Blue is a derivative of toluene which is a derivative of pine oil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene The compound was first isolated in 1837 through a distillation of pine oil by the Polish chemist Filip Walter, who named it rétinnaphte.[10] I personally recall many years ago one health professional was using a Pine Sol bath to rid the body of parasites. Pine-Sol was based on pine oil when it was created in 1929 and during its rise to national popularity in the 1950s. However, as of 2016, Pine-Sol products sold in stores no longer contain pine oil to reduce costs.Wikipedia Yet pine needle tea provides a similar, if not superior, benefit, due in part to the fact that it is a direct mild extract of the whole herb leaving many of its properties still intact that might be destroyed by excessive heat during distillation and further dissection of its many nutrient components. I harvested some young Dougles Fir needles last fall and have been adding it to my morning tea blend for the last couple of months. It must have been an instinctive call. I discovered the Suramin info just last week. The Douglas fir needle tea I have been drinking provides an energetic lift and a nice boost to the immune system. Pine needles are high in vitamin C and A among numerous other compounds which provide a long list of benefits: A 2011 Korean study demonstrated using pine needles in tea was the best way to access the antioxidant benefits from pine needles.  The study demonstrated that the hot water extract of pine needle proanthocyanidins and catechins offer the highest levels of antioxidant benefits compared with chemical extract processes. There are other known benefits that pine needle tea and the tea made from other conifers share, which include: Herbalists the world over have known all along about the benefits of this simple natural tea. Pine needle tea has been used medicinally worldwide for thousands of years. Pine Needle Tea Video (3 min) https://youtu.be/MY4UNrjnoLA Wild Food Foraging – Pine / Spruce / Cedar / Fir – Evergreen Teas https://youtu.be/RdTcmexTBH0 A few notes of caution:
Be careful with the yew pine (which is not a true pine) and can be toxic, although it does have a few medicinal properties). The cypress is not to be used as an essential oil in high doses, but normally safe otherwise. The ponderosa pine is not good for cows mostly due to the observation when pregnant cattle eat the needles the loss of the calf has been observed, but has a long history of health benefits for humans for respiratory conditions, cuts, wounds, and burns, etc.   By far the vast majority of conifers have been used medicinally for thousands of years with an excellent track record. Get to know your trees. They may provide a medicine cabinet full of health benefits to you and your family. Pine, spruce, cedar, and fir needle tea may end up being the easiest way to gain the numerous benefits of the evergreen trees, along with a natural protection against unhealthy replications of spike proteins today. Combine with other herbs as desired to obtain further benefits and flavors. Sources for Pine Needles There is one primary American supplier (Etsy) for the pine needles (besides harvesting your own) that I am aware of at this point with 3 quality listings, each from a different East Coast wildcrafter: https://www.etsy.com/listing/966522916/eastern-white-pine-needles-1-lb https://www.etsy.com/listing/728484784/blue-ridge-mountains-pine-needles https://www.etsy.com/listing/681617302/north-eastern-appalachian-white-pine-tea Here is the main reference link for new wildcrafters when they post their harvests: https://www.etsy.com/listing/235866986/pine-needles-fresh-cut-or-dried Dosage: 3 cups per day or more of any desired strength (based on the quantity of needles added to a french press or teapot) with an approximate 1-3 tablespoons of needles per cup of near boiling water. This is a maintenance health-building dose.    Stronger amounts of needles to water can be used therapeutically. If it feels too acidic (due to the vitamin C) for your system, moderate the quantity and complement the tea with alkalizing food and dark green herbs or sea vegetables.   — — —     In order to grasp the seriousness of the situation we are in, and to understand why, we need to look back in history to the times in which this very day had been forecast, obviously planned for, and now created.   Here is one clear example:  “Jacques Attali was an advisor to François Mitterrand (former President of France) and wrote this in 1981:   “In the future it will be a question of finding a way to reduce the population. We will start with the old man, because once he is over 60-65 years old, man lives longer than he produces and it costs society dearly.   Then the weak and then the useless who do not contribute anything to society because there will be more and more, and especially finally the stupid.   Euthanasia directed at these groups; euthanasia must be an essential instrument of our future societies, in all cases.   Of course, we will not be able to execute people or organize camps. We will get rid of them by making them believe that it is for their own good.   Too large a population, and for the most part unnecessary, is something economically too expensive. Socially, it is also much better for the human machine to stop abruptly rather than gradually deteriorate.   We won’t be able to pass intelligence tests on millions and millions of people, you can imagine!   We will find something or cause it; a pandemic that targets certain people, a real economic crisis or not, a virus that will affect the old or the elderly, it does not matter, the weak and the fearful will succumb.   The stupid will believe it and ask to be treated. We will have taken care of having planned the treatment, a treatment that will be the solution.   The selection of idiots will therefore be done by itself: they will go to the slaughterhouse alone. “  This fragment is excerpted from his book “Brief History of the Future”, published in France in 2006.”   Understand that we are smart enough to find our own solutions, and apply them. Those willing to take proactive protective measures, maintain their health, and become more self-reliant will rise from this period of change and transformation successfully.    We will be the ones to structure the world to come with a new focus on the common good of all life everywhere. The old mindset expressed by that limited soul above will not be tolerated. That mindset, and those that harbor it, will vanish like the darkness before the approaching dawn.    It is true that many will go with the passing night, yet those that remain will then shine all the brighter.   Do your part. Take care of yourself first, then look to assist any willing to listen and join in the reconstruction.   http://stateofthenation.co/?p=64024 ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here"
300 Italian Health Workers Challenge Vaccine Obligation ,1497,"
 By AFP – Agence France Presse Three hundred healthcare workers in Italy have lodged a legal challenge against the requirement that they get vaccinated against coronavirus, according to media reports Saturday. The case, brought by professionals throughout northern Italy, will be heard on July 14. “This isn’t a battle by anti-vaxxers but a democratic battle,” constitutional lawyer Daniele Granara, who helped build up the case, was cited as saying in the Giornale di Brescia newspaper. “We force people to take a risk under threat of no longer being allowed to exercise their profession,” he added. Granara is also defending dozens of caregivers who have been suspended from work for refusing to be vaccinated. Italy passed a law in April obliging anyone working in public or private social health positions, including in pharmacies and doctors’ offices, to get vaccinated against Covid-19 or be suspended without pay, unless their employer can reassign them to a less sensitive position. After the elderly and vulnerable, caregivers including teachers were the first to be vaccinated in Italy. A total of 52.7 million vaccine does have been administered throughout the country, and around 19.5 million Italians are now fully vaccinated, 36 percent of the population over 12 years of age. According to recent official figures, 45,750 of the 1.9 million salaried healthcare workers have not yet received a single vaccine dose. Original source.

20 Health Benefits Of Thyme Oil ,6134,"
 Thyme essential oil is one of the thoroughbred champions of the essential oils, neck and neck with the very best, as it does so many amazing things it is astounding. It is considered one of the most potent antioxidants known, able to treat dozens and dozen of diseases. In one study done in vitro using wild thyme oil, within 72 hours it had effectively nuked 98% of the breast cancer cells, and it also looks promising on some other types of cancers as well. This is just the tip of the iceberg. it does wonders for cardiac health too, find out more of the amazing health benefits of thyme oil from Prevent Disease.com below. Prevent Disease.com  Oil of thyme is derived from thyme, also known as Thymus vulgaris. The perennial herb, a member of the mint family, is used in aromatherapy, cooking, potpourri, mouthwashes, and elixirs, as well as added to ointments. Thyme also has a number of medicinal properties, which is due to the herb’s essential oils. The benefits of thyme essential oil have been recognized for thousands of years in Mediterranean countries. This substance is also a common agent in Ayurverdic practice. Today, among the many producers of thyme oil, France, Morocco, and Spain emerge as the primary ones. Thyme was used during the embalming process in Ancient Egypt and as incense for temples in Ancient Greece. According to writer Maud Grieve, the Romans used thyme to flavor up alcoholic beverages. Hippocrates, also known as “the father of medicine” noted thyme as an amazing culinary herb that can be grown in gardens and gathered in countrysides. In one of his documents, he mentioned the therapeutic uses of thyme in treating respiratory diseases and conditions.  The medicinal properties of thyme come mainly from its essential oils which are extracted through steam distillation of fresh flowers and leaves. The chief constituents of its essential oil are Alpha Thujone, Alpha Pinene, Camphene, Beta Pinene, Para Cymene, Alpha Terpinene, Linalool, Borneol, Beta Caryophyllene, Thymol and Carvacrol.  20 HEALTH BENEFITS OF THYME OIL 1) Anti-Carcinogenic: According to the journal Nutrition and Cancer, researchers from Celal Bayar University in Turkey conducted a study to see what effect wild thyme might have on breast cancer cells, especially how wild thyme affected cell death and epigenetic events in breast cancer cells. Researchers in this study confirmed that wild thyme induced cell death in the breast cancer cells, noting that wild thyme “may be a promising candidate in the development of novel therapeutic drugs for breast cancer treatment. In as little as 72 hours of in vitro breast cancer treatment, thyme essential oil was able to kill 98% in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with a concentration of only 0.05%. In other studies, thyme essential oil has also proven successful in treating oral and ovarian cancer. A study found that extracts of Mastic Thyne (Thymus mastichina L.) may protect from colon cancers. 2) Acne: After testing the effects of myrrh, marigold and thyme tinctures onPropionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne, scientists at Leeds Metropolitan University in England found that thyme preparations may be more effective than acne prescription creams. The researchers reported that while all three tinctures killed the bacterium within five minutes of exposure, thyme was by far the most effective. Thyme was the most effective of the trio, killing around 100,000 bacteria per ml - or half a million per teaspoonful. They also discovered that thyme tincture had a significantly greater antibacterial effect than standard concentrations of benzoyl peroxide, the active ingredient found in the majority of creams and washes aimed at people with acne.  3) Antispasmodic: Millions of people around the world suffer from coughs, cramps and aches due to spasms. Spasms are unwanted and excessive involuntary contractions which may take place in the respiratory tracts, nerves, muscles, intestines or other organs and may result in coughs, convulsions, epileptic or hysterical attacks, cramps and muscular aches, abdominal and intestinal aches, and even spasmodic cholera. 4) Antirheumatic: There are two main reasons behind rheumatism, arthritis and gout. The first is improper or obstructed circulation and the second one is an increasing concentration of toxins like uric acid in the blood stream. Thyme essential oil can sort out both of these problems. Since it is a diuretic, it increases urination and helps in the removal of toxins from the body. Being a stimulant, it stimulates or activates circulation and thereby sorts out this problem in a separate way. Both ways helps cure rheumatism, and related conditions like arthritis. 5) Antiseptic: Thyme essential oil is a good antiseptic and safeguards wounds and sores against infections. This is mainly due to the presence of components like Caryophyllene and Camphene in thyme. 6) Anti-hypertensive: Researchers at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, reported in the journal Plant Foods for Human Nutrition that an aqueous extract obtained from Thymus serpyllum L. (wild thyme) reduced blood pressure in an animal experiment on laboratory rats. In an Abstract in the journal, the study authors wrote “Our results indicate that TE may protect against hypertension in experimental model of essential hypertension.” It’s important to note that some chemotypes of thyme can also act as hypertensives (see #15) 7) Bactericidal: The same Caryophyllene and Camphene, along with a few other components, give thyme essential oil antibacterial properties. This inhibits bacterial growth within and outside of the body. It kills bacteria as well as keeps them away from the organs in the body. This is particularly beneficial in curing bacterial infections like B-Colitis, renal colic, bacterial infections in the genitals and urethra, intestines, and respiratory system as well as the external exposure of wounds. 8) Tonic: Thyme essential oil also tones up the circulatory system, heart, digestive system, nervous system, muscles, and skin while fortifying them and boosting immunity.

Minerals for Your Health  ,13640,"
 Our food quality has dangerously declined over the past decades and is quite mineral deficient because the soil it is grown in is depleted of minerals. And mineral deficiencies are a big health concern! Even avoiding all processed foods, artificial colors, flavorings, refined sugar, artificial hormones, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides will most likely not be sufficient to meet our nutrient needs fully.  Eating a diet of fresh produce, organic proteins, and high-quality fats may still lack key minerals due to a lack of soil quality. That is because there are industrial chemicals (phthalates in plastics is one) and GMOs where our food is grown. This causes damaged and depleted soil. Minerals are elements, and elements are either present or not. The plants can’t create them! If we don’t clean up our soil, our food will continue to have little minerals. Fulvic acids (which are found in humic extracts) are a type of medicine that can potentially impact many different diseases because they can gain access to cells and provide nutrients which our food supply no longer contains. Fulvic acid makes vital, health-giving nutrients bioavailable to the cells. Because fulvic acid is able to improve how our cells use things like antioxidants and electrolytes, it’s become popular for slowing down aging, improving digestive health and protecting brain function. In fact studies,now show that fulvic acid has antioxidant, neuro-protective, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral complex has high trace levels of naturally occurring Humic and Fulvic Acids as well as high trace levels of Zinc, Iron, Magnesium, Molybdenum, Potassium and more. There is a wide range of up to 70 trace minerals which occur naturally As an active chemical compound, it works in a way that helps us absorb and use other nutrients better — such as microbiota/probiotics, phytonutrients, fatty acids and minerals. Many consider it to be the ultimate “nutrient booster,” and it helps counteract free radical damage. If you have an issue or are constantly dealing with any of the following, you may undoubtedly be experiencing a mineral deficiency: Each of these conditions could be related to some common mineral deficiencies. Once your body is deficient in one or more minerals, it will begin to show signs.  Fulvic and humic acid are intriguing substances that are critical and beneficial to the health of our bodies. Fulvic and humic are incredibly unique, they work rapidly in the body to replenish your nutrient levels supplements. 1 INCREASES ENERGY AND REDUCES FATIGUE Fulvic acid will help prime your body to create more energy at a more efficient rate, and therefore minimize fatigue, leading to an increase in mental acuity, physical performance and endurance. 2 STRENGTHENS IMMUNITY Research has also shown that fulvic acid is an anti-microbial substance, which may further help to protect the body against infectious diseases. 3 INCREASES COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND DECREASES THE RISK OF AGE-RELATED COGNITIVE DISEASES There is emerging research showing that fulvic acid has nootropic properties. A nootropic is a substance which can help increase markers of intelligence and cognitive performance, such as working memory and one’s ability to learn and retain information. Researchers state fulvic acid has the potential to improve and protect cognitive impairments, such as those which fall under the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease results in the blockage of other neurons from making connections. 4 INCREASES NUTRIENT AND SUPPLEMENT ABSORPTION Fulvic acid helps your body absorb more nutrients by increasing cell permeability. In order for your cells to effectively absorb nutrients, they require electrolytes to allow for the flow of ions. Fulvic acid is high in electrolytes. 5 MAY HELP WITH HIGH BLOOD SUGAR, DIABETES AND OBESITY Research has shown that fulvic acid can decrease hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in diabetic rats. Other research shows that fulvic acid can increase antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the beta cells of the pancreas. A study from the Journal of Medicinal Food found that obese individuals who used pure shilajit responded better to exercise than those who didn’t. 6 LOWERS FREE-RADICAL DAMAGE AND ACTS AS A POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT A study published in the Journal of Food Agriculture and Environment concluded that the antioxidant properties of fulvic acid support the idea that fulvic acid should be used in pharmaceuticals as an accessible source of natural antioxidants. 7 SUPPORTS A HEALTHY GUT AND MICROBIOME Research has made it clear that poor gut health is the backbone of inflammation and many diseases. There is emerging evidence that fulvic acid offers a lot of therapeutic potential to improving gut based diseases. The alleviation of these symptoms can help to improve diseases such as small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 8 IMPROVES MUSCLE FUNCTION AND INCREASES TESTOSTERONE One study found that men between 45-55 who used fulvic/humic acid for 90 days experienced a significant increase in testosterone. The combined increase in ATP through increased mitochondrial efficiency and the increase in testosterone will work synergistically to improve recovery, muscle hypertrophy and performance. (Don’t worry ladies – this won’t “give you a beard” – it simply restores proper hormone balance) 9 NATURALLY DETOXIFIES AND CHELATES HEAVY METALS Research has shown that fulvic acids act as a potential mitigator of toxic metal absorption, as seen by reducing toxic metal agents in water. One reason why fulvic acid is so powerful for both digestion and energy levels is due to its ability to detoxify the body. Consuming humic acids helps to bind and break down toxins and metals which are consumed through one’s diet. 10 HELPS TO DECREASE INFLAMMATION Research has confirmed that fulvic acid can decrease proinflammatory markers. Chronic inflammation is one of the key driving factors of disease. Chronic inflammation simply describes a range of illnesses which cause and accompany prolonged inflammation. 11 MAY SLOW DOWN AGING AND INCREASE LONGEVITY Contemporary scientific research surrounding longevity and aging is exciting, with new discoveries being made constantly. Because fulvic acid is anti-inflammatory, protects against oxidative stress, and is good for the mitochondria, it is more than probable that fulvic acid is incredibly beneficial for those of us trying to live a long and healthy life. 12 PROTECTS AND REPAIRS SKIN Evidence has shown that humic acids help to improve skin health. One study published in the Journal of Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigative Dermatology concluded that fulvic acid supplementation significantly improved symptoms associated with eczema compared to other commonly used eczema applications. My guess is that after reading these benefits, you’re quite excited about the potential of fulvic and humic acids to help you improve your health. Fulvic acid truly is an underrated natural compound rivalled by few others for its plethora of health benefits. For those beginning to take Humic & Fulvic  Trace Minerals: Begin with one teaspoon taken twice a day by mouth with or without Unchlorinated water. WHEN: About a half hour to an hour before meals for optimum absorption. Build to full dosage of (1 Tablespoon twice a day) over 3-7 day’s time. NOTE: For optimum freshness, it is recommended to not drink directly from Bottle. Please refrigerate after opening. WHY BEGIN SLOW? Humic and Fulvic acids act as a chelating agent in your body, bonding with positively charged free radicals, heavy metals, toxins, radioactive elements as they clean your cells. Fulvic acid also has proven power to deregulate production of biofilms excreted by bad bacteria (gingivitis, dental carries, e-coli, etc), fungus, molds, yeasts (like candida), and parasites. Taking a Humic and Fulvic extract product transfers many built up toxic elements and in so doing causes a detoxification. in order to prevent yourself from experiencing any detox side effects, we suggest beginning with a gradual dose. For those who have supplemented with Humic and Fulvic before, beginning with full dosage or even increasing dosage by 50% will generate more therapeutic effects. ​Things to watch for include: Deeper Sleep and more vivid or memorable occurrence of dreams Relaxed muscles, joints and increased joint mobility/flexibility (A reduction of lactic acid is common through Humic & Fulvic supplementation) Even, Long-lasting increased Energy (the body’s hydration will improve and cellular conductivity and oxygenation as well, increasing its ability to perform better. Overall Hydration: From eyes to skin to the colon, hydration results are measured in smoother skin, fewer blemishes, reduction of hang nails, fewer ridges in nails, luminous skin, improved coloring and texture, smoothed lines and wrinkles, reduction in dry eye symptoms, improved ability to eliminate.  Humic & Fulvic acid applied topically can benefit your skin. Humic acid’s natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties can be especially helpful as a topical application for skin conditions like contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis and rosacea. Humic and Fulvic Acid have been used for thousands of years as a natural antibiotic and wound dressing. Our Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex can be added to a Spray bottle and applied directly to burns, wounds and problem skin for direct absorpion. The Skin can absorb the Fulvic Acids and their minerals while the Humic Acid will reduce surface infection as well as impede the action of viral or fungal activity. Its high Alkalinity even aleviates pain from bee stings and insect bites which are acid based. As a Mouth RInse: Humic and Fulvic Minerals can do a lot of good when rinsed in the mouth. The first direct benefit is the addition of minerals within the pourous tooth enamel structure, the second is to reduce the ability for gingivitis, halitosis and dental caries to conceal themselves in biofilm. The ability for fulvic acid to reduce biofilm production exposes these bacterial colonies and removes their protection. Many Infections and poor health problems stem from the mouth. With the use of humic and fulvic acids within the body and utilizing it as a rinse, the body can fight infection in the mouth on two fronts and remineralize teeth!

11 Home Remedies for Various Ailments ,4909,"
 Anthony Gucciardi
Natural Society The next time you think about taking a trip to the drug store, check back here for some various home remedies. Admittedly, some old-fashioned cures are best left in history books, but the ones we’ve included here are backed by modern researchers and scientists and great-grandma’s stubborn insistence. She didn’t have Neosporin in her bathroom cabinet growing up, and what with all the ills of modern allopathic medicine and toxin-ridden pharmaceuticals, maybe you shouldn’t either. Nature, after all, offers affordable, effective, and less harmful treatments. Here are 11 home remedies for various ailments and issues. 1. Eat Yogurt for Bad Breath Good bacteria can trounce bad bacteria, and preliminary research indicates that the good bacteria in yogurt can kill off the bad bacteria causing bad breath, according to John C. Moon, DDS. To get the most from your yogurt, be sure that it’s organic to avoid antibiotics and toxic residue. Remember also that the healthiest animal products come from healthy animals raised in pastures on small farms, not factory farms. 2. Treat Cold Sores with Lemon Balm Tea Lemon balm’s antiviral properties counteracts the herpes virus that causes cold sores, according to James Duke, PhD, author of The Green Pharmacy. Brew 2 to 4 tablespoons of lemon balm per cup of boiling water; let it cool and dab onto the sore several times daily. 3. Soften Calluses and Corns  with Licorice This homemade licorice paste can soften hardened skin. Mix a few drops of licorice root extract in a teaspoon of honey and rub onto the rough areas of your feet. 4. Soothe Eczema with Olive Oil When you treat eczema with antioxidant- and moisture-rich olive oil, you can avoid the toxic sludge of additives found in store-bought treatments and save a few dollars. Simply massage olive oil over the affected area as needed. For serious cases, cover the oily area with plastic wrap or a towel to lock in the moisture. 5. Listen to Music to Help Lower High Blood Pressure Research from the University of Florence in Italy shows that listening to thirty minutes of soothing music while breathing deeply lowered hypertension in even medicated patients. After one month, readings were 4.4 points lower than in the beginning of the study. 6. Prevent Motion Sickness with Olives and Lemons Everyone has heard of chewing on moderate amounts of candied ginger (taking into account sugar content) or drinking ginger ale to prevent motion sickness. An alternative remedy is to eat olives or lemons, which reduce the saliva content in your mouth, thereby preventing nausea. 7. Eat Apples to Whiten Teeth Crunchy produce can gently brush your teeth. Apples also have malic acid that helps remove stains. This is just one of many tips for teeth whitening at home. 8. Drink Baking Soda to Treat Urinary Tract Infections At the onset of symptoms, mix ¼ teaspoon of baking soda in 8 ounces of water and drink. Drink this mixture once a day in addition to naturally sweetened or unsweetened cranberry juice or another natural remedy to speed up your healing process  Baking soda makes the bladder environment alkaline, which helps prevent the bacteria from multiplying; cranberry juice has been shown to help treat UTIs on numerous occasions. 9. Heal Cuts with Cloves To prevent cuts from becoming infected, sprinkle on some powdered cloves. Cloves contain eugenol, which is not only antiseptic but also a natural pain-killer. 10. Treat Troubled Skin with Papaya The papain found in papayas and papaya leaf extract naturally exfoliate your skin, helping to prevent buildup and acne. Mix 2 tablespoons of washed and peeled papaya with 1 tablespoon of dry oatmeal. Pat this onto clean skin and wait 10 minutes before washing with lukewarm water and a washcloth. Do not scrape. Repeat twice monthly for smoother, softer skin. 11. Use Apple Cider Vinegar (or Duct Tape?) to Remove Warts Using apple cider vinegar is a simple technique to remove warts. Simply apply it directly on the wart using a cotton ball or swab every 12 hours so that the healing process continues. It is also necessary to cover the wart with a bandage. This is just one of many benefits of apple cider vinegar. Alternatively, a much odder solution involves duct tape. Rather than freezing off warts, a study in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine claims that duct tape can remove 85 percent of the wart compared to the 60 percent with the freezing method. First, clean the area and apply a strip of tape slightly larger than the wart. Rub into place.  Remove the duct tape after 3 days and file down the dead skin with a pumice stone or nail file. Repeat until treated. Other treatments include softening the skin with aloe vera, apple cider or white vinegar, papaya, and milkweed.

"Health Benefits of Garlic – Anti-Cancer, Anti-Infection, Detoxify, and More ",2030,"
 Follow TIS on Twitter: @Truth_is_Scary & Like TIS of Facebook- facebook.com/TruthisScary By Mike Barrett A common ingredient for sautéing, garlic is an amazingly  healthful and popular spice relative of onion, leek, chive and shallots. While a  cooking favorite thanks to great taste, the health benefits of garlic have  also been recognized and taken advantage of since the ancient times,  showing countless individuals the compelling reasons to increase garlic  consumption. The Many Health Benefits of Garlic – Experience them  Today
If you aren’t already a fan of garlic, you will likely load up your kitchen  with the food after reading all it has to offer. Here are some of the health  benefits of garlic: Boosting the Immune System, Anti-Infection
If history tells us anything about garlic, it is that the  food has many well-known health benefits – the most popular being its  anti-infection uses and overall power to boost the immune system. Garlic possess  antiviral, antibacterial, anti-fungal properties allowing it to stand against  all infections. Skin conditions caused by bacteria, virus, fungi or yeast can be  treated by rubbing raw chopped garlic on the affected area.

Eczema and psoriasis linked to liver health ,3269,"
 (NaturalHealth365) Do you want healthy, glowing skin?  Start taking better care of your liver – especially if you’re dealing with eczema and psoriasis. While most people don’t realize it, liver function has a huge impact on your skin’s health and appearance.  In fact, any problem with your liver tends to make itself known in the condition of your skin. The liver is your body’s metabolic factory. It produces the energy needed to keep thousands of different functions going in your body’s cells. The heart needs energy to keep blood pumping to the skin to send oxygen to skin cells and maintain production of collagen. Skin cells require energy so they can regenerate, repair themselves, and eliminate toxins. When the liver isn’t doing its job, breaking down the toxins in your body efficiency, then they have to be eliminated from the body some other way. In some cases, they end up leaving the body through your skin. Simply put, toxins in the skin build up and can cause inflammation, resulting in skin issues like eczema and psoriasis. Fatty liver found in 33.9% of patients with atopic dermatitis While liver problems can result in many different skin conditions, researchers have specifically linked fatty liver to atopic dermatitis (eczema).  Fatty liver is a condition in which the liver accumulates fat and becomes enlarged, and while it’s often associated with heavy drinking, it can be found in children, too. A study on Japanese children found that initially, 17.6% of patients with atopic dermatitis had fatty liver, compared to only 3.2% of children without atopic dermatitis. Researchers continued checking children annually, and three years later, 33.9% of patients with atopic dermatitis had fatty liver.  They believe that since fatty liver in children can be a risk factor for other diseases in the future, it’s critical to take measures to prevent it. This research also found that atopic dermatitis is associated with nutritional deficiencies, eating trans fats, and fat malabsorption – all of which have the potential to affect liver health. Other skin conditions are linked to poor liver health Anytime toxins build up in the skin, which results in inflammation, it can manifest in different skin conditions. Other skin conditions that could be a sign of poor liver health include: Unfortunately, most conventional treatments for these skin problems use drugs or creams to help suppress the skin problem or the issue with the immune system. Treating these skin conditions with antihistamine drugs or strong steroid creams may suppress toxins deeper in the body, so they’re unable to escape. A natural approach to skin conditions that address the underlying problem – the liver – is often a better method of treating eczema, psoriasis, acne, and other skin issues.  Naturally, the antioxidants found in vegetables can help protect liver cells from damage while helping to detoxify the body. In addition, omega-3 supplements and improving your elimination pathways can prove beneficial for treating many chronic skin problems, such as psoriasis and dermatitis.

Wearable Antennas Stretch the Boundaries of Medical Tech ,7254,"
 Researchers from Penn State led two international collaborations to prototype a wireless, wearable transmitter while also improving the transmitter design process New research led by Penn State engineers is paving the way for wireless, wearable health monitoring devices that can collect and transfer information.

Credit: Huanya Cheng  Current research on flexible electronics is paving the way for wireless sensors that can be worn on the body and collect a variety of medical data. But where do the data go? Without a similar flexible transmitting device, these sensors would require wired connections to transmit health data. Huanyu “Larry” Cheng, Dorothy Quiggle Career Development Assistant Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics in the Penn State College of Engineering, and two international teams of researchers are developing devices to explore the possibilities of wearable, flexible antennas. They published two papers in April in Nano-Micro Letters and Materials & Design. Wearable antenna bends, stretches, compresses without compromising function Like wearable sensors, a wearable transmitter needs to be safe for use on human skin, functional at room temperature and able to withstand twisting, compression and stretching. The flexibility of the transmitter, though, poses a unique challenge: When antennas are compressed or stretched, their resonance frequency (RF) changes and they transmit radio signals at wavelengths that may not match those of the antenna’s intended receivers. “Changing the geometry of an antenna will change its performance,” Cheng said. “We wanted to target a geometric structure that would allow for movement while leaving the transmitting frequency unchanged.” The research team created the flexible transmitter in layers. Building upon previous research, they fabricated a copper mesh with a pattern of overlapping, wavy lines. This mesh makes up the bottom layer, which touches the skin, and the top layer, which serves as the radiating element in the antenna. The top layer creates a double arch when compressed and stretches when pulled — and moves between these stages in an ordered set of steps. The structured process through which the antenna mesh arches, flattens and stretches improves the overall flexibility of the layer and reduces RF fluctuations between the antenna’s states, according to Cheng. Energy efficiency was another priority. The bottom mesh layer keeps radio signals from interacting with the skin. This implementation, beyond preventing tissue damage, avoids a loss of energy caused by tissue degrading the signal. The antenna’s ability to maintain a steady RF also allows the transmitter to collect energy from radio waves, Cheng said, potentially lowering energy consumption from outside sources. The transmitter, which can send wireless data at a range of nearly 300 feet, can easily integrate a number of computer chips or sensors, Cheng said. With further research, it could have applications in health monitoring and clinical treatments, as well as energy generation and storage. “We’ve demonstrated robust wireless communication in a stretchable transmitter,” Cheng said. “To our knowledge, this is the first wearable antenna that exhibits almost completely unchanged resonance frequency over a relatively large range of stretching.” The wearable transmitter is designed to compress its top layer in a double arch pattern, shown here, to respond to movement without compromising signal transmission.
 Credit: Huanya Cheng After developing the stretchable antenna prototype, Cheng analyzed it with another research team. The researchers aimed to identify new fundamental pathways for fine-tuning such a device that could be applied to similar, future research. “We wanted to investigate the problem by examining the connection between mechanical properties and electromagnetic behavior,” Cheng said. “Highlighting this relationship can reveal insights about the influence of different parameters on antenna performance.” The team fabricated an antenna with layers and a mesh pattern similar to their previous prototype but lacking the double-arch compression structure. They measured the deformation of the antenna as the mesh was stretched at different intervals, then used computer simulations to examine the relationship between the deformation and the antenna performance. To simplify the analysis of the antenna’s radio signal transmission, the researchers used a mathematical technique to convert certain measurements — such as the width and angle of the repeating mesh pattern — into constant values. With this process, called normalization, researchers can focus on the relationship between specific variables by negating the influence of the normalized variables. The team found that the normalization of different variables provided several avenues for customizing the antenna’s performance. They also found that the simulated geometry of the mesh could produce different outcomes, even with the same set of normalized variables. Though the researchers analyzed wearable antenna properties, Cheng emphasized that their methods could be applied to other radio frequency devices. “We’ve shown that you don’t have to be limited to exploring the effects of one normalized variable,” Cheng said. “Using this method, we can tailor the properties for other antennas or devices that communicate using microwaves.” In this video, researchers test the ordered structural changes as an earlier prototype is compressed and stretched. Unlike the final wearable transmitter, this device creates one arch when compressed instead of two.

Credit: Huanya Cheng Looking toward the future Cheng and his collaborators will continue to research ways to facilitate the development of these devices through application-based studies as well as further fundamental explorations to optimize the design process. “We are really excited that this research could one day lead to networks of sensors and transmitters worn on the body, all communicating with each other and external devices,” Cheng said. “What we’re imagining is science fiction at the moment, but we are working to make it happen.” Jia Zhu, an engineering science and mechanics graduate student conducting research in Cheng’s lab, served as co-author on both papers. On the Nano-Micro Letters paper, other contributors included Ning Yi, Zhihui Hu, Bowen Li, Qing Wang and Chenghao Xing, Penn State; Chaoyun Song, Heriot-Watt University; and Senhao Zhang, Hongbo Yang and Donghai Qiu, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Contributors on the Materials & Design paper included Guizhi Xu, Liangqing Yuan, Xue Chen, Wenbo Jia, Li Yang, and MengJun Wang from Hebei University of Technology. The International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Science, the Suzhou Science and Technology Support Project and the National Key Research and Development Program of China supported the development of a stretchable antenna. The National Natural Science Foundation of China supported the fine-tuning work. Penn State, the National Science Foundation and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health supported both research projects. Contacts and sources:

Hospitals in France forced to SLOW DOWN covid vaccinations as healthcare workers fall ill in droves ,4311,"

 (Natural News) When the experimental covid vaccine was first rolled out at the University Hospital of Brest in Brittany, a staggering 25 percent of the vaccinated healthcare workers fell ill. Many suffered from severe headaches, high fever, chills, sore muscles and consequentially, could not go to work. The rate of vaccine injury was so high, the hospital had to stop vaccinating the healthcare workers altogether. The VACCINE, not the virus, is leading to intermittent staff shortages in hospitals throughout France. This appalling rate of vaccine injury was first observed in clinical trials, but the issues were never investigated or resolved. Now vaccine injury is being extrapolated across entire population groups, as coercion is used to get as many people as possible vaccinated at once. In the rush to vaccinate people in a collectivist fashion, informed consent and medical ethics are being abandoned as vaccine injury becomes a normal way of life. France orders hospitals to slow down vaccine rollout because of widespread injury The real-life effects of this mass medical experiment has caused the French vaccination task force to SLOW DOWN the covid vaccine rollout for healthcare workers. Hospitals in France are now being advised to stagger the vaccination schedule for healthcare workers who are in the same care unit. French authorities also recommend that healthcare workers take acetaminophen before the injection and for two days after the shot. How many drugs must people take to tolerate or counter the negative effects of the vaccine? Isn’t the whole objective of vaccination to prevent illness, health complications and hospital visits? Instead, submission of the mind and the body to vaccination is creating the very problems vaccination promises to prevent. The mass inoculation of healthcare workers using the Oxford-AstraZeneca has had tragic results. Personnel shortages are now being observed in the intensive care units throughout Europe. Approximately one in five young people are negatively affected by the vaccine, whereas the vaccine deliberately causes real symptoms of illness that disrupt the daily work activities of young adults. Vaccine injury is now accepted as normal sacrifice “for the greater good” The town of Brittany is not the only place to suffer from a high rate of vaccine injury. The towns of Quimper, Morlaix, Normandy, Dordogne, and Vannes have reported similar issues across their healthcare staff. One of the hospitals lost half of their physiotherapists after the vaccine forced the staff to take sick leave simultaneously. The vaccine injured 18 percent of the healthcare workers in Vannes, forcing them to take sick leave. The damage is so immense, the hospital of Saint-Lô in Normandy had to suspend the vaccine drive on February 11. The day prior, approximately ten out of fifty vaccinated workers fell ill with high fever and nausea. At the hospital of Périgueux in Dordogne, hospital staff are boycotting the AstraZeneca jab after seeing a “considerable number” of their colleagues suffer from severe adverse events after vaccination. The hospital initially agreed to tolerate a vaccine injury rate as high as ten percent, but saw between 50 and 70 percent of the vaccinated workers fall ill! How long will populations permit this dangerous experiment? As vaccine injury becomes accepted as a normal sacrifice “for the greater good,” many people are refusing the vaccine for conscientious reasons. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was developed by culturing the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cell line derived from the kidney of an aborted baby. Because there is no guarantee that the purification process removes all the cell culture material from the vaccine, vaccine companies cannot promise that fetal DNA is absent in the final formulation. It doesn’t matter if the baby’s DNA does/does not persist in the vaccine; most people find this process of using aborted fetal cells morally repulsive. Even more repulsive yet is that human lives – men, women, and now children – are being treated as experimental dumping grounds, coerced to submit to a “savior” science that sacrifices more human life, health, liberty and dignity along the way. https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-02-24-france-slows-down-covid-vaccinations-healthcare-workers-falling-ill.html"
Dear Vaccinated People: Are You Angry Yet? ,4286,"
 By: Ethan Huff / Natural News  By now, you have probably heard the news from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” are a total failure. And one thing many people really want to know is what the “fully vaccinated” think about this. The jabbed were, after all, told that getting the Trump Vaccine would “stop the spread,” resulting in a “new normal” without face masks, social isolation and economic failure. It turns out that the opposite is true as the injected have been declared by the government as “super-spreaders.” Everything the injected were told all these months by Tony Fauci, Rochelle Walensky and Joe Biden has turned out to be a complete lie. The unvaccinated are doing just fine, of course, but the vaccinated have been turned into walking spike protein “factories” – and the government is now officially admitting this. ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here If any of the vaccinated are actually paying attention, at least some of them have to be upset that they were hoodwinked like this. They deliberately sold their souls and permanently reprogrammed their DNA so they could go out to dinner again and travel, only to learn months later that they were deceived by medical fascists. At least some of them have to be thinking to themselves right about now: Why did I listen to Fauci? Maybe he’s not such a good guy after all, but now it’s too late and my body is ruined. It will probably take some time before a critical mass of vaccinated people come to a fuller realization about what they did to themselves in exchange for a proverbial bowl of soup. When the “side effects” really start to manifest, their regret will certainly turn to rage. Sadly, many will be duped again into blaming the unvaccinated for their health woes, as the mainstream media spreads new lies about how the reason vaccinated people are getting sick is because other people chose not to get vaccinated. If the vaccines really worked, it would be a moot point whether or not someone else is vaccinated. If the vaccines really worked, those who took them would be fully protected against infection. To the contrary, most of the people being rushed to the emergency room or buried in the ground before their time are people who took the jab and suffered serious adverse effects as a result. Until that time, Beijing Biden will continue to urge the “hesitant” to roll up their sleeves, cities will attempt to force their employees to get jabbed, some areas will try mask mandates again, and America will continue to decline ever-further into the third world cesspool that it has quickly and sadly become. We will continue to do our part to let the world know that the people getting infected with and spreading illness are those who took the jab. These are the “super-spreaders” that are plunging society back into tyranny, even if the government continues to falsely blame the unvaccinated. “It’s all a damn hoax, but what are we going to do about it proactively,” asked one of our own commenters. “Haha, the dupes did what they were told, and Lucy still pulled the football away at the last second,” joked another about how the vaccinated are now being told that they need to wear a mask again in order to “flatten the curve.” “If these people don’t want to wear the mask, then they need to gather up their fortitude, and find the courage to defy authority. It’s easy, I do it all the time.” To learn more about how vaccinated people are getting sick and dying because of their jabs, visit ChemicalViolence.com. https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-08-02-dear-vaccinated-people-are-you-angry-yet.html ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here"
Dems On Suicide Watch Over Health Care ,615,"
   Last week Nancy Pelosi was quoted as saying that Democrats should sacrifice their jobs for the sake of passing the massive health care bill that a clear majority of Americans do not want. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week”, Pelosi said lawmakers sometimes must enact policies that, even if unpopular at the moment, will help the public. She compared the health care legislation to Social Security and Medicare, two entitlement programs that, while designed initially to be temporary fixes, became permanent parts of the economy, and to which most Americans have become reliant.

Got Prediabetes? Five Remedies for Your Health ,11540,"
 By GreenMedInfo Research Group If you are at risk for Type 2 diabetes or have prediabetes, here are five natural remedies that you can start now to help regain control of your health When your baseline blood sugar level is higher than normal, but you haven’t hit the threshold for a diabetes diagnosis, you may have prediabetes, a condition that often has no symptoms but is still considered a serious disorder. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prediabetes is “a big deal” that puts you at risk for developing the more serious Type 2 diabetes, heart attack and stroke.[i] Surprisingly, it is estimated that as many as 1 in 3 adults, approximately 88 million Americans, have prediabetes, but most of these individuals don’t know that they have it.[ii] Risk factors for prediabetes are the same as Type 2 diabetes: If you have received a diagnosis of prediabetes or suspect that you may have it, it’s time to get serious about managing your health. Left unchecked, prediabetes can progress to Type 2 diabetes and a host of negative health implications, including increased risk of kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage, limb amputation and more.[iv] Prediabetes: A Lifestyle Disease Prediabetes is a serious warning sign that it’s time to make important lifestyle changes. Ignore the dangers and you may experience deteriorating quality of life and serious health consequences. The good news is prediabetes, and often Type 2 diabetes, may be preventable by making a few key alterations to your daily regimen. Here are five such remedies for prediabetes that you can implement today that will steer you down a healthier, more vibrant path so you can get the most out of your days, and more days to enjoy. 1. Vitamin D Vitamin D is linked to many important health benefits, including supporting strong bones, muscles and nerves. It helps prime your immune system to fight off invasive bacteria and viruses.[v] Supplementing with high-quality vitamin D, or producing it naturally in your skin via sensible sun exposure, may also help prevent the development of diabetes if you are currently at risk. Researchers in 2018 published results of a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials that assessed glycemic outcome measures for adults who were prediabetic, overweight or obese. Twenty-eight placebo-controlled trials representing 3,848 participants were included in the final analysis, which showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly improved glycemic measures and insulin sensitivity and may be useful as part of a preventive strategy for Type 2 diabetes.[vi] A 2019 study evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients with diabetes mellitus. The meta-analysis reviewed vitamin D’s effects on blood sugar and insulin sensitivity, among other biometrics affected by diabetes, in diagnosed patients across 37 studies. Vitamin D levels were found to be significantly lower than the norm among diabetic patients, indicating a heightened need for supplementation. Boosting vitamin D levels led to better glycemic control and is suggested as an adjunct therapy along with other treatments.[vii] 2. Exercise The health benefits of physical activity are legendary and when compared to the negative impacts of a sedentary lifestyle, the choice to become more active is clear, especially if you are prediabetic. Taking a 30-minute brisk walk, five times per week, meets the Department of Health and Human Services’ recommended level of physical activity for adults (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week).[viii] By integrating this level of movement into your routine, you may reduce your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by as much as 58%.[ix] Research into associations between physical activity and sedentary behavior on cardio-metabolic biomarkers in patients with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes found that shifting just 19 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to sedentary behavior caused a 17% increase in the amount of fat in the gut region of participants. Reducing physical activity also increased insulin resistance by as much as 39% and lowered HDL or “good” cholesterol by up to 3.3%.[x] Interestingly, these same negative health effects were observed when participants lowered the intensity of their exercise from moderate-to-vigorous to light intensity,[xi] demonstrating that level of exertion when exercising is an important factor in receiving optimal health benefits. 3. CoQ10 Coenzyme Q10, or CoQ10, is an antioxidant produced within your body that generates energy to grow and maintain cells.[xii] Levels of CoQ10 decrease as you age, making conscious intake of this enzyme increasingly important. Found in meat, fish and nuts in scant quantities, therapeutic levels of CoQ10 can be achieved via a wide array of dietary supplements. Studied for its usefulness in treating migraines, heart disease, dementia and other inflammatory conditions, CoQ10 has also been explored as a therapy to prevent Type 2 diabetes. A 2018 study examined whether administration of CoQ10 would improve insulin resistance in patients with prediabetes. The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studied 80 adults with impaired glucose tolerance, randomizing them into a supplement group or placebo group. After eight weeks of treatment, the CoQ10 group exhibited a significant decrease in insulin resistance, along with lowered levels of toxic free radicals.[xiii] 4. Curcumin Curcumin is one of the most heavily researched of all healing herbs. Curcumin extract was explored as a preventative for Type 2 diabetes in a study published in the journal Diabetes Care. Researchers randomized all subjects to curcumin or placebo capsules for nine months. An array of biomarkers indicating progression toward Type 2 diabetes were measured at baseline and after the study period. After nine months of treatment, 16.4% of subjects in the placebo group progressed into Type 2 diabetes, whereas no one in the curcumin group received a diabetes diagnosis. In addition, curcumin-treated subjects showed better overall functioning of beta cells, a type of cell found in the pancreas that synthesizes and secretes insulin.[xiv] A separate study on curcumin as a “pretreatment” in at-risk rats found that curcumin regulated and moderated key cell signaling molecules to improve pancreatic glucose and insulin responses.[xv] 5. Yoga Now that modern science has confirmed yoga’s many health benefits, this ancient science is beginning to get the respect it deserves. Researched for usefulness in hundreds of diseases, yoga may be a promising treatment for prevention of prediabetes. A 2019 study explored yoga as an intervention in prediabetic adult women. The study characterized liver abnormalities, biochemical changes and stress levels after three months of regular yoga practice. Researchers found that glycosylated hemoglobin and glucose levels were significantly reduced in prediabetic women practicing yoga compared to those in the control (non-practicing) group. Other observed benefits of yoga practice were decreased stress levels and no escalation of fatty liver condition.[xvi] References [i] CDC.gov, Diabetes, The Surprising Truth About Diabetes, https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/truth-about-prediabetes.html [ii] CDC.gov, Diabetes, The Surprising Truth About Diabetes, https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/truth-about-prediabetes.html [iii] CDC.gov, Diabetes, The Surprising Truth About Diabetes, https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/truth-about-prediabetes.html [iv] CDC.gov, Diabetes, The Surprising Truth About Diabetes, https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/truth-about-prediabetes.html [v] NIH, Office of Dietary Supplements, Vitamin D, https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/ [vi] Naghmeh Mirhosseini, Hassanali Vatanparast, Mohsen Mazidi, Samantha M Kimball.

Pumpkin Seeds: 11 Evidence-Based Health Benefits ,4371,"
 Pumpkin seeds, like all edible seeds, pack an immense nutritional  and medicinal punch. After all, they contain future worlds within their compact structure. As Emerson said, “the creation of a thousand forests is within one acorn.” In order to prepare their “babies” for survival outside the pumpkin, Nature equips these seeds with an extremely dense source of organically-bound nutrients, including exceptionally high levels of key, health-promoting minerals. For example, a one cup serving (64 grams) of pumpkin seeds has 44% daily value (DV) of zinc, 22% of copper, 42% magnesium, 16% manganese, 17% potassium, and enough iron (17% DV) to improve iron-deficiency associated anemia. And remember, food-derived minerals are far more bioavailable and biocompatible than inorganic forms, as we recently discussed in the article: Is Your MultiVitamin Trying to Kill You? But beyond the obvious nutritional virtues of the seed, recent scientific investigations have revealed that pumpkin seed meal, as well as its pressed oil, may have great therapeutic value in alleviating the following conditions: These, of course, are only some of the experimentally confirmed beneficial properties of pumpkin seed. Like all foods, there are likely countless properties which within the right context, the right timing, and the right amount, fulfill Hippocrates’ age-old and timelessly true proclamation that food can be our medicine.

The Vitamin Deficiency No One Is Talking About ,14246,"

 Eating a plant-based diet is one of the most healthful actions you can take, but it carries the very serious and potentially fatal risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Although plant-based diets are full of other vitamins and minerals, they are generally devoid of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that helps keep the body’s nerve and blood cells healthy and helps make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vitamin B12 also helps prevent a type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia that makes people tired and weak. Two steps are required for the body to absorb vitamin B12 from food. First, hydrochloric acid in the stomach separates vitamin B12 from the protein to which vitamin B12 is attached in food. After this, vitamin B12 combines with a protein made by the stomach called intrinsic factor and is absorbed by the body. Some people have pernicious anemia, a condition in which they cannot make intrinsic factor. As a result, they have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from all foods and dietary supplements. Vitamin B12 – Prevent Deficiency – Micronutrients on a Vegan Diet Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is naturally found in animal foods or bacteria. Animals obtain vitamin B12 by eating foods that are covered in bacteria or from the bacteria that already line their own guts. Humans have lots of bacteria in their guts, but only in the colon. Unfortunately, humans are unable to absorb the vitamin B12 produced in the colon because vitamin B12 is only absorbed in the small intestine, which is upstream of the colon. Intake recommendations for vitamin B12 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [5]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender [5], include: Table 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B12 in micrograms (mcg) [5]. For infants aged 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin B12 that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B12 in healthy, breastfed infants. * Adequate Intake Vitamin B12 is naturally found in animal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products. Vitamin B12 is generally not present in plant foods, but fortified breakfast cereals are a readily available source of vitamin B12 with high bioavailability for vegetarians [5,13-15]. Some nutritional yeast products also contain vitamin B12. Fortified foods vary in formulation, so it is important to read the Nutrition Facts labels on food products to determine the types and amounts of added nutrients they contain. Several food sources of vitamin B12 are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Selected Food Sources of Vitamin B12 [13] *DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of products within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B12 used for the values in Table 2 is 6.0 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [16]. This DV, however, is changing to 2.4 mcg as the updated Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels are implemented [17]. The updated labels and DVs must appear on food products and dietary supplements beginning in January 2020, but they can be used now [18]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B12 content unless a food has been fortified with this nutrient. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. B12 deficiency 👉 Warning Signs & Symptoms of Vitamin B12 Deficiency The main causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include vitamin B12 malabsorption from food, pernicious anemia, postsurgical malabsorption, and dietary deficiency [12]. However, in many cases, the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is unknown. The following groups are among those most likely to be vitamin B12 deficient. Atrophic gastritis, a condition affecting 10%–30% of older adults, decreases secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, resulting in decreased absorption of vitamin B12 [5,11,35-39]. Decreased hydrochloric acid levels might also increase the growth of normal intestinal bacteria that use vitamin B12, further reducing the amount of vitamin B12 available to the body [40]. Individuals with atrophic gastritis are unable to absorb the vitamin B12 that is naturally present in food. Most, however, can absorb the synthetic vitamin B12 added to fortified foods and dietary supplements. As a result, the IOM recommends that adults older than 50 years obtain most of their vitamin B12 from vitamin supplements or fortified foods [5]. However, some elderly patients with atrophic gastritis require doses much higher than the RDA to avoid subclinical deficiency [41]. Pernicious anemia, a condition that affects 1%–2% of older adults [11], is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor. Individuals with pernicious anemia cannot properly absorb vitamin B12 in the gastrointestinal tract [3,5,9,10]. Pernicious anemia is usually treated with intramuscular vitamin B12. However, approximately 1% of oral vitamin B12 can be absorbed passively in the absence of intrinsic factor [11], suggesting that high oral doses of vitamin B12 might also be an effective treatment. Individuals with stomach and small intestine disorders, such as celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, may be unable to absorb enough vitamin B12 from food to maintain healthy body stores [12,26]. Subtly reduced cognitive function resulting from early vitamin B12 deficiency might be the only initial symptom of these intestinal disorders, followed by megaloblastic anemia and dementia. Surgical procedures in the gastrointestinal tract, such as weight loss surgery or surgery to remove all or part of the stomach, often result in a loss of cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor [5,42,43]. This reduces the amount of vitamin B12, particularly food-bound vitamin B12 [44], that the body releases and absorbs. Surgical removal of the distal ileum also can result in the inability to absorb vitamin B12. Individuals undergoing these surgical procedures should be monitored preoperatively and postoperatively for several nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin B12 deficiency [45]. Strict vegetarians and vegans are at greater risk than lacto-ovo vegetarians and nonvegetarians of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to animal foods [5]. Fortified breakfast cereals and fortified nutritional yeasts are some of the only sources of vitamin B12 from plants and can be used as dietary sources of vitamin B12 for strict vegetarians and vegans. Fortified foods vary in formulation, so it is important to read the Nutrition Facts labels on food products to determine the types and amounts of added nutrients they contain. Vitamin B12 crosses the placenta during pregnancy and is present in breast milk. Exclusively breastfed infants of women who consume no animal products may have very limited reserves of vitamin B12 and can develop vitamin B12 deficiency within months of birth [5,46]. Undetected and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency in infants can result in severe and permanent neurological damage. The American Dietetic Association recommends supplemental vitamin B12 for vegans and lacto-ovo vegetarians during both pregnancy and lactation to ensure that enough vitamin B12 is transferred to the fetus and infant [47]. Pregnant and lactating women who follow strict vegetarian or vegan diets should consult with a pediatrician regarding vitamin B12 supplements for their infants and children [5]. VeganSafe B-12 is a certified organic, vegan formula that contains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, the two most bioactive forms of B-12. Although most of us simply know vitamin B-12 as the B vitamin responsible for energy production, it’s important to understand that “vitamin B-12” is actually a catch-all term for a class of vitamins known as cobalamins — and they’re not equal in their benefits. 1. It’s the Best B-12 Available! Methylcobalamin, or methylated B-12 is the most pure, active, bioavailable coenzyme form of B-12 and when paired with adenosylcobalamin, the other coenzyme form of B-12, forms the most potent B-12 combination available. 2. Encourages Normal Energy Levels Vitamin B-12 promotes energy production in multiple ways. It supports the adrenal glands, red blood cell formation, and helps convert carbohydrates to glucose — the fuel your body uses for energy. 3. Ultra Absorbable Formula Helps Fight B-12 Deficiency B-12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count. 4. Supports Your Body’s Major Processes As a defense against homocysteine, B-12 is nutritional support for your cardiovascular and nervous systems. 5. Natural Sleep Support Some research has linked methylcobalamin to positive effects on sleep due to its influence on melatonin secretion and light sensitivity; it also helps normalize a person’s 24-hour clock. 1. Contains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, the bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B-12. 2. Highly absorbable, no conversion in the liver is necessary. 3. The European Food Safety Authority reports that the combination of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin is the best and safest representation of naturally occurring vitamin B-12. 4. VeganSafe B-12 is an easy and delicious liquid formula — no injections. 5. Certified organic, vegan, GMO and gluten free! 6. Made in the USA from globally sourced ingredients and according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) What is vitamin B-12? Vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is the B vitamin that supports normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, energy production, and for the formation of red blood cells. It’s important to know that vitamin B-12 is a name that refers to a group of vitamins known as cobalamins; this includes methylcobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, hydroxo-, and cyanocobalm 2. What is hydroxo- and cyanocobalamin? Cheap, lesser quality forms of vitamin B-12 often used by bargain vitamin companies who add them for marketing purposes. Cyanocobalamin contains a cyanide molecule that must be metabolized by the liver. The process of removing the cyanide molecule uses methyl groups normally used to lower homocysteine levels (higher homocysteine cause stress on the heart). Cyanocobalamin robs your body of beneficial methyl groups and is a perfect example of an instance when low-quality vitamins are worse than no vitamins. 3. Why is VeganSafe B-12 superior to other cobalamins? VeganSafe B-12 contains adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, a combination that’s better absorbed and used more efficiently in your liver, brain, and nervous system. VeganSafe B-12 does not have to be converted in your liver. Methylcobalamin supports vision whereas cyanocobalamin is thought to be ineffective. Cyanocobalmin is also not recommended for people who smoke, have kidney problems, or don’t metabolize cyanide properly. Jennifer “Awesome B-12! I love this form of B-12 much better than taking pills. Easy to take and taste great. Most of all I noticed how it made me feel so much better within minutes. I felt great naturally, calm, relax and just an overall pleasant feeling.” Charles, FL Kris Donna F. Jose “I do buy this over and over again. I use this product every day twice a day. I no longer have to use energy drinks. B-12 has taken the place of this. This definitely works to enhance energy needs.” Rick Click Here To Order Your VeganSafe B-12 Today! ———————————————————————————————————————— Stunned: Researchers Explain All The Health Benefits Of Combining These Three All Natural Ingredients:  Green tea is so good for you that it’s even got some researchers raving.

Let’s Demand a Recount… of COVID Deaths! ,8393,"
 By: News Editors / Natural News How deadly is the SARS-COV-2 virus? Part of the equation depends on accurately determining just who has died from COVID-19 infection. It turns out that, thanks to changes the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) made to its rules, along with Congressional incentives, America’s COVID-19 counts are almost certainly inaccurate. (Article by Thomas T. Siler, M.D. republished from AmericanThinker.com) America counts COVID-19 deaths differently from other countries. According to Dr. Deborah Birx, speaking at the start of the pandemic, “if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.” However, we must acknowledge that there is a difference between dying from COVID-19 and dying with COVID-19. This is a familiar uncertainty for doctors during the winter flu season. ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin—NOW NEW HNEX HydroNano Extracellular Oxygen Delivery System Product–SEE BELOW! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Click Here In most states, 40-60% of the people dying of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are elderly persons with multiple medical problems who live in nursing homes. A portion of this same cohort dies every year from the seasonal influenza virus. When that happens, did the flu kill them or their cancer, heart failure, strokes, or liver problems? Doctors use their best judgment to fill out the death certificate correctly, but they do not categorize all of them as “flu” deaths. According to the CDC, only 6% of those who died with the COVID-19 infection had no other pre-existing health conditions. The other 94% had an average of four medical conditions already affecting their health. This does not mean that only 6% of these deaths resulted from COVID-19. But it also does not mean that 100% of the deaths among people with other medical conditions should be counted as death from COVID-19 either. If we counted each death that tested positive for flu or had symptoms of flu as an “influenza death,” we would also have hundreds of thousands of flu deaths each year. When it comes to the flu, though, we don’t tally either the 6% or the 100%. The real answer is in the middle. Applying that same logic to COVID-19 means that conservatively 25-50% of the deaths labeled from COVID-19 more likely died with COVID-19. According to an October study from the bulletin of Science, Public Health Policy, and the Law, on March 24, 2020, the CDC changed the way it tabulated deaths for the previous 17 years, resulting in inflated COVID-19 death numbers. Moreover, the change affected only deaths relating to COVID-19. Even more surprising, the Federal Register does not mention these changes, so it appears the CDC acted without peer review and oversight by either the Office of Management and Budget or Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which would violate federal law. The same article says that, in August, the estimate for COVID-19 deaths under the new system was 161,392. However, if the same data had been tabulated under the old system, the COVID-19 death count would be only 9,684. The fundamental difference was that, no matter the patient’s ultimate cause of death, the new system mandated that COVID-19 must always be the first cause of death, with the other conditions listed as “contributing factors” – the opposite of the old system. The CDC also made influenza deaths magically vanish for this flu season. The CDC created a new category of death from pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 to lump those causes together. This only created confusion about COVID-19 deaths — and please, don’t say that masking and distancing reduced influenza deaths while not reducing COVID-19 deaths. Assuredly, some influenza deaths were lumped into the COVID-19 category this season. In addition to a different way of counting deaths, Congress passed the CARES Act, authorizing more money for hospitals that had patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Perhaps done with good intentions, this incentivized financially pushing the COVID-19 diagnosis to the top of the list so that hospitals can pay for the care they give. This too gives more weight to listing a positive COVID test/diagnosis as the cause of death instead of the patient’s other conditions. In addition to new ways of counting cases and financial incentives for listing cases, some states have been found to have irregularities in their COVID-19 death count. Washington state’s Freedom Foundation investigated COVID-19 deaths in May 2020 and found that 13% of the listed COVID-19 deaths did not mention COVID-19. A FOIA request revealed that the Washington Department of Health (“DOH”) agreed in private emails that this was true and promised to change. However, when the Freedom Foundation followed up in December, it again found that 340 deaths out of 2,000 (17%) at the time did not mention SARS-COV-2 or only listed SARS-COV-2 as a contributing cause, not the main cause, of death. Once again, the Freedom Foundation challenged Governor Jay Inslee’s DOH, which agreed to remove 200 deaths from the COVID list. The Freedom Foundation concluded that the DOH was not erring; it was attempting to inflate the death count by 10-15%. In Minnesota in December 2020, lawmakers Mary Farmer and Dr. Scott Jensen conducted a state audit of COVID-19 deaths, eventually sifting through 2,800 death certificates. They found that 800 patients (almost 30%) did not have SARS-COV-2 listed as a cause for death. They have appealed to their state for changes and asked for a national audit of COVID-19 deaths. It is unclear at this point how many states have this problem, but we need a national audit of COVID-19 death reporting. In sum, due to a very liberal description of a “COVID death,” financial incentives, CDC rule changes and, apparently, outright deception or incompetence from some government agencies, America has inflated the death rate due to SARS-CoV-2. Our mainstream media has also been complicit in trying to maximize fear and panic by failing to investigate and reporting only one side to the story. This strong bias has led to some egregious examples such as gunshot wounds and suicides being called a “COVID-19 death.” This dishonesty undermines public confidence in how the pandemic was managed. Using different rules for COVID-19 deaths versus deaths from other infections makes it hard to compare its mortality rates to those in previous pandemics or deaths from other infectious diseases, such as the flu. It seems clear, though, that the COVID-19 pandemic is not as severe as other pandemics. Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins physician, estimated that the COVID-19 infection fatality rate is 0.23% which is close to a bad influenza season. It’s true that the COVID-19 infection is a real threat to the elderly with other medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, etc.) and this group must be protected. Still, parts of our government and media seem to have made a concerted effort to make the SARS-COV-2 pandemic appear more deadly than it actually is. While America’s Frontline Doctors, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, and a handful of other groups have been calling attention to these issues, the medical profession has mostly been silent. If the CDC ceases to be a reliable source for health data, some of our state governments manipulate data, and the major media outlets have no interest in investigating and reporting the truth, how long will the American people go along with this medical tyranny of lockdowns, masking, social distancing, and financial ruin? We know who needs to be protected and we know how to do it. The time is now to let the rest of our population return to normal life. To comment, you can find the MeWe post for this article here.

Microwave oven alert: The dangers of microwaves revealed ,5903,"
 (NaturalHealth365) When I first thought of writing about the dangers of microwave ovens, I hesitated. By now, most health-conscious individuals are at least somewhat aware of the dangers of microwaves or EMFs (electromagnetic frequencies) in general, I thought. Surely, even more must know about the dangers of microwaving food for human (or pet) consumption? Then I read some startling statistics. Still today, 90% of American homes have microwave ovens that are used for meal preparation. That’s 9 out of 10 households in the U.S! Based on this fact alone, I was convinced that another review of the dangers of microwaving was certainly worth the effort. The ugly truth about heating up food with microwaves Microwaves use electromagnetic energy (similar to radio waves) set to a specific frequency in order to agitate water molecules in food. As these molecules get increasingly agitated, they begin to vibrate atomically and eventually generate heat. The increasing levels of agitation that occur when the microwave is on is why microwaves can heat food so quickly and why they do so from the “inside out.” Sounds pretty benign so far, right? The problem begins at the very basic level. The friction that heats the food also causes substantial damage to the surrounding molecules, tearing them apart and deforming them. Unfortunately, over time, as a person eats food from a microwave – the consequences can be devastating. What does science say about the dangers of microwaves? The former USSR banned use of microwave ovens in their country in 1976 and studies as to the questionable nature of microwave ovens began in the late 1980s. These studies have gone largely unknown and at times they have been suppressed by gag orders and big business lobbying efforts. One of the most significant studies was conducted in 1991 by Swiss researcher Dr. Hans Ulrich Hertel in partnership with Dr. Bernard H. Blanc of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the University Institute of Biochemistry. Hertel and Blanc gave volunteers various preparations of milk and vegetables, some served raw, some served after being heated conventionally and some after being heated in a microwave oven. Blood samples were taken right before consuming the food and at various points after consumption. Significant changes were discovered in the blood of the individuals who consumed microwaved food, including a decrease in hemoglobin and cholesterol values and higher white blood cell counts (Leukocytosis) – which is often a sign of an inflammatory response caused by infection or other factors. ”Leukocytosis which cannot be accounted for by normal daily deviations is taken very seriously by hematologists,” Hertel said. “Leukocytes are often signs of pathogenic effects on the living system, such as poisoning and cell damage. The increase of leukocytes with the microwaved foods were more pronounced than with all the other variants. It appears that these marked increases were caused entirely by ingesting the microwaved substances.” Eating food from a microwave increases your risk of cancer Other reports have discovered that microwaving fatty foods leads to the release of dioxins (known carcinogens) as well as polyethylene terpthalate (PET). Dishes made specifically for microwave oven use have been found to leak BPA, or biphenol A, a xenoestrogen that has been linked to breast cancer. A 2010 study conducted by Trent University concluded with “unequivocal evidence” that “microwave frequency radiation effects the heart at non-thermal levels that are well below federal safety guidelines.” If all this science isn’t evidence enough as to the harmful effects of microwaving, common sense might do the trick. Have you ever tasted an egg after it has been “nuked?” What about some broccoli or a cup of coffee? You have to admit, food just doesn’t smell (nor taste) right when it comes out of the microwave. Raum and Zelt, in their “Comparative Study of Food Prepared Conventionally and in the Microwave Oven,” sum it up nicely in terms that are in alignment with “The 7 Essentials System ™” for healing (and feeding) the body naturally: “A basic hypothesis of natural medicine states that the introduction into the human body of molecules and energies to which it is not accustomed is much more likely to cause harm than good. Microwaved food contains both molecules and energies not present in food cooked in the way humans have been cooking food since the discovery of fire. Microwaves, including those in ovens, are produced from alternating current and force a billion or more polarity reversals per second in every food molecule they hit. Production of unnatural molecules is inevitable.” So, play it safe, not sorry. Ditch your microwave today and go back to cooking the way nature intended. Your body – and the planet – will thank you.

6 Food Habits Which Are Going to Ensure Your Good Health ,4737,"
 There are so many benefits we can get from adding good levels of nutritious food in our system. Eating nutritious food is not only good for our body and its functionality but sometimes it can be delicious as well. Eating delicious nutrition-based foods can certainly be helping you to follow a good diet to prevent yourself to not consume lots of junk food. Preventing yourself from doing all those sorts of activities that can potentially ruin your diet chart and ultimately lead you into unhealthy food habits is ultimately very much important. And that is where it becomes very much important for us to figure out about food habits that need to be insured by every individual who wants to ensure that their health is maintained quite well. An individual of this generation must be acting very smartly particularly with their food as modernization is rapidly taking place there are so many forms of functionality that an individual has to be doing in today’s time. To ensure that he’s not missing out on any forms of functionality that can potentially be leading his detachment from society it becomes very much necessary for you to adapt quick measures as soon as possible. And incorporating healthy food habits which are going to be important in ensuring that your health is maintained quite well is ultimately beneficial for your long-term sustainability. One of the most important food habit practices that need to be incorporated in order to ensure that you are not missing out on your healthiest to eat at the right time. Eating food at the right time is also important and should be given equal importance in eating good food in the first place. Like for every individual they should be doing early breakfast, early lunch and also practice early dinner as well. This ensures that you are going to get the right levels of sleeping. At the night and this will ensure that the food that you are incorporating is going to get properly digested and appropriately distributed throughout the system. Resting properly alongside taking good food is ultimately important that is why it is important to practice eating food as early as possible.

7 Milk Thistle Uses to Improve Your Health ,1982,"
 August 6th, 2021 By Dr. Edward F. Group Guest Writer for Wake Up World Milk thistle (Silybum marianum), a member of the Asteraceae family, is a therapeutic herb with a 2000-year history of use in traditional Chinese, European, and Ayurvedic medicine. Originally native to Southern Europe, Asia Minor, and the Mediterranean region, the plant now grows wild throughout the world. In addition to being one of the most commonly used supplements for supporting liver health, milk thistle also offers specialized nutrition for the cardiovascular system, prostate, and gallbladder. High-quality, organic milk thistle is inexpensive, readily available, and should be on your list. Let’s take a look at seven exciting ways milk thistle supports good health. The health benefits of milk thistle lie in its seeds, the extract of which is called silymarin. Silymarin is a potent antioxidant. The extract contains natural compounds called flavonolignans, which are phytochemicals that are part flavonoid and part lignan. Silibinin is the most active flavonolignan in silymarin. While silibinin itself is a strong antioxidant, silymarin is 8 to 10 times more potent than silibinin alone in scavenging free radicals.[1] Milk thistle’s foremost role in traditional medicine is to support liver and gallbladder health. The liver is one of your body’s primary organs for detoxification. Maintaining its proper function is critically important to overall wellness. Milk thistle is one of the best herbs you can use to promote liver health. Silymarin helps the liver grow new cells by boosting protein synthesis.[1] Silymarin may even counteract some toxin-induced liver ailments.[2] CONTINUE READING: Recommended articles by Dr. Edward Group: [PINTEREST]: http://pinterest.com/wakeupword/ [TWITTER]:  http://twitter.com/joinwakeupworld [YOUTUBE]: http://www.youtube.com/joinwakeupworld           [GOOGLE PLUS]: https://plus.google.com/112452105795129310867/posts [WEBSITE]: http://wakeup-world.com  "

Ayurvedic: Oil Pulling: Swish And Spit For Oral Health And Detoxification (Video).  ,1452,"
 So what’s oil pulling? It’s where you take any kind of oil such as olive oil, coconut oil, or sesame oil and swish it around your mouth for 10-15 minutes and then spit it out. Sesame oil is one of the best oils to use for maximum benefits. So why make my jaw work? Lipids in the oils begin to pull out toxins from the saliva. As the oil is swished around the mouth, teeth, gums and tongue, the oil continues to absorb toxins, and usually ends up turning thick and viscous and white. Once the oil has reached this consistency, it is spit out before the toxins are reabsorbed. Oil pulling prevents bad breath, strengethens teeth, gums, and jaws. Also, it helps bleeding gums and dry throats. In Ayruvedic medicine it also known that oil pulling helps more than just your oral health such as: •    Migraine headache relief
    •    Correcting hormone imbalances
    •    Reducing inflammation of arthritis
    •    May help with gastro-enteritis
    •    Aids in the reduction of eczema
    •    May reduce symptoms of bronchitis
    •    Helps support normal kidney function
    •    May help reduce sinus congestion
    •    Some people report improved vision
    •    Helps reduce insomnia
    •    Reduced hangover after alcohol consumption
    •    Aids in reducing pain
    •    Reduces the symptoms of allergies
    •    Helps detoxify the body of harmful metals and organisms Stay groovy! Sincerely, Radical Rose http://radicalrose.wordpress.com"
Vitamin D Levels Determine Success In Cancer Survival ,5225,"
 (NaturalHealth365) A paper published in Demato-Endocrinology suggests that a vitamin D deficiency may account for unexplained disparities in cancer survival rates between different ethnic groups. There is a large body of scientific literature supporting the role of Solar ultraviolet (UVB) light and vitamin D in reducing the incidence and mortality rates of many types of cancers. Scientific research has confirmed the obvious – sunlight exposure and healthy vitamin D levels are good for us. Interestingly enough, researchers have reported that those with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, when diagnosed with cancer, have a significantly higher rate of cancer survival. But, the darker your skin, the more you need sunlight Conventional science often looks at the roles of socioeconomic status, stage of cancer development and treatment protocols to explain why some ethnic groups have a better chance of surviving cancer or not. But, up until now, science pretty much ignored the fact that anyone living in the United States, with darker skin pigmentation, has a lower ability to produce vitamin D through sunlight exposure. Why? You see, a darker skin pigmentation acts like a filter – to the UVB sunlight – and diminishes our ability to produce vitamin D3. It’s been proven, that dark skin pigmentation, can amount to a 95 percent reduction in vitamin D production. People with darker skin complexions (sometimes) need anywhere from five to ten times more sun exposure to synthesize sufficient levels of vitamin D. By the way, the scientific data suggests that darker skin individuals are at greater risk for 13 types of cancer including, bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, rectal, testicular, vaginal and other cancers such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and melanoma. New evidence suggests cancer survival based on vitamin D levels Did you know that the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR) influences the expression of over 1,000 genes – including those associated with diseases such as, cancer and multiple sclerosis. Findings from Germany’s ESTHER study revealed a lower risk of succumbing to disease, when the serum levels of vitamin D levels are adequate. In addition, previously published findings show that people with higher vitamin D levels have lower risks of all degenerative diseases, including cancer. The rising rate of cancer can be tied to lifestyle choices including the avoidance of sunlight. Unfortunately, in these “modern” times, sunlight exposure goes largely underappreciated in preventing cancer or ensuring survival success – once diagnosed. Even the American Cancer Society sees the correlation between healthy vitamin D level and better outcomes in breast cancer. They reported that women with a deficiency of vitamin D had a 73 percent decrease in survival. Patients diagnosed with colon cancer are 50 percent more likely to survive with sufficient vitamin D levels. In addition, many studies have found that patients with high levels of vitamin D were more likely to have thinner skin cancer tumors. When will the insanity stop! We tell people to avoid the sun – essential for life; feed them toxic food and legally sell cancer-causing (chemical laced) sun block lotions. Yet, we still wonder why cancer rates are so high? Educate yourself about the best sources for Vitamin D Being exposed to the sun, your skin will synthesize vitamin D3 sulfate – the best form of vitamin D. One of the best vegetarian sources is mushrooms, with shitake having the most vitamin D. Other foods rich in vitamin D are, fish like sardines, herring, grass fed beef liver, Atlantic cod and raw dairy. Ricotta cheese has more than most other cheeses. And, yes, supplementing with high quality cod-liver oil is another good choice. Getting to know your 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is crucial to surviving a cancer diagnosis and ensuring that any supplement you take is “vitamin D3” – not D2. And, remember, if your primary care physician is in the dark about the value of vitamin D – then get another doctor.

TOXIC GRAPHENE OXIDE in PFIZER VAXX (Karen Kingston) ,1582,"
 Deadliest Vaccine in US History Note: As Karen Kingston was giving her damning Pfizer report on the Doug Billings show (8/26/21) , news from Japan claimed 1.6 Million doses of the Moderna injection were withdrawn due to discovery of apparent metallic substances in unused vials that were reacting to MAGNETS.  (NIKKEI Asia) https://tinyurl.com/95p27wyy See History of #MagnetGate - https://justpaste.it/2srra Another Epic Interview with Karen Kingston who claims Pfizer is in deep trouble as details of their secret mRNA ingredients, including highly toxic “GRAPHENE OXIDE”, will need to be revealed in documents submitted to the FDA in just 2 weeks in mid-September .–  Kingston also reveals a timeline of legislation in 2016 where congress undermined the Nuremberg code by removing critical elements of “informed consent”.  Among the changes was the removal of the formerly required animal trial testing phase, replaced with direct testing on humans as the new normal in vaccine safety testing.   Direct testing on Humans has now replaced animal trials as mankind has become the new guinea pigs as they were in Nazi Germany. These changes are probably responsible for the toxic mRNA injections reputed as the most lethal and damaging vaccines in US history as reported by the CDC’s VAERS system.

Brighten Your Lips with These Splendid Tips ,1489,"
 Lips take a lot of abuse and are the most often over looked part of our faces. We don’t protect them from the sun like we do our cheeks, don’t moisturize them like we do our faces and are not even gentle with them the way we are with the skin around our eyes. But the lips are exposed to more harmful elements than you think. Especially for women, they are often exposed to the chemicals in lipsticks. They are also exposed to the bacteria that are in your mouth, especially if you are fond of licking them. Like the nose and forehead, they are also a little protruded, making them more readily exposed to the sun. In fact, according to Skincancer.org, lip cancer is not at all uncommon but is quite often overlooked. With the amount of care (which is nil basically) we provide our lips, it is no wonder so many of us suffer from chapped, dull or darkened lips! If you are looking to provide more tender loving care to your oft neglected pout, whether for health or cosmetic reasons, this article is for you! What Causes Lip Damage? From simple chapped lips to darkened lips there are many things that can cause lip damage. Below are just some of the following: How do Your Brighten Lips and Keep Them Healthy? Thankfully, there are several ways to brighten lips and keep them healthy. Ways that don’t involve surgery or paying big bucks! References:

10 Food Habit to Reduce Vitamin Supplements Intake ,5273,"
 10 Food Habit to Reduce Vitamin Supplements Intake No doubt there are certain food items which provide a variety of vitamins, minerals and other dietary essentials. A healthy diet is a balanced mix of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. A wholesome diet contains appropriate amount of vitamins and minerals in various forms, while on the other hand, supplements are just another form which can provide all the required required vitamins. Vitamins are important for a human body to work properly. Most people get essential amounts of vitamins by eating a balanced and healthy diet. But if you opt for supplements, then be sure to seek advice on what is required. Vitamins are classified into two categories: water soluble and fat soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in your fat tissues and in your liver. This type of vitamin is majorly found in vegetable oils, animal fats, dairy foods, liver, and oily fish. In case you opt for supplements, then some of the fat-soluble vitamins will not be absorbed easily if taken on an empty stomach. Water-soluble vitamins can’t be stored in the body. There are 13 types of water-soluble vitamins your body needs including vitamin C, B1, B2, B6, B12, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin and Folate. There are a number of supplements available in the market as a substitute for vitamins. Most experts’ advice that if an individual is eating a healthy diet and does not have a repressed health condition, then there is no need to take supplements. There are certain amount of vitamins and minerals available in a healthy diet. In a pristine world, we eat everything which tastes delicious, is super convenient and also offers a generous amount of nutritional benefits. Most dishes can be prepared in a flash and some need a good preparation, but they are actually versatile and delicious. Listed below are some of the foods to reduce vitamin supplement intake: Greek Yogurt: It is the prominent source of potassium, calcium, and protein. It is very creamy, smooth, and extra thick.

It’s also a good source of riboflavin, magnesium, B12, and folate. Just like Greek yogurt it also contains probiotics, which not only helps in digestion but also to manage symptoms of Crohn’s disease or IBS. It can be a drinkable breakfast or quick snack. You can also blend it with smoothies and shakes or add it to soups and breads. Strawberries: It is one of the favorite fruits of summer. It is just more than juicy and sweet. Strawberry contains 160% of your daily vitamin C. Strawberries are a great source for digestion-boosting fibers, for flavonoids, which may improve mental function and fight prostate and breast cancer. Peanuts: Peanuts are full of protein that a human body needs to repair and build muscle. They contain mono-and polyunsaturated fats. Peanuts are important for heart health. They lower your risk of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Pineapple: Pineapples are rich in minerals, fiber, Vitamins B, and enzymes.
