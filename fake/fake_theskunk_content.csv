Republicans Claim Victory in Passing Healthcare Reform,2950,"WASHINGTON — In an apparent about-face, members of the Republican party are not only embracing the recently passed healthcare reform legislation as their own, but insisting its success stems from two minor provisions GOP leaders insisted be stricken from the bill on a technicality. The minor provisions, dealing with Pell grants for low-income college students, were deemed to be improperly included in the so-called “fix-it” bill after being brought to the attention of the parliamentarian by Senate Republicans, and were subsequently deleted. Although the bill passed both houses of Congress without a single Republican vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell claimed victory at a fundraiser last night. “With the deletion of these two wayward provisions,” he declared, “we at last have affordable health care for all Americans.” House Minority Leader John Boehner expressed his dismay at the way Democrats are “trying to take credit” for the job the Senate Republicans did in finding the errant provisions. “Will we let the Democrats claim victory, when it was the Republicans who reshaped the legislation with the discovery of this technicality?” asked Boehner. “Hell No!” In a CNN interview, RNC Chairman Michael Steele told Larry King that the deletion of the two provisions is “the result of Republican ideas and conservative values.” He predicted Democrats will have a “tough time” in the upcoming midterms elections “once the remaining, properly included provisions of this historic Republican health care package kick in and sick people are getting healthy.” In a letter on his website McConnell explained to constituents who are suffering with life threatening conditions, that their health insurance companies can no longer drop them due to the “historic Republican deletions of two minor provisions, which led to the passage of major health care reform in this country.” McConnell said that were it not for the Republicans, the Democrats would have let the legislation pass with the two minor provisions still intact. President Obama, he noted, had no problem in keeping the provisions in the bill, even though they did not pass parliamentary muster. “The Obama administration is a failed presidency,” added Boehner. “I believe that’s the last black president we’ll see for several centuries.” Confused Tea Party members have gathered in Washington D.C. to figure out what position to take. “We’re basically against the legislation — I think,” said one member, “but, I suppose we’ll be giving this whole issue another look.” Violence against elected officials has died down, as the nation’s vandals wrestle with determining which party deserves bricks hurled through the windows of its field offices. “With health care reform under our belt,” McConnell told reporters, “the GOP looks forward to devising more innovative ways to take credit for not passing legislation to meet the challenges facing future generations of Americans.”"
Man Wearing Tea Kettle on Head Opposes Healthcare Reform,2150,"WASHINGTON – A man wearing a teakettle on his head stated his opposition to President Obama’s healthcare reform legislation Saturday during a “Tea Party” protest held at the nation’s capitol. Theodore “Moe” Hammond of Thousand Oaks, California said he dreamed up the idea on his own –- without input from his friends or neighbors — of fastening a tea kettle to his head. “I figured if enough Americans could see a tea kettle on my head,” explained Hammond, “it would force the liberals to drop their plan for government run healthcare.” Although some have been quick to write-off Hammond as an idiot wearing a tea-kettle on his head, prominent scholars on both sides of the political spectrum are taking note. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin called the tea kettle-head man a “true American,” and Rush Limbaugh encouraged listeners of his conservative talk radio show to call themselves “Kettleheads.” Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, advised Congress that it should “pay attention to the man brewing tea on his head.”   Professor Robert Kolander of Tulane University, an advisor to the Obama administration, agreed. “The man with the tea kettle on his head has a remarkably astute understanding of the issues,” said the Nobel Prize-winning economist. “All the economic models and mathematical projections to date pale in comparison to his declaration that ‘Ain’t no government of mine gonna mess with my sicknesses.’” Another man with a frying pan handle stuck up his rectum hoped to reinforce the message.  “We don’t want none of that Obama-care,” said the handle-man, flapping the pan against his upper thighs for emphasis. “It’s a communist program to brainwash us into helping the sick and poor.” The Obama administration was thrown for a loop by the protestors. “We were hoping to pass healthcare legislation before anyone had a chance to attach kitchenware to their bodies,” said Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. “The frying pan dangling from that guy’s ass would have been bad enough, but knowing that tea kettle on top of that other guy’s head will be seen by millions of Americans – that’s a total game changer.”"
GOP Alternative to Obamacare: Insurance by Skin Color,997,"WASHINGTON (TheSkunk.org) – Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation proposed on Monday a system of healthcare that would base insurance rates on the color of a person’s skin.  Heritage CEO Jim DeMint described the program as “the perfect antidote to Obamacare. “ “Very simply, the nearer your skin color is to God’s preferred Lilly White,” said DeMint, “the less you will pay for health insurance.” Users who log onto the website will be directed to a color chart, where they can tick off the color that most closely resembles their own skin and the skins of their family members. “This is not s racist program,” declared DeMint, “because everyone uses exactly the same skin color chart, regardless of the color of their skin.” DeMint said his organization is designing a mobile app that will allow consumers to get an immediate insurance quote by scanning their skin with their smart phones. Speaker John Boehner is expected to introduce the legislation to the full House early next week."
Romney Begins Construction on His Presidential Library One Week Before Election,1626,"BOSTON (TheSkunk.org) — Mitt Romney today broke ground on what he said will be the country’s largest presidential library. “This gleaming institute of knowledge and history will house all the records of my two terms as President of the United States,” explained the former Governor of Massachusetts, “like how I saved the U.S. auto industry, passed universal healthcare reform and added enough schooners to the navy to surpass our fleet in World War I.” According to Romney, all major components of the 195-story edifice will be fabricated by companies with roots in the United States. “The air conditioner, for example, will be manufactured by a firm in Beijing that used to be in Toledo.” Romney said the library will offer a comprehensive look at his presidency, including an entire wing dedicated to “my landslide victory in the 2012 election.” A statement from the Obama campaign called the announcement “a publicity stunt carried out by a desperate candidate.” Romney refuted the accusation. “President Obama has been in office four years and hasn’t even started his presidential library,” he stated.  “That’s not the kind of leadership the American people need.” Plans for expansion are already on the table. “By the time I leave office, there will be over six-hundred Mitt Romney Presidential Libraries across the United States and in select countries around the world,” he said. “And that will create another 12 million new jobs.” When asked about the wisdom of building a presidential library before the election has taken place, Romney shrugged. “If doesn’t work out,” he added, “I could always sell it to Hillary.”"
Romney Campaign Hiring Liars,2050,"BOSTON (TheSkunk.org) — Mitt Romney is looking for a few good liars. According to its website, the Romney for President campaign is hiring staffers to create outlandish stories and preposterous allegations about President Obama, and then disseminate them through word-of-mouth and the blogosphere. “We’re accepting applications from recent college graduates and those ready to graduate in the Spring,” said Thomas McCreary, human relations director for the campaign. “Although we prefer a background in journalism, anyone who can fabricate a good, solid untruth will be considered.” McCreary said the campaign is looking for creative, out-of-the-box thinkers. “If an aspiring liar comes in and tells me Obama is a Muslim, I show him out the door, immediately,” he said. “ We want fresh, new and exciting falsehoods. Tell me Obama is a transsexual Muslim, who wants to paint the White House pink and spread sharia law, and now you’ve got my attention.” The positions, as listed on Romney’s website, have titles such as Business Analyst, Content Coordinator, Copywriter, Designer, Interactive Designer, and Political Content Coordinator, “but essentially,” according to McCreary, “their only job description is to mislead the public by figuring out new and interesting ways to blame the President for 9/11 or to claim that citizens under the new healthcare law will be secretly implanted with genital warts.” As an example, McCreary referenced his most recent hire, a senior from Liberty University who continually tweeted and re-tweeted “Obama eats his own feces,” until Fox News picked up on the story. “That young man represents the future of America,” noted McCreary. “He has the courage to spread misinformation, and the determination to make it stick.” “Everyone working for the campaign must undergo a lie-detector test,” he added, “and if they pass – if they keep telling the truth about everything — we say ‘no thank you,’ and kick them out the door.” McCreary encourages job-seeking liars to apply for the Romney campaign positions online .  "
Bachmann Blames Apple CEO's Death on Obama's 'Jobs Killing' Policies,802,"WASHINGTON — GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann told reporters today she believes the death of Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs is the sad consequence of President Obama’s “Jobs Killing” policies. Bachmann accused Obama of lacking the leadership necessary to “keep Jobs thriving in this economy.” “When you look at the administration’s ‘Jobs-Killing Healthcare Legislation,’ ‘Jobs-Killing Taxation Schemes,’ and ‘Jobs-Killing Trade Strategies,'” said the Minnesota congresswoman, “it becomes clear that Mr. Jobs was directly targeted by this president.” Bachmann praised the late Silicon Valley leader as epitomizing the very meaning of the word “Jobs.” “I’ve been saying for three years that we will lose Jobs during the Obama administration,” she added, “and, sadly, I’ve been proven right.”"
Boehner Blames Japan Quake on Obama Tax Policy,2485,"WASHINGTON (TheSkunk.org) – Calling it another example of why he believes it is bad for the economy to raise taxes during a recession, Speaker John Boehner laid blame for the recent 8.9 earthquake off the coast of Japan at the failed policies of the Obama administration. Boehner said the “Obamaquake” — and the subsequent “Tsobamanami” that inundated the island nation – only make it tougher for U.S. businesses to hire American workers and will ulimately do nothing to reduce the unemployment rate. “Japan is one of our closest allies,” lamented Boehner, tears welling up in his eyes, “and allowing an earthquake of this magnitude to wreak havoc on those wonderful, dear people will not produce a single job in our own country. It’s a misguided energy policy; we should be drilling our way out of this.” The Speaker contended that under George Bush, natural disasters were limited to evil countries only, reminding reporters that under the leadership of a Republican president, there were no tsunamis in France or England or Canada. “If this devastating earth movement doesn’t illustrate why it’s important to lower taxes on the super-rich, I don’t know what does,” he noted. “The Republicans have a plan for this.  We want to lower corporate tax rates, eliminate unions, prevent women from having an abortion, throw away healthcare for millions of uninsured Americans, bring back prayer in public schools, convert the Jews and make it impossible to sue financial institutions, even in cases of rape or incest.” Boehner warned that America can no longer afford Obama’s dangerous government takeover of the government that led to the seismic catastrophe in Japan. “It’s about personal responsibility, smaller government and fewer shifts in the earth’s techtonic plates.” “When the American people compare our plan to the destruction caused by Obamaquake, I’m sure they will regret electing a black man with a dubious past as their president — even if they believe he wasn’t born in Kenya and isn’t a Muslim, as he contends — and agree to do away with the minimum wage and public education.  Americans are getting tired of the same old rhetoric coming from the White House, and I’m sure they will enthusaistically support a new president who will put the interests of huge coporations above their own — someone who doesn’t create earthquakes, but knows how to profit from them.” Boehner believes a majority of the public is on his side. “This president just doesn’t’ get it,” he added."
"Bachmann, Tea Party to Assist Egyptian Protesters",1741,"WASHINGTON (TheSkunk.org) — Representative Michelle Bachmann (R-MN) is leading a contingent of Tea Party activists on a trip to Cairo to offer their expertise to the hundreds of thousands of Egyptian citizens who have been rallying against their government for over a week. Once on the ground, the Tea Partiers are planning to help the protesters paint signs, devise catchy chants, and determine which of their despotic Egyptian leaders are Nazis and which are Communists. “In our wildest imaginations, we never dreamed the Tea Party movement would spread worldwide,” said Bachmann, who recently gave voice to the extreme conservative organization in her response to President Obama’s State of the Union address. “The Egyptian people do not want their government offering affordable healthcare for the sick or providing financial assistance for their unemployed fellow citizens any more than their American counterparts,” stated Bachmann. “Their dreams of living with smaller government, as well as the elimination of entitlement programs and Jews, are the same as ours.” The Minnesota congresswoman noted other similarities between the United States and the 5000-year-old Middle-east republic. “Both of our countries flourished under slavery.” Bachmann appeared Tuesday on Al Jezeera television, where she asserted that Hosni Mubarak is not really Egyptian and was actually born in Tel-Avi. “We encourage our Egyptian brothers and sisters to demand President Mubarak show his birth certificate,” she said, “and to start home-schooling their children.” Bachmann and the Tea Partiers will touch down at Cairo International Airport on Sunday. “We chose Sunday,” she explained, “so we can attend a church service with our new Egyptian friends.”"
Senator Wants Nation’s Jobless to be His Servants,1770,"WASHINGTON — After blocking passage of a jobless benefits bill, Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY) announced today he will compensate the nation’s unemployed by offering them non-paid positions as his personal servants. “They should consider it an internship,” said Bunning. “They will learn the inner workings of my life — where I keep the toilet paper, for instance, or how I clip my toenails — while gaining valuable, real-world job experience.” Bunning said that listing his name on a resume will impress prospective employers. “When a company learns that a jobseeker has worked for me as a man-servant or clerical-maid, they will enthusiastically hire that individual.” Bunning told reporters the tasks required of his servants will include washing his car, shredding incriminating documents and performing oral sex on him from the other side of a quarter-inch sheet of plywood, through which a half-inch hole has been drilled. In exchange, Bunning said all his servants will receive one meal a day and “a piece of land where they can go to sleep.” Because the servants will not be receiving paychecks, Bunning said he is under no obligation to offer employer-provided healthcare. “Once their services are no longer needed, we take them out back, shoot them in the head, and put them in the compost pile.” He called it a “win-win-win” situation that demonstrates his commitment to the environment. Bunning criticized the Obama administration for throwing billions of dollars into a futile stimulus package instead of going with the “Bunning Plan,” which he contends will actually produce results. “The President’s Recovery Act hasn’t created a single job,” he noted. “Yet I have single-handedly given every unemployed person in this country an opportunity to suck my dick.”"
Kanye West hired by Republicans to heckle President,1505,"WASHINGTON — The Republican National Committee has hired Kanye West to interrupt President Obama’s speeches on healthcare, according to RNC Chairman Michael Steele.  “We thought we scored a touchdown for our ‘distract and deter’ policy with [Congressman Joe] Wilson,” said Steele, “but after watching Kanye’s embarrassing outburst at the Video Music Awards, we knew he was our man.” Steele praised the hip-hop star for his “total lack of inhibitions,” calling him a role model for the conservative movement. “We need more people like Kanye, who are eager to inject foolishness and impropriety into the healthcare debate.” West is scheduled to attend all of Obama’s upcoming speeches related to heathcare reform, and has been instructed to snatch the microphone away from the President at the “inappropriate time of his choosing,” using it to mumble accolades about the Republicans’ “alternative plan.” “Although we don’t really have an ‘alternative plan,’” admitted Steele, “we told Kanye to just make one up.” West seems pleased with his new gig. “Although I voted for Obama, myself,” he said, “I’m honored to have been chosen to f**k up his speeches and s**t like that.” West looks forward to making a complete ass of himself when Obama speaks before the Nurses Association later in the week, telling reporters that while nurses perform an “important service for our country,” his friend Beyoncé would have “done a better job than any of them” had she chosen to become a nurse instead of an entertainer."
Budweiser Hires Congressman Wilson for ‘Rudest Man’ Commercials,996,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), who shot to fame by hollering “You lie!” during President Obama’s speech on healthcare, has been tapped to appear in a series of Budweiser commercials as the “Rudest Man in America.” The spots, a spoof of the Dos Equis “Most Interesting Man in the World” campaign, will depict Wilson as a savant-of-sorts, who shrieks the infamous two-word phrase at ads for competing ales. In one commercial, a narrator suggests that Coors Light is brewed with water “from the finest mountain streams.” Wilson shouts at his TV, “You lie!” Another spot has the Republican congressman surfing the Internet. An ad pops up, depicting a disheveled, overweight man who attracts a bevy of scantily clad beauties by offering a six pack of Corona Extra. Wilson bellows into his monitor, “You lie!” The ads end with am image of Wilson knocking back a can of Bud and belching into the camera. “The Rudest Man in America drinks Budweiser,” declares a narrator, “and that’s no lie!”"
"Obama to Enslave White People, Says GOP",2225,"NEW YORK — President Obama’s healthcare plan is a thinly veiled attempt to force all white people into slavery, according to conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. “We will not stand by as our sons and daughters are forced into involuntary servitude by this illegitimate Negro president,” said Beck on Wednesday’s edition of his Fox Television program. “Now is the time for Republicans to stand firm in the tradition of Abraham Lincoln and oppose ‘Obamalavery.’” Beck cited a Fox News poll that indicated 100% of white Americans oppose being sold into slavery. “The president has no support on his slavery agenda,” he said. “He is an unpopular president with unpopular ideas.” Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) agreed, calling Obama’s plan “outrageous,” and saying he has proposed legislation outlawing white slavery in the United States. Coburn’s anti-white slavery amendment was added to his “Domestic Animal Protection Bill,” which allows people to fire AK-47s at neighborhood cats and dogs. “The Domestic Animal Protection Bill guarantees our Second Amendment right to shoot things and kill them,” said Coburn.  “And now it will also ensure that you are not abducted from your home in the middle of the night, packed like sardines in the hull of a creaky 18th century cargo ship and sold to a wealthy black family who made their fortune during the Bush administration.” “If they try to enslave you and sell you at auction,” suggested Beck, “run!  Run as fast and far as your caucasion legs will allow. The welts on your back inflicted by Obama’s whips will hurt like the dickens, but you must not let the plantation owners utilize your backbreaking, sweat-making services without compensation.” Beck added, however, that plantation owners who utilize slave labor should not be mandated by the government to provide health insurance.  “You’re lucky to have a job in this economy,” he said. “Your welts will heal, but your employer is being taxed to death; having to provide you with healthcare will put him out of business, and his plantation will be sold at auction, along with my dear, beloved, white grandmother.” “The thought of my sweet grandma bending over to pick cotton in the hot sun,” he added, “is almost too unbearable.”"
Public Doubts ‘Official’ Account of Kennedy Death,1560,"BOSTON — Over 68% of Americans don’t believe the official government story that Senator Edward Kennedy died from a brain tumor, according to a survey released today. “It’s convenient to blame it all on cancer,” said researcher Johann Lipuidare, a public school custodian who runs several blogs on the Kennedy assassinations. “But there were three additional, unidentified diseases that actually dealt the fatal blow.” Lipuidare, who has called for a thorough investigation, claims at least two witnesses saw what they believed were two fatal viruses and a bacterium lingering around Kennedy’s hotel room on a trip to Hawaii in 2007. “Tropical islands are a breeding ground for deadly diseases,” said Lipuidare, who claims to have uncovered videotape of Kennedy’s personal physician “advising the senator that he didn’t need any vaccinations prior to his trip.” Although Lipuidare doesn’t think the government was involved in the senator’s death, if Kennedy were killed by three disparate microbes, why would authorities conspire to cover it up with a “preposterous” brain tumor story? “If Americans knew that a conspiracy of contagions murdered their beloved senator,” he explained, “the resulting mass panic would thwart the government’s own conspiracy to inoculate citizens with the deadly N1H1 Swine Flu vaccine.” The question remains, however, as to a motive for the assassination. Lipuidare thinks he knows the answer. “Senator Kennedy was the nation’s strongest advocate for government healthcare reform,” he said. “The diseases needed to take him down.”"
Insurance Lobby Denies Pay to Heckler Due to ‘Pre-Existing Ignorance’,1251,"BOZEMAN, MT (TheSkunk.org) — A powerful insurance lobby today denied compensation to a man it hired to disrupt a town hall meeting on healthcare reform, asserting that he had “pre-existing ignorance.” A spokesperson for the Insurance Lobby of America said they hired Milo Gunther to interrupt his congressman’s town hall meeting by shouting out ridiculous statements and unsupported claims, but later discovered that Gunther had a track record of touting “screwy shit” to people all his life. “Gunther never disclosed that he had previously declared public transportation to be a socialist government takeover,” said a spokesperson for the lobby, “or that Americans will be required to have their phone numbers tattooed on their foreheads.” The ILA also uncovered a letter Gunther had written to the Bozeman Tribune, asserting that the moon landing was faked, John F. Kennedy is alive and living in a retirement home with Elvis Presley on an island owned by Ashton Kutcher, and aliens are living inside his rectum. “Under the Heckler’s Agreement Mr. Gunther entered into with our organization,” explained the spokesperson, “the pre-existence of ignorant assertions he made prior to the ones we asked him to deliver disqualifies him from compensation.”"
Palin Baby to Be Sacrificed to Volcano Gods,1246,"JUNEAU, AK — Sniglet Palin, three-year-old daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, is scheduled to be thrown into Mt. Redoubt, a 10,197-foot active volcano 103 miles west of Anchorage, to please the fire gods. “We’re not going to wait until she’s euthanized by some ‘Death Panel’ created under Obama’s evil healthcare plan,” said the former Republican Vice Presidential nominee. “If anyone is to take the life of a child, it should be the parents.” The sacrifice, scheduled for Saturday at noon, will include prominent Republican politicians and donors. “We’ve asked Rush Limbaugh to say a little prayer to the gods before we toss little Sniglet to them,” said Palin, “so that the citizens of Alaska can be blessed with bountiful fishing.” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), has expressed his admiration for the Palin family. “The Obama healthcare plan would disallow families from sacrificing their own offspring to the gods of their choice,” he said in a CNN interview. “We don’t need government telling us how or when to snuff out our children; I trust the American people in figuring that out for themselves.” Media access will be limited, with FOX NEWS expected to be the only broadcast outlet allowed to cover the event."
Obama Regrets Use of Term ‘Douche Bag’ in Reference to Elderly Crosssing Guard,3260,"WASHINGTON, DC — In an interview on Face the Nation, President Obama regretted using the term “douche bag” when referring to a local 80-year-old crossing guard. The President, trying to diffuse the situation and redirect attention back to his healthcare plan, said he used an unfortunate selection of words and could have “calibrated them differently,” but stopped short of offering an apology. He briefly considered using the term “geriatric piece-of-crap,” according to White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, but thought it might come across as too elitist. The incident that sparked the controversy occurred on Friday, when Obama’s daughter Malia was walking home from grade school, accompanied by two Secret Service agents. As they arrived at the corner, Safety Officer Marlene Toomey, who has been a crossing guard for fifty-eight years, instructed the trio not to enter the crosswalk until she blew her whistle. Ignoring her directives, the Secret Service agents prematurely escorted the ten-year-old across the intersection before Mrs. Toomey could even hold up her stop sign, inciting her to strike one of them over the head with the hard edge of the red wooden octagon. The agent suffered a mild concussion. “Although she acted like a complete pinhead,” said the President, “it was a poor choice of words, and I could have expressed my opinion of that wheezing gag of phlegm in a more thoughtful manner.” Mrs. Toomey refused to apologize for her actions, saying she acted in accordance with the traditional standards for decrepit little old ladies harassed in crosswalks. “He’s lucky I didn’t hit him with my purse,” she said. “I got a big bottle of Pepto in there.” The injured Secret Service agent, who has since recovered, said he is mostly to blame for the misunderstanding. “I was wearing my ear buds, listening to Michael Jackson,” he admitted. “I wasn’t paying much attention to that hobbling corpse or her pathetic little red sign.” The National Crossing Guard Association released a statement in support of Mrs. Toomey, saying that the President’s words were “an insult to all the dementia-riddled, foul-smelling, antiquated crossing guards throughout the country, who each day put the safety of our children on the line with their poor vision and sluggish reflexes.” Vice President Biden was sent in for damage control. Speaking to a group of AARP members, he rattled off a number of alternate expressions the President could have used. “He could have called her a ‘Crazy Alzheimer’s Lady,’” said Biden, “or a ‘Washed up coffin whore,’ a ‘Shit smelling sack of crackling witch bones,’ a ‘Stanky crack,’  a ‘Cranky stank,’ ‘Crusty cane poo,’ or even an ‘Old pod of dangly flesh’ – but the President chose to take the high road.” He added that in the collective sea of epithets, the one Obama used really wasn’t so bad. “The White House gets letters all the time addressed to ‘Douche Bag,’” explained the Vice President. “The mail room likes to forward them to me.” President Obama hopes some good might arise from the controversy. “By verbally bitch-slapping that frail octogenarian,” he told reporters, “we’ve opened the doors to dialog between white, black and all those aging curmudgeons who are adding trillions to my healthcare plan.”"
Obama Kills Elk with Bare Hands,1920,"YELLOWSTONE — The response to President Obama’s swatting of a fly with his open palm during an NBC interview was so overwhelming, it prompted him to seek out other animals to kill with his bare hands. Surrounded by the press, the President ventured into Yellowstone National Park, where he came upon a herd of elk grazing in a field. “Watch this,” he told reporters, as he snuck up behind a quiet female, clenched his powerful hands around its neck and tightened his grasp until its vertebrae cracked with an audible snap. “He doesn’t have healthcare,” quipped the President. The reporters laughed and applauded as the animal’s lifeless carcass fell to the ground. Obama smiled as he asked the park ranger if there were any mountain lions nearby. No cougars had been seen that morning, so the ranger escorted the President and his entourage to Yellowstone Lake, where they discovered a family of otters playing on a rock about twenty feet from the shore.  Obama waded into the lake, fully clothed. The water level approached his chin, as he carefully drew near the skittish mammals. Frightened, the otters jumped into the water, but Obama dove in after them.  He emerged moments later with the baby otter clenched firmly in his teeth.  He grabbed it by its tail and swung it high over his head before slamming it forcefully onto the rock.  It lay there, motionless, its two dark marble eyes staring blankly at the sky. “That otter do it,” joked the President, to the delight of the reporters. He was about to swim back to the shore, when something darted by him in the water. He jabbed his hand into lake and — in a flash — pulled out a giant cutthroat trout. He threw the fish toward the reporters, who responded with more laughter and applause. “Thanks guys,” said Obama, as he boarded Marine One. “See you in D.C.” The helicopter took off, transporting the President to the National Zoo for his next press conference."
