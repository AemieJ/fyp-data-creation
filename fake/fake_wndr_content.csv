JAPANESE PM DRINKS WATER FROM FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR PLANT TO REASSURE WORLD THAT RADIATION IS ‘SAFE AND TASTY’,1077,"The Japanese Prime Minister has been on the defensive since it was revealed that Japan will release over one million tonnes of treated radioactive water from the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. Environmentalist organizations worldwide, as well as concerned citizens of Japan and neighboring countries, have criticized the move yet PM Yoshihide Suga has remained inflexible on the question. The World Health Organization has warned that the melted uranium fuel rods release tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that can raise cancer risks, and allege accumulated doses over time could damage DNA. “I have been drinking this water for days now and I feel great. Who are you going to believe? A bunch of bureaucrats at the World Health Organization or your Prime Minister?” Yoshihide Suga added while denying the allegations. One Japanese water bottling company in a bid to seize the hype generated by the radioactive water has said that it has landed an exclusive deal with the Fukushima plant and will offer bottled radioactive water as soon as July."
"PORN STAR CLAIMS ‘DAILY FACIAL CUM SHOTS’ CAN REDUCE SPREAD OF COVID-19, OFFERS BETTER PROTECTION THAN MASKS",958,"Yelena Vokstroykya, an actress in the adult entertainment industry that has an impressive 1,3 million followers on various social media outlets, claims daily facial cum shots are the reason she has not contracted the deadly virus. Vokstroykya based her testimony on an obscure Russian 2016 study which showed that most viruses cannot survive on dried semen. Vokstroykya’s claims that daily facial cum shots offer better protection than masks from COVID-19 have raised many eyebrows, but although she admits facing backlash from the scientific community, she sticks to her claim. “Many scientists don’t know anything about science. What I offer is a free cure that can save millions of lives. If scientists don’t believe in the truth, that is not my problem,” she added. Vokstroykya is also allegedly working on an upcoming line of semen-based skin products with the help of her boyfriend that she says should be available for purchase in the upcoming months."
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYS COVID-19 UNLIKELY TO HAVE LEAKED FROM CHINESE PENIS ENLARGEMENT FACILITY,934,"The Wuhan-based penis enlargement facility, the biggest in the country, made headlines in December of 2019 when several test subjects were declared COVID-19 positive. Yinjing Power International, a Chinese-based company specializing in penis enlargement solutions, has denied being the source of the coronavirus epidemic after openly admitting to the use of bat semen as an ingredient in their products. Health officials nationwide were alarmed last year after reports of YPI test subjects allegedly being injected intravenously with bat semen had developed symptoms similar to the coronavirus. “My toes, fingers, and penis become all blue. Hair grow on my back and eyelids. I hear voices of dead people,” one anonymous test subject recounted in horror, detailing several side effects. World Health Organization experts believe the coronavirus has spread from animal to human contact but have yet to discover the origins of the virus."
NEW ZEALAND FARMER JAILED AFTER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTING CORONAVIRUS TO FLOCK OF 400 SHEEP,1151,"Jeremiah Wilson, 37, alerted health authorities last week after being hospitalized for symptoms of the coronavirus and admitting to hospital staff to having sexual relations with his flock of 400 sheep but not his wife who has since tested negative to the coronavirus. Coronavirus has been known to spread to several species of animals but health officials have confirmed that sheep cannot contract the virus by other means than sexual transmission. When questioned by journalists if it was safe for farmers to resume such sexual activities with the animals after the pandemic, Health Ministry spokesman Jarod Wellshire was reassuring. “These practices have been ongoing for centuries and have never represented a health threat for the population until today,” Health Ministry spokesman Jarod Wellshire added. Last year, hundreds of thousands of sheep all over New Zealand were euthanized after being transmitted the virus through “unknown means” according to the Ministry of Health. Bestiality is illegal in New Zealand but is openly tolerated by police authorities in rural regions where such activities are culturally accepted according to experts."
500-POUND MAN SPREAD CORONAVIRUS TO 372 PASSENGERS AFTER WET FARTING IN AIRPLANE ON FLIGHT TO CANCUN,950,"Henry Collins, 42, was on a flight towards Cancun when he was unexpectedly hit by what he describes as “extreme diarrhea” which was later identified as COVID-19. Collins who already suffers from chronic flatulence due to his morbid obesity claims he had no control over his diarrhea which spread accidentally onto several passengers. Collins was rapidly helped by three flight attendants who had to wipe his body clean because he was unable to do so by himself before being secluded to the bathroom for several hours after the incident. “I’ve been to war-torn Iraq and Afghanistan. I’ve seen people blown up and shred to pieces. But I was not prepared for this,” one army veteran admitted to reporters, still visibly traumatized. After several passengers were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, American Airlines said it would offer psychological help free of charge to all of its passengers and flight attendants who attended the flight."
UTAH FAMILY CLAIMS 15-YEAR-OLD SON TURNED GAY AFTER 5G CELL PHONE TOWER WAS INSTALLED NEAR HOME,1064,"Thomas McGuire, 45, and his wife Caroll McGuire, 41, noticed that their son was “behaving abnormally” only weeks after a 5G cell tower was installed next to their home. The McGuire family say their son started listening to “queer music” such as David Bowie, Prince, and the Back Street Boys in the weeks following the apparition of the 5G tower as well as using make-up and dressing in an “effeminate way.” Conspiracy theorists believe 5G towers can have disruptive effects on human health but could also be used by companies and governments for mind control and mind reading. “I have never been a conspiracy nut, except maybe for that fake moon landing hoax and, of course, 911 being an inside job, but my son’s homosexual symptoms have been well documented by 5G experts all over the world,” the teenager’s father added. Although experts believe that the fears around 5G causing homosexual tendencies are grossly overblown, one 2019 French study did show that 5G radio frequencies did increase the online consumption of male pornography in several test subjects."
11-YEAR-OLD GIRL HOSPITALIZED AFTER KISSING HUNDREDS OF FROGS IN SEARCH OF PRINCE CHARMING,961,"Apparently, the young girl took the story of the frog prince too literally, believing she would eventually find her prince charming by kissing hundreds of frogs. In doing so, medical staff at Baptist Medical Center South explained that the young girl exposed herself to chemicals that reside in frogs and toads skins’, called bufotoxins, which led her to develop an extreme skin rash over several months. The girl’s symptoms have not only spread to her face but also to her tongue, throat, and trachea, heavily impacting breathing conditions according to medical staff. “The young woman described how she would ‘french kiss’ the animals by inserting her tongue fully inside the frog’s mouth, which could explain the inflammation in the trachea area,” Dr. Patterson added. In 2018, the Mexican government banned the traditional Aztec practice of licking frogs as a libido enhancer after a nationwide poll revealed that one in two Mexicans practiced frog-licking."
MORGUE EMPLOYEE CONTRACTED CORONAVIRUS AFTER SEX WITH INFECTED CORPSES,1060,"Damien Cole, 29, was forced to admit to Western Massachusetts Hospital staff that he indulged in sexual intercourse with several male and female corpses at his workplace after he complained suffering from a severe fever. Cole also admitted to partaking in oral and anal sex as well as unprotected genital sexual interactions with the deceased. Damien Cole’s girlfriend was also admitted to Western Massachusetts Hospital shortly after she tested positive to the coronavirus. “I was aware of his sexual activities at work but he kept arguing that sleeping with dead people isn’t technically like cheating” Cole’s girlfriend, Elisa Wood, 16, admitted to reporters when reached by phone. Damien Cole could face several criminal charges for negligence as he knowingly had sexual interactions with cadavers infected with the coronavirus and transmitted the disease to others. Cole should not face any charges for necrophilia according to legal experts as partaking in sexual intercourse with a dead body is a common and legal practice in the state of Massachusetts."
COVID-19 OUTBREAK AT LAS VEGAS STRIP CLUB AFTER STRIPPER SQUIRTED VAGINAL FLUIDS ONTO EIGHTEEN CLIENTS,988,"Helen “Bunny” Lagrande, 26, and eighteen clients of the Red Baron, a local Las Vegas strip club, have been hospitalized after a Friday night performance. Lagrande performs her squirting show 3 times a week but it appears that she lost control that night and accidentally sprayed several clients. One eyewitness also reported that the vaginal fluids spread onto several clients’ faces, eyes, and mouths, possibly facilitating the infection. “I was sitting in the front row and got the full blast of the squirt. Doctors said it went down my throat and directly into my lungs” one hospitalized client told reporters. The Red Baron administrators say they have now defined new sanitary protocols to prevent and direct vaginal fluids such as the use of a large straw and/or garden hose. Last week a similar event occurred in the area after six clients were infected with the coronavirus when a strip club dancer with diarrhea symptoms accidentally defecated onto several clients during a show."
OHIO MAN HAS MIRACULOUS RECOVERY AFTER CONTRACTING COVID-19 DURING SEX WITH INFECTED DOG,997,"James O’Keefe, 53, was volunteering at a local animal shelter when he contracted the coronavirus during an alleged sexual interaction with one of the animals. O’Keefe claims he was unaware at the time that domestic pets such as cats and dogs could transmit the virus and hopes to warn others not to walk in his footsteps. O’Keefe claims that he has been depressed for several years since his girlfriend left him in 2012 and that this led him to unleash his sexual fantasies on animals at the shelter. “If I can save only one life by sharing my story and help people restrain from having sex with their domestic pets at least until the pandemic is over, it will all have been worth it” O’Keefe added. Bestiality is not a crime in the state of Ohio and James O’Keefe does not face any criminal charges at the moment. All 230 animals at the animal shelter where James O’Keefe was a volunteer, and allegedly contracted the virus, have been euthanized for public safety have assured public authorities."
SAN FRANCISCO EPIDEMIOLOGIST WARNS CORONAVIRUS CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH ANAL SEX,906,"Epidemiologist Jude Perkins at University of California San Francisco analyzed feces samples of 138 COVID-19 patients and found the presence of the virus in 95% of them. According to the research team, COVID-19’s scatological impact on those who regularly practice sodomy has been completely neglected since the spread of the disease. To confirm their findings, the research team sought the help of two hundred volunteers who sent feces samples as well as video recordings of themselves practicing the act of sodomy and defecating to ensure the quality of the results. “The San Francisco community has been extremely helpful during the whole process that led to the results of this research,” assured Dr. Jude Perkins. Dr. Perkins now hopes to study the effects of other popular sexual practices of the SF community and their impact on the spread of COVID-19 such as bondage, facial cum shots, and fisting."
NASA EXPERT PART OF SETI PROGRAM CLAIMS ALIENS TRIED TO WARN US ABOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,1258,"The director of data analysis and decryption of the Berkeley SETI Research Center, 46-year old Professor Nancy McMurray, claims her team has identified a series of repetitive signals among their collected data that appear to be a kind of extraterrestrial warning signal. Each signal is composed of the exact same variation of 23 radio frequencies, emitted in the same order, and each lasting the exact same duration for a total of 4.48 seconds in all. According to Professor McMurray, a total of 17 of these identical signals were intercepted over a period going from September 4 to November 29, 2019. The decryption specialist and her team analyzed the signals and determined they were probably a kind of warning message based on an alien mathematical language similar to the Morse Code. Professor McMurray’s claims have generated a lot of reactions throughout the scientific community. While several scientists have saluted the “discovery” of the signals their possible implications for humanity, several academics have also criticized his translation as “hazardous at best”. Several universities and space agencies have made official demands to obtain copies of the signals, but the Berkeley SETI Research Center has yet to share any of its research data."
SAN FRANCISCO: THOUSANDS INFECTED BY CORONAVIRUS AFTER HOMELESS MAN DEFECATED IN DRINKING FOUNTAIN,851,"Thousands of San Francisco residents could have been infected after drinking from a water fountain that a homeless man contaminated with COVID-19, said health authorities yesterday. The homeless man apparently used the drinking fountain as a bidet to wash himself off after defecating in the street. San Francisco police also said they had arrested the man after samples of urine, excrements, and semen were found in the fountain. “Masturbating, urinating and defecating in public drinking fountains should not be encouraged or practiced by San Francisco residents and are considered a health hazard to the community,” SF police Chief Andrew Simmons warned. San Francisco is struggling to accommodate the thousands of homeless who have limited access to public restrooms, as complaints regarding human feces have increased exponentially in past years."
COVID-19: AFGHAN GOVERNMENT FORCES WOMEN TO WEAR THREE LAYERS OF BURQAS TO STOP THE CONTAGION,1296,"The Afghan Health Minister, Dr. Ferozuddin Feroz, announced a new set of restrictive measures for the population to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the country. Among these measures, the government has imposed on Afghan women the obligation to wear a minimum of three layers of burqas when in public, announcing fines of up to 20,000 Afghanis (262 US dollars) and 50 lashes for any violations. Dr. Feroz says this measure is meant to limit the propagation of the disease and protect women. Dr. Feroz explained that one burqa is clearly insufficient to protect its wearer, so that is why he decided to impose a minimum of three. Several Women’s Rights organizations have denounced the measure as misogynistic. In a brief press statement, the International Council of Women (ICW) criticized the Afghan government for “putting the responsibility of stopping the pandemic on Afghan women’s shoulders”. The Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (often called UN Women), Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, also denounced the measure. In a brief communiqué, the head of UN Women said her organization would remain extremely vigilant as “some governments are using the pandemic to push their own political agendas through their restrictive measures.”"
"MEXICO: WOMAN INFECTED WITH COVID-19 GIVES BIRTH TO TWINS, NAMES THEM CORONA AND VIRUS",832,"Annamaria José Raphael Gonzalez, 34, gave birth to twins while she was infected with the coronavirus at Hospital General La Villa in Mexico City. Gonzalez gave birth to two healthy babies at approximately 2 am this morning, a girl named Corona José Miguel Gonzalez and a boy named Virus José Miguel Gonzalez. Annamaria Gonzalez had planned to give birth in the United States next week but was forced into labor before she could reach the border. “I knew I was infected with COVID-19 but I wanted to give my children a chance to have a U.S. citizenship by crossing the border,” she told reporters. In 2017, a Mexican mother named one of her children Malaria after she had been diagnosed with the disease and in 2018 another woman named her daughter Gonorrea, after being cured of a severe episode of the sexually transmitted disease."
COVID-19: CHINESE HEALTH AUTHORITIES CONFIRM PATIENT ZERO ‘HAD SEX WITH BATS’,930,"Yin Dao Tang, 24, from the province of Hubei, is the first case of the novel coronavirus that emerged on November 17, according to Chinese government data. Tang is believed to have contracted the disease after indulging in sexual acts with several animals, including bats. Chinese officials have warned to temporarily abstain from having sexual contact with any animals, especially with bats. “We ask the population to abstain temporarily from oral, genital or anal sexual contact with animals, especially bats,” Chinese officials warned citizens yesterday. The Chinese government said it would consider fines and prison time to enforce that the population temporarily abstains from sexual contact with animals until the pandemic is fully controlled. China’s millennial-old cultural traditions have made the bat a synonym of healthy sexual appetite, longevity, good eyesight and luck and are a popular dish in the region of Hubei."
SPANISH AUTHORITIES ASK PREGNANT WOMEN TO ABSTAIN FROM GIVING BIRTH UNTIL THE END OF THE PANDEMIC,1184,"Health Minister Salvador Illa announced the closure of several schools and colleges and announced the cancellation of sports and cultural event this morning, before admonishing the population for not respecting the government’s directives. Mr. Illa argued that much of the Spanish healthcare system is taken up by people with other problems than the Covid-19, seriously limiting the country’s capacity to fight the virus. The Health Minister claimed reminded pregnant women that hospitals are dangerous places for infections at the moment and asked them to delay their visits “as long as possible”. Spain, like several European countries, is struggling to control the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of deaths and hospitalizations has been increasing dramatically over the last two weeks, putting extreme pressure on the country’s health system. The authorities have already shut down several services to concentrate resources on fighting the epidemics. They notably stopped esthetic surgery,  treatments for mental problems, erectile problems or sexually transmitted diseases. According to experts, many more services could be closed over the next few weeks, including maternity wards."
"‘CORONAVIRUS HASN’T CHANGED MY LIFE A BIT,’ SAYS MAN WHO HAS LIVED IN BUBBLE SUIT SINCE CHILDHOOD",874,"Alan Montgomery, 48, was diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) when he turned 5 years old and has since been forced to live in a specially constructed sterile plastic bubble. Although Alan Montgomery’s doctors believe that a treatment he has received in 1984 has cured him of his disease, Alan has always chosen to stay protected from his environment. Montgomery claims that life in a plastic bubble has not always been easy, especially during his teenage years. “Trying to hook up with girls in high school was dreadful. I won’t go into too many details but let’s just say my first sexual relationship was pretty awkward,” he admits. Alan Montgomery’s suit allows him to ingest liquid foods through intravenous feeding as well as urinate and defecate through plastic and rubber tubes connected to his rectum and genitals, allowing him to be 100% germ-free."
MAN HOSPITALIZED AFTER DRINKING 16 GALLONS OF HAND SANITIZER TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM CORONAVIRUS,1095,"Jimmy Eduardo Jesus Gonzalez, 26, was transported by ambulance after calling 9-1-1 and informing the emergency dispatcher that he “felt unwell” after drinking over 122 bottles of Purell hand sanitizer during a 72-hour period. Gonzalez also washed his whole body with hand sanitizer as well as brushed his teeth with the antibacterial product several times a day during at least one week prior to him calling 9-1-1. Jimmy Gonzalez claims he suffered from fever and respiratory problems after ingesting the product. “I called the hospital because I thought that I had coronavirus symptoms, but when they learned that I had drunk 16 gallons or more of hand sanitizer they told me to call an ambulance,” Gonzalez added. Doctors say that Gonzalez may have developed an addiction to the product as he has admitted to having cravings for the product and was caught drinking a bottle at the hospital by a nurse. A similar incident occurred last week when a Crystal meth and heroin user in Illinois injected hand sanitizer in his eyes to protect himself from the coronavirus but was instead hospitalized."
"MAN ARRESTED AT THE FRANCE-GERMANY BORDER FOR SMUGGLING 2,500 SURGICAL MASKS IN HIS RECTAL CAVITY",1404,"The shortages caused by the coronavirus are driving certain people to try and profit from the rising prices of certain goods like toilet paper, hand sanitizer and surgical masks. 47-year old François von Bitemole, from Strasbourg, works for a German surgical mask factory and travels across the border every day on his scooter to go to work. According to the French National Gendarmerie spokesman, Colonel Alain Meloche, the accused decided to profit from the shortage in his home country by stealing a few thousand masks every workday from his employer and smuggling them back to France to sell them. Colonel Meloche says the accused had already sold over 8,000 masks across the region, but the vast majority were retrieved before being worn. Mr. von Bitemole will be accused of facilitating the irregular entry of goods in France and of criminal endangerment of the life of 24 people. If found guilty, he faces 15 years in jail and a fine of €125,000. According to the Gendarmerie, other arrests are to be expected as the black market for certain first necessity goods has rapidly spawned all across Europe. Several street gangs in Paris and Marseilles have apparently expanded their drug trafficking operations to sell toilet paper and disposable masks. The European health authorities warn against buying such black market items from street dealers as some of them may be contaminated or counterfeit."
ITALY: 21-YEAR-OLD MAN CURED HIMSELF OF COVID-19 BY DRINKING HIS OWN SEMEN,971,"Francesco Linguini, 21, says he confined himself to his room after showing apparent symptoms associated with COVID-19. He immediately took to the internet to find a cure and eventually found out that human sperm was one of the world’s most potent antibacterial agents. Although most experts are skeptical of Linguini’s claims, the young man is ready for doctors to make a vaccine from his sperm if Italian health officials are interested to examine his claims. “If my sperm can save humanity from COVID-19 by making some sort of vaccine or pill from my sperm, I am willing to submit my body to science,” he told reporters. Linguini said that his parents were very supportive throughout the whole ordeal and brought him food, toilet paper, and a bucket to make his confinement easier. When interviewed by journalists, Francesco Linguini’s mother denied several reporters accusations’ that her son was, in fact, a homosexual, or that he was encouraging homosexual behavior."
PAPUA NEW GUINEA: ENTIRE CANNIBAL TRIBE CATCHES CORONAVIRUS AFTER EATING INFECTED CHINESE PROSPECTOR,1639,"A total of 14 members of the Korowai tribe have died and 87 others have tested positive to the Covid-19 virus over the last two weeks, over a population of 118. After several days of thorough investigation, the governmental authorities believe they may finally have found the reason for the mysterious contamination of this extremely isolated tribe. Several members of the tribe said they became sick after eating the “yellow evil spirit”. According to Lt. James Manning of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, the country’s national police, this could explain the disappearance of 57-year old Chinese engineer Wu Jing in the region at the end of February. The prospector for the Zijin Mining Group was reported missing on February 28, only four days after arriving from China. Only the children under age twelve were spared as they were not allowed by tradition to participate in cannibalistic rituals. The Korowai tribe is one of the last known tribes in the world to still practice cannibalism. They believe it is necessary to kill and eat a person whom they believe has been taken over by a khakua, a kind of evil spirit or demon. This violent and gruesome custom may have caused their loss in the end, as the tribe’s witch doctor was powerless against the coronavirus and was one of the first victims to succumb to the disease. Several members of the tribe are severely ill, but their isolation makes it impossible for them to be transported to the hospital, The Papuan government has promised to send doctors and pharmaceuticals to help them cope with the pandemic but fears the Korowai could be totally wiped out by the disease."
MAN HOSPITALIZED AFTER HE BELIEVED EATING TOILET PAPER COULD CURE HIM FROM CORONAVIRUS,930,"Jeremy Glasgow, 34, saw a number of reports about the coveted item which led him to believe people were eating the toilet paper as an antivirus. His mother, Sue Ellen Glasgow, 67, also believed the hype around toilet paper was meant to be a cure to the virus but did not indulge in the precious commodity. It is believed Glasgow ingested an estimated 164 rolls of toilet paper during a three-day period, according to the mother’s bank receipts. “Some people may find it funny that I believed that toilet paper would cure me, but even though I’m hospitalized for other reasons, I am coronavirus free, so there might be something to it after all,” Glasgow added. Doctors at Vicksburg’s Promise Hospital say that Jeremy is suffering from extreme constipation but should recover swiftly. There are currently several potential cures to the coronavirus at the moment believe health authorities, but toilet paper is not one, say experts."
"OHIO: HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS FIGHT OVER TOILET PAPER IN A WALMART STORE; 3 DEAD, 174 INJURED, 213 ARRESTS",1178,"The coronavirus pandemics is leading more and more Americans to stockpile certain goods like masks, hand sanitizers and now, toilet paper. A horde of several hundred panicked people literally stormed the Walmart store in Columbus this morning to stock up for the quarantine. Things rapidly turned violent as goods like toilet paper and spaghetti started running out only ten minutes after the opening. Jim Thompson, one of the store’s security guard who witnessed the whole scene, says dozens of fights broke out in less than a minute. Mr. Thompson says that hundreds of bloodied customers were lying on the floor and dozens were still fighting when the Colombus Police Department crowd control unit arrived fifteen minutes later. Three people died and a total of 174 others had to be transported to hospitals across the region, 23 of which are in critical conditions. 213 customers were also arrested under various charges, a number which could go up over the next hours according to the Columbus Police Department. In a brief press release, the CPD asked the population to remain calm and promised increased police presence in retail stores for the duration of the quarantine."
A COUPLE OF “VIRUS RIGHTS” ACTIVISTS VOLUNTARILY CATCHES CORONAVIRUS TO SAVE IT FROM W.H.O. GENOCIDE,1717,"Jason and Kelly Dawson from Seattle, are members of a radical splinter group called Defenders of All Life (DAL), who broke off from PETA in 2018. Firmly convinced that the covid-19 virus was created by God and should be allowed to live like all of God’s creations, the couple was horrified by the vast and well-coordinated efforts deployed by the World Health Organization to exterminate it. The couple decided to leave their jobs and use their savings to try as hard as they could to catch the virus and save it from extinction. In an interview via Facetime, Mr. Dawson described their three-week trip through the four infected countries. Kelly Dawson said she knew the first part of their mission was accomplished when they began feeling ill after three days in Italy. The couple was able to return home via Spain and Mexico and now hope to get confirmation that they are infected by the coronavirus and not just the flu or other disease. Virus Rights activism remains a marginal movement but it seems to be gaining popularity among some Christian groups as well as far-left environmental activists. Many of them argue that viruses just want to live and reproduce, just like humans and animals, and that deliberately and methodically exterminating other lifeforms, even viruses or bacterias, constitutes a genocide. The Defenders of Life claim that their members’ choice to carry viruses is a political action protected by their constitutional rights, but the American law and jurisprudence refute the DoL’s claims. The HHS confirmed that the couple had been tested for the coronavirus and could be arrested and placed in forced quarantine if they are found positive and should refuse to cooperate with authorities."
CHINESE DOCTOR WARNS ONLY WAY TO ERADICATE CORONAVIRUS IS TO “STOP HAVING SEX WITH CHICKENS”,1041,"Li Ping Wang, leading epidemiologist at Beijing University believes the Wuhan coronavirus has developed through interspecies sexual intercourse and that this practice must be discontinued to end the outbreak. Wang went on national television yesterday to warn the Chinese population and the rest of the world of the origin and potential cure for the life-threatening epidemic. The cultural practice of sexual intercourse with chickens to ward off evil spirits, promote crop growth and cure erectile dysfunction is a widely held belief and commonly practiced in many regions of the country have acknowledged experts. “These traditions have been upheld for millennia and it will be hard for the Chinese people to stop indulging in such activities” Chinese cultural expert, Nathan Daniels explained. Other medical experts had previously warned that the Wuhan Jī Jian Jie (also known as the Wuhan Chicken Rape Festival) which has been held for centuries in the region to ward off evil spirits could be at the origin of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak."
"BURGLAR SNORTS DRIED SPERM THINKING IT WAS COCAINE, CONTRACTS HERPES AND SYPHILIS",1625,"29-year old Jerry Smith was arrested on Wednesday for a series of burglaries committed over the last year across Northern Florida. During his interrogation, he admitted that one of his crimes hadn’t turned out as expected, leading him to develop at least three different STDs. The young man then fell apart, crying like a baby, and explained he had snorted large quantities of semen he had stolen a few weeks ago, believing it was either cocaine or heroin. It took deputies a few hours to corroborate his confession and they were finally able to find the corresponding police report. The victim, 34-year old Jenny White, returned to her Silver Springs Shores apartment last month to discover that several sex toys and accessories as well a collection of pornographic movies were missing. Ms. White, a hard time Tinder user, also reported a very unique item stolen: a crystal jar containing semen from hundreds of her sexual partners. The young woman says she wondered why the thief took her semen jar and was astonished when the sheriff deputies told her he had snorted it.   Some could say that Jerry Smith has already paid for his crime by developing both oral and genital herpes, as well as an extremely violent strain of the syphilis virus, but he still has to face another kind of punishment. He now faces a total of 17 criminal charges including burglary, receipt of stolen property, possession of fake identification cards, and drug possession. If found guilty on all charges, he faces a total of 65 years in prison and a fine of $455,000. His trial should start in December at Marion County Judicial Center, in Ocala."
VEGAN WOMAN HAD UNPROTECTED SEX WITH DOZENS OF BUTCHERS TO GIVE THEM AIDS,964,"Janelle Flower, 26, a cook at a San Francisco vegan restaurant and member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was arrested this week after San Francisco police received a number of complaints. Flower allegedly would seduce workers in the meat industry, have unprotected sex with them, and leave them a note in the morning telling them they had AIDS. All 37 current known victims have all undergone HIV testing and all results were found to be negative according to San Francisco police. “Janelle Flower was possibly misdiagnosed with HIV since she suffers from severe malnutrition which may have been interpreted by doctors as an immunodeficient response similar to HIV,” one San Francisco police spokesman added during the press conference. Californian law previously punished people who intentionally exposed or infected others with HIV by up to eight years in prison, but since 2017 legislation now lowers jail time to a maximum of six months."
MUSEUM EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS 150-MILLION-YEAR-OLD STD AFTER SEX WITH STEGOSAURUS EGG,1108,"Adam Weinstein, 23, was hospitalized last week after suffering from symptoms usually associated with syphilis, such as loss of eyesight, coughing blood, and swollen genitals. Weinstein admittedly told his doctor that he had inserted his genitals inside a stegosaurus egg at his workplace because he was depressed and sexually frustrated since his girlfriend left him several weeks before the incident. The employee’s warm semen might have triggered some form of biological reaction which brought the dinosaur-era bacteria out of its 150-million-year-long somnolence, one scientist explained. “Not all bacteria can come back to life after being dormant for millions of years. Syphilis bacteria can do so because they form spores, which are extremely hardy and can survive dormant for hundreds of thousands or millions of years,” paleobiologist Hans Mueller believes. In 2006, a team of Russian scientists revived an Anthrax bacterium that had been lying dormant in ice, beneath the surface of a glacier for 8-million-years and which led to the death of an estimated 200,000 reindeers and 230 nearby villagers."
SAN FRANCISCO HOMELESS MAN DIES FROM RABIES AFTER PERFORMING ORAL SEX ON STRAY DOG,1111,"Bernard John Fellman, 56, was arrested last week and charged with public indecency and lewdness after partaking in sexual activities with a dog in a San Francisco public park. B.J. Fellman had previously been arrested by the San Francisco police on multiple occasions for urinating and defecating in public, although he was never formally charged and was exempted from paying any fines. San Francisco police officers were dispatched on the scene after a number of complaints were made. Eye witness testimonies also indicate that the man had spread what appeared to be peanut butter on his genitals to lure the animal to him. “The man had no pants on and the dog was licking his genitals and then he grabbed the dog’s penis and shoved it into his mouth. It is an image I will be stuck with for the rest of my life,” one onlooker admitted, visibly horrified. A San Francisco police spokesman said that although similar occurrences are rare, it is important for the population to “avoid interactions with stray animals which carry a variety of diseases” and to “refrain from any sexual activity with them as well.”"
TEXAS: 14-YEAR-OLD BOY MIRACULOUSLY CURED OF HOMOSEXUALITY AFTER ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY,1204,"The new experimental electroshock therapy, which originates from China where the treatment takes place in public, government-run hospitals and in private clinics, is the first of its kind to be performed on the American soil. Doctors at the Dallas Baptist Hospital have allegedly seen major progress in the young man’s behavior, claiming that his “homosexual urges” have also undergone a dramatic drop. Dr. Erich von Eisenstein explained that the therapy can sometimes cause “important neurological disorders” but that these are “temporary” and can be explained by the high-frequency voltage applied to the brain tissue through the scalp of the patient. “Through induction, this new technology can transmit high-frequency voltage of up to 35 000 volts at a time during an extremely short period calculated in milliseconds, and which, if prolonged, would cause permanent brain damage or even death,” warned Dr. Eiseintein. The former leader of the People’s Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, was a fierce proponent of electroshock therapy treatment which he encouraged during China’s cultural revolution, a period during which homosexuality was declared a “mental illness” and a “capitalist disease.”"
MAN SUES STRIP CLUB WHERE HE CONTRACTED SYPHILIS AFTER LICKING DANCE POLE,912,"The Oregon Herald reported Thursday that Mike Litte, 28, is seeking $500,000 in damages from the Apollo strip club. During the performance, one dancer apparently “squirted” on the dance pole, which Litte decided to lick before suffering from symptoms of syphilis days later. Andrew Smith, Mike Litte’s lawyer, believes the establishment’s lack of standards of hygiene is at fault here and that it was the dancer’s obligation to warn his client that she had an infectious disease. Mike Litte was also treated for symptoms of chlamydia and gonorrhea he also contracted that night. The owner of the strip club couldn’t be reached for comments but an employee reached by phone admitted that clients “licking the dance pole” was not a practice encouraged by the establishment. The lawsuit claims the Apollo strip club is liable for its employees and for maintaining minimal hygiene standards inside the establishment."
MAN CONTRACTS FLESH-EATING DISEASE AFTER EATING BOYFRIEND’S ANUS WHILE HE HAD DIARRHEA,951,"Adam Rader, 28, was transported to UCSF Medical Center after suffering from severe pain in his mouth and throat, as well as fever, and vomiting. Rader was rapidly diagnosed by the medical staff after his boyfriend told doctors his mouth had been in contact with diarrhea. Rader apparently did not heed his boyfriend’s warnings and attempted oral sex on his partner’s anal region, although he was apparently already suffering from the flu. Dr. Samantha Graham at San Francisco’s UCSF Medical Center warns that anal–oral contact and anal–oral sex with a partner showing symptoms of the flu can be very risky. Dr. Graham also warned about the dangers of ingesting one’s own fecal matter or that of a partner during sexual activities, which could lead to severe bacterial infection. In 2011, a student at the University of Georgia had also succumbed to flesh-eating disease several days after ingesting his own diarrhea as part of a fraternity initiation."
HAWAII: SCUBA DIVER HOSPITALIZED AFTER HIS PENIS GETS STUCK IN GIANT CLAM,1286,"Sean Madison, 22, was transported to Ka’u hospital after suffering from severe breathing complications, vomiting, extreme swelling and low blood pressure. Doctors believe physical contact with the giant mollusk may have triggered his allergy to seafood and exposed him to high levels of arsenic. Madison, 22, whose condition has stabilized, said he inserted his penis inside the clam as a prank to impress his friend, Thomas Meyer. The amateur diver also admitted he was still hung over from the night before and had consumed GHB and ecstasy, which impaired his judgment at the time. After eventually releasing himself from the clam, the young man later developed a severe allergic reaction and was rushed to Ka’u Hospital. Dr. Smith admits it is the first case of its kind he has seen in his 22 years of practice. A fatal incident occurred at the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu in 2014 when an aquarium employee put his head inside a giant clam and lost consciousness before he could be rescued, confirming the local reputation of the mollusk as a ‘killer clam’. In Hawaii folklore, the clam goddess Wawa U’ru was forcefully impregnated by A’ua A’uku, the shark god, but snapped the shark God’s genitals as revenge, leaving him emasculated and thus giving birth to the natives of Hawaii."
FLORIDA MAN FALLS VICTIM TO LEPROSY AFTER SEX WITH ARMADILLO,1861,"The young man that is being hospitalized at the Central Florida Regional Hospital is suffering from an advanced condition that doctors have determined to be Hansen’s disease, or leprosy, an affliction that has seen a dramatic revival in southern states where 9 cases have already been diagnosed in Florida alone since last October, according to the Department of Health. Doctors interrogated family members after the disease had proliferated to the young man’s pubic area, an uncommon area of the body for the affliction to spread. “At first glance, we tried to treat the affliction as an STD, but we soon realized our treatments were unsuccessful and the disease kept spreading more intensely until family members decided to tell us about the family animal” explains Dr. James H. Potter. “The family was afraid of legal consequences for the boy, but I’m glad they told us the entire story so that we can now treat him properly and prevent further spread of the disease” he added. The family members intervention might have saved the man’s life, believe experts. “Timothy always had a hard time interacting with others and making friends. He was always so keen about animals, so we decided to let him keep the animal after he had caught him last spring” admits Jane Whitestone, mother of the 22-year old man. “He was very fond of the little critter, he would spend all his time with him, even sleeping with him at night. We knew it was a bit awkward for a 22-year old to spend so much time with an armadillo, but he looked so happy, we never said a thing” she told local reporters. According to the Center for Disease Control, armadillos are the only animal to carry leprosy, a bacterial disease that affects the skin and nerves. The Health Resources and Services Administration has reported that there are currently about 6,500 cases of the disease in the U.S."
RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS DISCOVER CURE TO HOMOSEXUALITY,1501,"Russian scientists developed the so-called «antidote» based on a 1959 scientific research published under the title “Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig” by Charles H. Phoenix, an American researcher. The study concluded that “INAH [part of the hypothalamus] is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate”. «Xenoestrogen are a type of estrogen mimickers found in synthetic or natural chemical compounds. Synthetic xenoestrogens such as PCB’s, BPA and phthalates have been also been found to have estrogenic effects on living organisms and to disrupt the endocrine system» explains Dr. Yuri Krutchev, who took part in the experiment. «Injecting specific quantities of testosterone helps to «Injecting specific quantities of testosterone helps to upset this artificial biological unbalance which occurs mostly in part because of environmental pollution and an excess of estrogen mimickers in our modern environment» he adds. The new discovery has attracted much criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations around the Globe, yet a few country leaders have outspokenly shown support and interest for the research. Iran, China, and Saudi Arabia have been the first countries to show interest in the new discovery. American and European researchers have expressed much skepticism upon receiving the news."
ALASKA: CHEATING HUSBAND EMASCULATED AFTER WIFE HID BEAR TRAP INSIDE OF HER VAGINA,986,"Rosetta White, 36, was arrested this week after she admitted to hiding a 24 pound, 36” long bear trap with a jaw spread of 12 inches inside of her vagina to get back at her cheating husband. Medical staff at the Anchorage General Hospital also had to perform a surgical procedure to remove the 24-pound bear trap from the genitalia of Williams as well as retrieve her husband’s genitals. Although the man’s penis had been cut in half by the device and was later retrieved in the woman’s genitalia, medical staff are positive the surgical operation will allow the man to regain full use of his genitals in the upcoming months. “There was a loss of tissue, maybe two or three inches, but what is left of the genital organ should function when it has had time to heal,” added Dr. Alan Bergwin. A similar event occurred in San Francisco in 2019 when a cheating man was emasculated and contracted tetanus after his frustrated boyfriend inserted a dozen rusty nails inside of his anal cavity."
WOMAN FALLS PREGNANT AFTER SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH USED MALE SEX DOLL SHE ORDERED ON EBAY,949,"Anita White, 38, had recently ordered a male sex doll through eBay when she noticed she stopped having her period. White, who is single, could not explain the surprise pregnancy until her doctor asked her if she had had any recent sexual encounters. White also explained that she had come out publicly about the incident with the hope of preventing such a situation from repeating itself. “I would strongly advise to thoroughly wash any used sex doll purchased from the internet and to refrain from lending it to friends or family members,” she warned reporters. Anita White has yet to perform a DNA test to know if the baby originated from the semen of the previous owner or if one of her homosexual friends could be the father but has decided to keep the child which she believes is “Godsent.” In 2019, a similar case occurred after a woman sued Walmart for child support after being impregnated by a dildo she had purchased from the retail store."
WOMAN SUES DOCTOR FOR $2M AFTER HE ACCIDENTALLY PERFORMED CIRCUMCISION ON HER LARGE CLITORIS,951,"Suzan Young, 37, was hospitalized last week at the Saint Benedict Baptist Hospital after suffering from symptoms of vulvitis, an inflammation of the genitals. Young’s clitoris had dangerously swollen after her husband had applied peanut butter on the area, a substance to which she is allergic. The medical worker union representing Dr. Abdul Jabbar claims the doctor made an “honest mistake” alleging that the unusually large size of the clitoris led the doctor to believe he was performing an operation on a “more than average size penis.” “There was no reason to believe at the time that he was performing a medical procedure onto a woman,” a spokesman of the Detroit Baptist Hospital told reporters. The operation was allegedly performed to help calm the inflammation and the circumcision of the clitoris, although unheard of as a medical procedure, had not permanently damaged the genitals has said the union spokesperson in the doctor’s defense."
11-YEAR-OLD GIRL HOSPITALIZED AFTER KISSING HUNDREDS OF FROGS IN SEARCH OF PRINCE CHARMING,961,"Apparently, the young girl took the story of the frog prince too literally, believing she would eventually find her prince charming by kissing hundreds of frogs. In doing so, medical staff at Baptist Medical Center South explained that the young girl exposed herself to chemicals that reside in frogs and toads skins’, called bufotoxins, which led her to develop an extreme skin rash over several months. The girl’s symptoms have not only spread to her face but also to her tongue, throat, and trachea, heavily impacting breathing conditions according to medical staff. “The young woman described how she would ‘french kiss’ the animals by inserting her tongue fully inside the frog’s mouth, which could explain the inflammation in the trachea area,” Dr. Patterson added. In 2018, the Mexican government banned the traditional Aztec practice of licking frogs as a libido enhancer after a nationwide poll revealed that one in two Mexicans practiced frog-licking."
MIAMI WOMAN MUGS CONVENIENCE STORE WITH BLOODY TAMPON INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS,1036,"According to eyewitness testimonies, Ophelia Jackson, 34, threatened the convenience store clerk with a “bloody tampon” which had allegedly been exposed to the coronavirus. Jackson kept coughing and sneezing during the holdup while holding the bloody tampon to the face of the employee, threatening him multiple times that she would “shove it down his throat” if he didn’t comply. Ophelia Jackson left with $34 from the cash register, 2 packs of cigarettes and a bag of Cheetos before she was apprehended by Miami police. “The suspect threw the potentially lethal object at an officer before she was neutralized with the use of a taser gun. I am happy to say that the officer in question has proven not to be infected with COVID-19 and should recover swiftly,” reassured Deputy Sheriff Alan Johnson of the Miami Police Department. Last week, a similar event occurred in the downtown Miami area when a man attempted to rob a grocery store while threatening store employees with his erect penis while masturbating and claiming he had HIV."
TEEN SUFFERS BROKEN NECK AFTER GIVING BLOW JOBS TO SEVENTEEN MEN TO CELEBRATE 17TH BIRTHDAY,1086,"Jennifer Swann was celebrating her seventeenth birthday with friends and family when she was told by her brother that the age of consent for sexual activity was 17 in Colorado. Under the influence of alcohol and in a giddy mood, Swann was later convinced by friends to perform oral sex on seventeen men, ranging from 16 to 45 years of age, to commemorate her 17th birthday. Swann also admits she has developed swallowing difficulties, bite and jaw deformities, as well as chewing difficulties since the incident. “I keep drooling and have difficulty closing my mouth. When I eat I can’t hold the food inside my mouth, I have to store in the cheeks instead,” she added. Swann plans to become a public speaker in the near future and wishes to reach out to preschools and high schools all over the country to warn children and teenagers of the harmful effects of practicing extreme oral sex. By telling her story, Swann hopes to turn this tragic event into something positive and to help and inspire other youths around the country and the world to perform oral sex in a healthier fashion."
MIAMI STRIPPER ARRESTED FOR SQUIRTING VAGINAL FLUIDS AT POLICE OFFICERS IN SELF-DEFENSE,1108,"Britney Simmons, 24, was performing at the Camel Toe strip club when an altercation began between Simmons and several clients at the club. Miami police were called to intervene and attempted to apprehend Simmons who was highly intoxicated and acting erratically according to the official police report. Five Miami Police Department officers attempted to place Simmons under arrest but were momentarily indisposed when the lap dancer ejected vaginal fluids towards the officers, temporarily blinding three and injuring two. Simmons’s attorney, Alan Smith, argued that his client acted in self-defense and used her vagina, not as a deadly weapon, but in the “appropriate boundaries of her working skills and abilities.” According to current Florida laws and if convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against five police officers, Simmons could face up to 1,036 years in jail believe legal experts. In a 2013 court case, another Miami citizen was convicted of armed robbery after threatening a convenient store clerk with his erect and “AIDS-infected penis” and was sentenced to 237 years in jail."
CALIFORNIA: PRO-CHOICE ACTIVIST PROUDLY BREAKS WORLD RECORD BY GETTING HER 27TH ABORTION,1084,"The historic operation was performed at the Sacramento Street Health Center and required Elena Travis, 34, to visit the abortion clinic three consecutive times because she was 24 weeks pregnant. Elena Travis, 34, a medical school student who hopes to one day perform abortions herself, believes abortion is a right and hopes to inspire other women to have it practiced on them by showing others that it is a safe and healthy procedure. Elena Travis had her first abortion at the age of 9 and says abortions have since been the ideal solution for her since she reacts negatively to birth control and emergency contraceptive pills. Although Travis says she loves the feeling of being pregnant and bearing life within her womb, she says she realizes that giving birth would only doom her child to “a life of misery and suffering” and be “an extra burden for the planet.” Other Pro-Choice activists on social media have even compared her to legendary feminists such as Margaret Sanger and Margaret Thatcher, although she claims she is just doing her part to make the world a better place."
WOMAN FOUND NOT CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 19 MURDERS DUE TO EXTREME PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME,1498,"49-year old Jennifer Walters was accused of 19 homicides and 14 assaults committed between 2009 and 2019 in four various counties across Missouri. She pleaded that she suffered from Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), an extreme version of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) approximately 500 times more intense, claiming her condition made her “completely lose control” in the week or two before her monthly period starts. The jury’s verdict came this morning after an 8-month long trial that she is “not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder” (NCRMD) on all 33 charges. Her lawyer, Mr. Michael Heinz, described the judgment as an important jurisprudence for the recognition of premenstrual disorder as a mental illness. Mr. Heinz says jokingly that he had to avoid meeting his client in the weeks before her period during the eight months the trial lasted. Three experts presented different psychiatric evaluations of the accused during the trial with several differences in their conclusions. Two of the experts judged she did “lose her capacity to distinguish right from wrong” one or two weeks per month while the third disagreed. All three recognized it was impossible to determine if she was suffering from PMDD at the time when the various crimes were committed, but described her as “highly unstable and potentially violent”. The judgment as caused a lot of reactions, and the state attorney in this case, Ms. Laura Myers, says she’s already considering appealing the decision."
MAN FORCED TO PAY $1.2M IN ALIMONY AFTER CHEATING ON WIFE WITH GHOST OF MARILYN MONROE USING A OUIJA BOARD,1167,"Norman O’Reilly, 67, was charged with a felony for committing adultery, engaging in extramarital sexual activities, and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars during his affair with the “ghost spirit” of Marilyn Monroe. The plaintiff’s attorney claimed that his client’s husband spent lavishly on wardrobes and trips to Las Vegas and had sex on numerous occasions with the Ouija board he used to contact the deceased actress during their 27-year-long marriage. The plaintiff also said that her husband had spent all of their retirement funds to buy lavish wardrobes, expensive jewelry and paid for luxury hotel suites in Las Vegas for his mistress. “He has a collection of 400 shoes I can’t even wear because they are to the measurements of Marilyn Monroe’s feet,” she admitted in court. Norman O’Reilly admitted to the affair in court explaining that the affair had cost him a fortune because of Marilyn’s “taste for luxury,” “expensive lifestyle” and craving for “champagne and caviar.” In a similar case in 2011, a husband was ordered to pay $30 million to his ex-wife after he admitted to having a three-year-long homosexual affair with a poster of Boy George."
UTAH FAMILY CLAIMS 15-YEAR-OLD SON TURNED GAY AFTER 5G CELL PHONE TOWER WAS INSTALLED NEAR HOME,1064,"Thomas McGuire, 45, and his wife Caroll McGuire, 41, noticed that their son was “behaving abnormally” only weeks after a 5G cell tower was installed next to their home. The McGuire family say their son started listening to “queer music” such as David Bowie, Prince, and the Back Street Boys in the weeks following the apparition of the 5G tower as well as using make-up and dressing in an “effeminate way.” Conspiracy theorists believe 5G towers can have disruptive effects on human health but could also be used by companies and governments for mind control and mind reading. “I have never been a conspiracy nut, except maybe for that fake moon landing hoax and, of course, 911 being an inside job, but my son’s homosexual symptoms have been well documented by 5G experts all over the world,” the teenager’s father added. Although experts believe that the fears around 5G causing homosexual tendencies are grossly overblown, one 2019 French study did show that 5G radio frequencies did increase the online consumption of male pornography in several test subjects."
WOMAN RUNS OVER HUSBAND 17 TIMES WITH PICKUP TRUCK AFTER RECEIVING STRAP-ON DILDO FOR CHRISTMAS,848,"Annabelle Stockton, 47, rammed her husband, Gerald Heinz, 53, into the garage door with their 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 after she was apparently displeased with the present she received on Christmas Day. Stockton then allegedly ran over her husband several times in front of family members and neighbors before fleeing the scene. Eyewitnesses also claim the victim was threatened by Stockton with a chainsaw as well as a blow torch before she decided to enter the vehicle and use it as a weapon. “It’s a good thing that women are terrible drivers or I would probably not be alive as we speak,” husband Gerald Heinz added jokingly. Although the husband admits the couple of twenty years has had its share of disagreements in the past, he has decided not to press charges for domestic assault and insists he should have bought a new vacuum cleaner instead."
TRANS SPECIES MAN WHO SELF-IDENTIFIES AS A DEER ACCIDENTALLY SHOT BY HUNTERS,1145,"William Tenenbaum, 31, is lying in critical condition according to medical staff at Allendale County Hospital after being mistaken for a deer by two local hunters. According to the two hunters, Tenenbaum was dressed and painted in the colors of a deer and was wearing antlers which made him unrecognizable to the two men. William Tenenbaum’s mother, Michelle, said that her son has always been socially awkward and struggled with making friends but has a great passion for nature and the outdoors. “When he was eight he believed he was a porcupine, then at 12 a squirrel, now he’s a deer. It could be worse, he could be a homosexual,” his mother argued when reached by phone. Tenenbaum’s mother admitted that her son’s life choices are eccentric and have necessitated some adaptation by the family. “On Thanksgiving Day, since deer don’t eat meat, we made him a salad of pine needles and pine cones which he seemed to enjoy,” she added. In 2016, William Tenenbaum made local headlines for breaking and entering into a deer farm and allegedly sexually assaulting several animals but was later released after the owner decided to drop the charges."
18-YEAR-OLD ARRESTED FOR BREAKING INTO HAIR SALON AND GIVING HIMSELF A HAIRCUT,827,"Timothy Heinz, 18, was highly intoxicated on crystal meth when he broke into the local business. Heinz told officers that he did not intend to burglarize the place but only to “give himself a haircut” according to the official police report. It is not currently known if Heinz suffers from mental health problems or if his behavior is solely due to his state of intoxication at the time. “I wish he had asked us for a free haircut, it would’ve saved me a hell lot of trouble and hundreds of thousands in damage claims,” owner Patrice O’Neal told reporters. The young man also shaved his chest, arms, legs, and pubic hair before Denver police arrested him according to released surveillance footage. Last week, a similar event occurred when a man broke into a Denver grocery store because he badly needed a roll of toilet paper."
"PAKISTANI MAN SENTENCED TO 1,000 LASHES FOR MASTURBATING TO DRAWING OF PROPHET MUHAMMAD",810,"The former student in graphic design at Lahore University apparently indulged in drawing erotic pictures of the prophet Muhammad in various sexual positions. The young man sometimes even drew the prophet in sexual acts with people, animals, and even home appliances such as a toaster and a vacuum cleaner. Abdullah Al Samir initially entered an insanity plea, claiming he has a mental disorder and was drunk and high when he made the illustrations to no avail. Although idolatry is prohibited by Sharia law and punishable by death, Judge El Hazim was lenient and only sentenced the young man to 1,000 lashes and chemical castration to “subdue his deviant sexual urges”. The last similar condemnation occurred in 1983 after a man was beheaded for tattooing a portrait of the prophet Muhammad onto his own penis."
ARIZONA TAXIDERMIST ARRESTED FOR STUFFING HIS DEAD WIFE AND KEEPING HER ON A COUCH IN HIS LIVING ROOM,991,"51-year old Maurice Paterson is a renowned taxidermist who earns a living by stuffing animals destined to be kept as hunting trophies or pet memorials. According to the police report, when his wife Mary died of breast cancer two years ago, he decided to memorialize her in his own unique way. Mr. Paterson stuffed his wife with incredible care before dressing her up and placing her in a sitting position on her usual couch. Frank Robbins, a friend of the accused, says the illusion was so perfect that he didn’t even know that Mary was dead. Coconino County Sheriff’s Office spokesman, Captain Dale McPhee, says they were tipped off after an accident finally revealed the woman’s condition. Mr. Paterson faces extremely serious criminal charges of desecration of a human corpse and abuse of a dead body. If found guilty on all charges, he faces a total of 20 years in prison and a fine of $150,000. His trial is set to begin in January at the Coconino County Superior Court, in Flagstaff.  "
OHIO WOMAN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO STEAL A CHRISTMAS TREE BY HIDING IT IN HER VAGINA,1896,"According to the police report, 43-year old Wanda Brown took a 7.5-Ft Slim Yuletide Pine Christmas Tree with her inside the store’s restrooms with the intent of inserting it entirely in her body cavities and steal it. Unfortunately for her, the pain caused by the insertion was too great and she lost consciousness before the end of the process. She was found lying bloodied and senseless on the floor in the middle of the restroom by other customers who immediately decided to call 911. Lucy Myers, one of the women who found Ms. Brown and called the paramedics, says she thought the woman had been the victim of an extremely savage aggression. Officers of the Cincinnati Police Department (CPD) were rapidly dispatched on the site expecting a manhunt for a sexual offender. According to CPD spokesman, Captain Terrell Harris, the officers were in disbelief when they saw the footage of the security cameras and understood that the woman’s wounds were self-inflicted during an ill-conceived criminal plan. Wanda Brown was transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center where doctors still consider her condition “critical but stable” and no longer fear for her life. She suffered from severe lacerations necessitating over 375 stitches and lost more than 2 liters of blood. She hasn’t regained consciousness yet, but doctors expect her to do so within a few days. Ms. Brown has a long criminal record including several larceny charges, as well as other crimes like possession of counterfeit documents and even impersonating a police officer. She will face two new charges of larceny and indecent exposure, but her lawyer has demanded a pŝychiatric evaluation to determine if she is fit to stand trial. The evaluation is set to take place after she regains consciousness and recovers from her injuries, which means her trial shouldn’t take place before February or March of next year."
FLORIDA FISHERMAN LOST AT SEA FOR 14 DAYS CLAIMS HE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY MERMAIDS,1088,"Alvin McCallister, 72, was found on a small rocky islet 200 miles off the nearest coastline where he shipwrecked two weeks ago and managed to survive off of several seagulls, mussels, and urchins. McCallister, for whom doctors do not fear for his life, was found suffering from intense hallucinations possibly caused by dehydration and the toxins of unidentified mussels he consumed on the small islet. McCallister, who is believed to have ingurgitated some form of toxin such as lead or mercury found in dangerous quantities in certain varieties of mussels he possibly consumed, is still under psychiatric evaluation. “Although Mr. McCallister does present abnormal injuries and inflammation to the genital and anal area, it is highly unlikely that he was sexually exploited or sodomized by living sea creatures and these are possibly self-inflicted” explained one medical expert. Although McCallister’s mental state is presently unstable, doctors believe he should heal completely in the weeks to come after his body has expurgated the dangerous levels of toxins he has been exposed to."
NURSING HOME EMPLOYEE ADDICTED TO SEX FORCE-FED ELDERLY WITH VIAGRA,1173,"Giselle Hornby, 49, a nursing home aid at Parkview Nursing Center, has been arrested this week after multiple allegations of sexual assault and abuse. The abuses occurred during a three-year time period on the behalf of over 78 residents, male and female, aged from 72 to 103 years of age. Hornby is also accused of having given Viagra on a daily basis to a number of residents before forcing them into sexual intercourse without their consent. Although some residents openly enjoyed the abuse of the former nursing home aid and claim it was all done consensually, one resident admitted to reporters that he sincerely disliked the “weird sex toys” and the “anal stuff.” “She is the best thing that has happened to me since my wife passed away 35 years ago, but I admit having an erection 16 hours a day was a bit annoying,” one resident told local reporters. Investigators admit that even though no resident has officially filed a complaint against the former nursing aide she is still liable to criminal charges.

Irwin says the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the Apollo 11 landing and the MeToo movement has prompted her to come out and share the story of her husband. Irwin says her husband often complained about how his NASA partner would address sexual subjects and touch him in an inappropriate fashion during the 11-day-long trip. “Once Irwin told me how David kept masturbating and droplets of semen floated all across the shuttle,” she recounted, visibly disgusted. Their daughter, Eileen Irwin, who was also interviewed by the Houston Gazette warned reporters that her mother is currently “mentally unstable” and under “heavy medication.” No NASA spokesman was available for comments at the time of publication."
NEW ZEALAND: SERIAL SHEEP RAPIST SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON,1107,"William Furphy, 63, a retired New Zealand farm worker has been arrested over 117 times for having sex in public with farm animals since 1993 but only convicted 37 times with no jail time. Judge Jane Seymour described Furphy as a repeat sexual offender who had no compassion for the harm he had inflicted upon his victims as well as no respect for New Zealand laws that sanction bestiality. William Furphy admitted himself in court that he never intended to stop and that all his sexual relations with the animals were consensual. Furphy also pleaded that the animals enjoyed it and that he had sexual relationships with them because the animals “practically begged for it.” “My family has been herding sheep for generations. I understand their needs and so I give them what they want” he added, to a visibly annoyed judge. Judge Jane Seymour sentenced William Furphy to life with no parole and a minimum one-year sentence for every conviction he had been prosecuted for since 1993 for a grand total of 37 years, the most severe criminal sentence in New Zealand since the death penalty was abolished in 1989."
TEXAS: 14-YEAR-OLD BOY MIRACULOUSLY CURED OF HOMOSEXUALITY AFTER ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY,1204,"The new experimental electroshock therapy, which originates from China where the treatment takes place in public, government-run hospitals and in private clinics, is the first of its kind to be performed on the American soil. Doctors at the Dallas Baptist Hospital have allegedly seen major progress in the young man’s behavior, claiming that his “homosexual urges” have also undergone a dramatic drop. Dr. Erich von Eisenstein explained that the therapy can sometimes cause “important neurological disorders” but that these are “temporary” and can be explained by the high-frequency voltage applied to the brain tissue through the scalp of the patient. “Through induction, this new technology can transmit high-frequency voltage of up to 35 000 volts at a time during an extremely short period calculated in milliseconds, and which, if prolonged, would cause permanent brain damage or even death,” warned Dr. Eiseintein. The former leader of the People’s Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, was a fierce proponent of electroshock therapy treatment which he encouraged during China’s cultural revolution, a period during which homosexuality was declared a “mental illness” and a “capitalist disease.”"
BINGE EATER HOSPITALIZED AFTER GOBBLING UP MORE THAN 30 LBS OF URINAL DEODORIZERS,1511,"64-year old Marius Hanson, from Freeport in Illinois, works as a janitor in a retirement home and he was found unconscious around 11 PM last night by one of his coworkers. He’s known for suffering from binge eating disorder (BED), which has led him to eat compulsively several things on his worksite in the past, including toilet paper, plastic syringes, disposable diapers, and even a couple of mops heads. Eric Fraser, the colleague who found him inert next to an empty box of chemical deodorizers says he immediately realized what had happened. Mr. Fraser rapidly called 911 before performing a heart massage on his colleague until the paramedics arrived a few minutes later. Luckily, Mr. Hansen was transported to the hospital, where doctors were rapidly able to stabilize him and treat his poisoning. He had even regained consciousness this morning and suffered from no apparent consequences from his ordeal. Every year, thousands of Americans are hospitalized due to the consequences of binge eating disorder, a problem estimated to affect around 90,000 across the U.S. While most of these cases involve actual food or at least edible items, several dozen cases every year involve non-edible or even poisonous products. Over the last few years, some cases have involved things as various as foam padding, cd’s, cigarette butts, nail varnish, and even lightbulbs. Even if most victims are able to survive and even cure of BED, more the 300 Americans die every year from eating dangerous or poisonous items."
SAUDI ARABIA: MAN’S HAND CUT OFF FOR MASTURBATING DURING RAMADAN,1175,"The man caused a commotion last week as he exhibited his genitals while masturbating during prayer time in a large mosque of the Al Bahah area, creating a wave of panic amongst fellow worshippers who exited the mosque in great numbers reports the Riyad Herald. The man’s family that claims that he is sick and possessed by an evil jinn (spirit) also said he had no control over his left hand and masturbated often, even while reading the Quran, during prayer time and at the mosque. “We were also ordered to kill most of our goats because he had haraam (improper) relations with them. My son’s disease has brought shame and poverty to our family,” she added in tears. Judge Muhammad Al-Wahari’s decision to amputate was received as a merciful one for the severity of the crime. “Although the disruptive nature and the obscenity of the crime should be harshly punished, I will be tolerant in my judgment and only condemn the accused to be amputated of his left hand,” judge Al-Wahari said in court. The judge also advised 600 lashes for incommoding the members of the mosque and highly suggested consulting an exorcist to treat the young man’s “indecent and obscene behavior”."
"FBI SEIZES OVER 3,000 PENISES DURING RAID AT MORGUE EMPLOYEE’S HOME",1171,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected 54-year old Dave Murray, an employee of the Harris County Morgue, of being implicated in an organ trafficking network. Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts, dozens of agents raided his residence this morning, hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes. What they found on the site was a lot more disturbing than what they expected, as the FBI spokesman Andy Ramirez described the scene in an interview with WNTV-4. According to Agent Ramirez, the accused rapidly confessed everything as soon as he was arrested. It took the FBI more than seven hours to gather all the organs and other pieces of evidence that were found on the site. A total of 53 criminal charges have already been filed against Mr. Murray and hundreds more could be filed over the next few days. An anonymous FBI source told WNTV-4 that the number of charges could reach over 3,000. Dave Murray will remain in custody for the moment as a psychiatric evaluation has been ordered to determine if he’s fit to stand trial. If he is considered fit, he should appear in court in October for the beginning of the procedures."
BABYSITTER TRANSPORTED TO HOSPITAL AFTER INSERTING A BABY IN HER VAGINA,1380,"Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital, where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation. The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip, but doctors don’t think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident. The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity. She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth. Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges, including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm, and could spend up to 65 years in prison. Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation, claiming that she isn’t fit to stand trial. Depending on the results of the evaluation, her trial could begin in June."
DEATH ROW INMATE EATS AN ENTIRE BIBLE AS HIS LAST MEAL,1186,"The prison guards of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible. Against all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it. It took hours of chewing and swallowing small pieces of paper, but Mr. Morris ate the totality of the 1200-page book, including the cover. Walter Henri, the prison guard who handed him the old and worn out Bible, says the inmate seemed to “savor every bite”. Holman Prison director, Frank Davis, says the staff decided to let the prisoner eat the Bible because it didn’t violate the establishment’s “last meal policy”. In most states and various countries where the death penalty is legal, it’s customary to give sentenced prisoners a special last meal at their request. Restrictions do apply, concerning mostly the legality, the accessibility and value of the meal. Despite its unusual nature, Mr. Morris’ choice of meal was “locally accessible and worth less than 40$”, making it conform to the rules of Alabama correctional facilities. Jeremy Morris is expected to be executed tomorrow for the killing of two Catholic nuns in 2007."
WOMAN ARRESTED FOR TRAINING SQUIRRELS TO ATTACK HER EX-BOYFRIEND,1352,"The victim, 51-year-old James Robinson, was presumably attacked by the rodents on more than a dozen occasions over the last month. These attacks caused him many serious injuries, including the loss of two fingers and one testicle, bitten off by his attackers. The poor man had no idea why squirrels kept attacking him until he saw his ex-girlfriend, a former circus animal trainer, cheering the animals during one of the attacks. Realizing that his life could be in danger, Mr. Robinson filed a complaint with the police who later paid a visit to Ms. Smith. In her residence, they found a dozen cages, holding a total of 27 squirrels. They also found two training dummies with pictures of Mr. Robinson taped over their faces. Detroit Police Chief James Craig confirmed that Janice Smith had admitted that she was responsible for the attacks and confessed her strange plot. The 45-year old woman is now facing a variety of criminal charges linked to criminal harassment and using animals as weapons. Janice Smith’s lawyers have demanded for her to undergo a psychological evaluation, claiming that she was unfit to stand trial. They say that her choice of training squirrels instead of dogs or bears suggests that she might be suffering from mental problems. If she is judged fit to stand trial, Ms. Smith will be facing a maximum of 65 years in prison."
