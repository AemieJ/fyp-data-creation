5 Tips to Help With Drug Addiction Recovery,3898,"The process of drug addiction recovery involves a lot of work. As much as you receive medical care and treatment from the rehab facility, there are also roles that you must play for the process to pay off in the end. The last thing that a patient, their family, and community want is the case of relapse. For this reason, finding ways to stay sober and concentrate on the recovery process has become important. Here are the tips to help with drug addiction recovery. To concentrate on the recovery process and avoid relapse, you must understand your external triggers and work on them as the patient. These can be things, people, places, and situations that bring out thoughts, cravings, emotions, or feelings associated with substance use. The internal and external triggers play a big part in making the recovery process overwhelming. When you identify these risks, developing a plan to help you avoid them or seek help becomes possible. During the recovery process, stress, financial difficulties, environmental cues, and relationship problems are the common triggers that you should be aware of. Until you experience withdrawal syndrome, they will just be words to you as a patient. The post-withdrawal symptoms can last for months, making it hard to handle the recovery process. These symptoms, in most cases, can be overwhelming, especially in an uncontrolled environment. Seeking knowledge and preparing for the withdrawal syndrome is one way of handling the drug addiction recovery process well. You need your body and mind ready for what will come next as soon as you start the detox and treatment process. Let medical specialists guide you on what to expect and how best to prepare. After the addiction treatment center or rehab facility, getting back home to a familiar environment can have varying impacts on the recovery process. You must remain resolute and dedicated to the treatment and recovery process. For this reason, you must avoid old routines and habits. While at first it can prove hectic, understand that old routines and habits can come between you and the recovery efforts. Talk to counselors and therapists and get guidance on making positive changes in your routine and habits. Have a change of routine and habits both at home and in the workplace. Your time in an addiction treatment center or rehab facility should help you understand how unhealthy relationships contribute to your addiction. The relationship you had with drug dealers or friends at the bars was the reason for your current situation. You must part ways with your previous relationships and focus on building new healthy ones to achieve your recovery objectives. When you build healthy relationships, you also find effective ways to handle external triggers, lowering relapse chances. With the right friends and company, remaining sober and productive in the community becomes a reality. The treatments you received in the rehab facility might have caused plenty of changes in your body. Physically, you will look tired, malnourished, and lack energy. While the target is full recovery, you must practice healthy living for better results. You also want to remain mentally sharp and able. Practicing healthy living is a conduit to self-care. Start by regular physical activity. Keep your body engaged and active. You should also eat well-balanced meals regularly, get enough quality sleep, engage in recreational activities and hobbies, and often seek medical checkups and treatments. You will handle the drug addiction recovery process well with https://www.theprocessrecoverycenter.com/. Going through the drug addiction recovery process should be a win for everyone in the community. As a patient, you must understand what it means to the people around you to see you sober, healthy, and productive. Keeping the above tips and many others in mind and practicing them, therefore, becomes paramount."
What Does Tadalafil Do for a Woman?,2678,"The tadanafil powder produces tadalafil medicine. Tadalafil is a medication that is used to treat erection issues (erectile dysfunction) as well as symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostate enlargement). It is also used to treat pulmonary hypertension on occasion (high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs). Tadalafil is only available with a prescription. It comes in the form of tablets that you take with water. It is safe to take with or without food. Specific drugs should not be taken at or near the time of eating food, or when consuming certain types of food, because interactions may occur. Using alcohol or smoke in conjunction with some medications may also result in interactions. Keep the medication in a tightly sealed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Prevent the freezer from freezing. Keep out of children’s reach. Do not keep out-of-date or no-longer-needed medications. Tadalafil is also used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension in both men and women in order to increase your capacity to exercise. This is excessive blood pressure that occurs in the major artery that transports blood from the ventricle on the right side of the heart to the lungs. When the smaller blood capillaries in the lungs become less permeable to blood flow, the right ventricle has to work harder to push enough blood through the lungs. Tadalafil relaxes blood arteries by acting on the PDE5 enzyme in the lungs. This increases the supply of blood to the lungs while decreasing the workload on the heart. Tadalafil is not suggested during pregnancy or breastfeeding if you have pulmonary hypertension. There is no convincing evidence that tadalafil helps women with sexual issues. Tadalafil is only available to people above the age of 18. Some people should not take tadalafil. You should not use tadalafil if you are: Tadalafil, like all medications, might cause negative effects in some people. Many people experience no or moderate negative effects. More than one out of every hundred persons will experience a common adverse effect. As the dose is increased, the side effects may become more severe. If you experience adverse effects such as headaches, nausea, red or flushed skin, indigestion, stuffy nose, or muscle aches, continue taking the medication, but notify your doctor or pharmacist if they disturb you or do not go away. Some major side effects include a sudden difficulty with your eyesight or hearing, a serious skin response – symptoms may include red raised patches on your skin or red spots (hives), a swollen face and swelling around the eyes, or convulsions or fits."
Innovative Technologies that Changed the Healthcare Industry,5366,"Developments in technology transformed the healthcare industry at a time that it needed the most. The pandemic compelled healthcare professionals and their patients to make adjustments to avoid getting infected. One of these adjustments was telemedicine that allowed patients to consult their doctors even without visiting the clinic or medical facility. Aside from telemedicine, the healthcare industry also adopted other innovative technologies that enhanced its operations. From patient management to augmented reality in medical procedures, these technologies allowed the industry to develop by leaps and bounds. Here are some innovative technologies that changed the healthcare industry. Nanomedicine Nanomedicine is the use of nanotechnology in the healthcare industry. It aims to prevent and treat diseases using the tools and knowledge of nanotechnology. It involves using materials at the nanometric scale in different fields of medicine. The technology has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It also aims to deliver drugs using precise delivery systems, leading to personalized and targeted delivery of medicines without affecting the other parts of the body. For instance, it can deliver chemotherapy straight to the tumor without impacting the rest of the body. Nanomedicine has several products going through clinical trials for many major diseases, including inflammatory, musculoskeletal, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular. This branch of medicine already has products in the market for diagnostics and medical imaging. Surgical Management System A surgical management system allows hospitals to enhance the efficiency of their operations and automate patient communication. It also provides consistent perioperative care or the care a patient receives at the time of the surgery. This type of care typically starts when the patient first enters the hospital for the procedure until the patient goes home. The system also incorporates anesthesiology practice management software to help anesthesiologists take better care of patients. It removes the administrative tasks from the doctors so that they can focus on taking care of the patient. The software works on providing all the necessary information about the patient to ensure the medical professionals have an idea about the patient’s status. Patient Management Through IoT The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare ensures the patients are well-taken care of while under the supervision of a healthcare professional. It facilitates real-time monitoring of patients and provides healthcare professionals access to health data whenever necessary. Patient interaction with the doctor is no longer limited to physical visits or even telemedicine services. The use of wearable sensors allows doctors to have continuous access to the health status of the patient. Whether they are at home or in the hospital, the doctors can check the data collected by these sensors to identify the patient’s best treatment. Hospitals can also use IoT to monitor the location of medical equipment within their premises. Administrators can also analyze the proper deployment of staff in the hospital at any given time using the technology. Additionally, they can manage assets properly and in real-time, such as the temperature and humidity of the refrigerator where they store the medicine. This is useful at this time since some vaccines require a certain temperature to retain their efficacy. Precision Medicine The lifestyle, genetic makeup, and environment of an individual can affect the diagnosis and treatment of his condition. Precision medicine is an approach that focuses on these variables in the treatment and preventive care of an individual. Using this approach allows medical professionals to use accurate prevention and treatment strategies in certain groups of people. It does not subscribe to the one-size-fits-all approach in medicine. The approach takes into account the differences between two different patients. With this, it can change the measures used to treat illnesses. It can also reduce treatment time for each patient. Even though precision medicine is a new term, its concept has been used in the healthcare industry for a long time. One good example is blood transfusion. Healthcare professionals do not give blood to a person that comes from a random donor. Instead, they match the blood type of the donor with the blood type of the patient. Researchers are now aiming to expand its use to other areas of the healthcare industry. Augmented Reality in Surgery Augmented reality in surgery uses special software and hardware that provides surgeons with computer-generated data in real-time. The system combines computer-generated images with real-life objects. The use of the technology in surgical practice gained a lot of interest since it may be useful, as shown in pre-clinical research. It can also lead to better accuracy in positioning while reducing radiation in different orthopedic procedures. Despite these positive notes, concerns emerged about the accuracy of the images shown on the screen. While it can be a useful tool for training, more research is required before being fully used on actual surgeries. The healthcare industry will continue to improve as more innovations in technology will emerge in the next few years."
How Aesthetic Lasers are Used,3315,"Laser treatment has experienced tremendous changes in recent years. Its evolvement helps people live more comfortably and less conscious about their looks. Lasers are widely used to treat various conditions, ranging from acne, scars, warts, wrinkles, and more. They are common in different medicine sectors, like dentistry, surgery, dermatology, and cosmetic procedures. The lasers used in cosmetic procedures are referred to as aesthetic lasers. Aesthetic lasers-How do they work? Aesthetic lasers are potent tools in cosmetic procedures. They are used in hair removal, skin resurfacing, tattoo removal, and many more. Aesthetic lasers generate an intense beam of light over a short distance during skin treatment. They destruct skin lesions without interfering with the skin tissue in surrounding areas. What’s more? Lasers stimulate the growth of fibroblasts which encourage new collagen growth. This results in firmer and younger-looking skin. For excellent results, it’s advisable to go for licensed cosmetic lasers, and this is why most practitioners choose Sentient Lasers. They also come in different models and sizes to match your cosmetic needs. How are aesthetic lasers used? Laser hair removal is surgery for alleviating unwanted body hairs from the skin. Laser beams focus on individual strands to remove hair painlessly and permanently. The procedure damages the hair follicles and the shaft, making the hair fall out by itself and not grow back. Once the follicles are damaged, the hair is unable to grow back. Some modern hair removal procedures use the picosecond aesthetic laser. The device is ultrafast and is quicker than the standard laser. In some cases, lasers are used to boost hair growth. They stimulate healing to damaged hair follicles and promote new growth. Breast augmentation is a procedure that uses low laser energy and is non-invasive. In the process, the laser moves across the chest to tighten the breast tissue and boost cell growth. Laser breast augmentation is effective in enhancing the look and contour of your breasts. Also, lasers are widely used in other conventional breast surgeries to alleviate pain and inflammation after operation. Laser liposuction is safer compared to the traditional liposuction method. The procedure alters fat cells below the skin’s surface, leading to emulsification. That’s not all, though! The liquefied fat is then reabsorbed and eliminated by the body through normal processes or detox programs. Unlike the traditional liposuction methods, lasers tighten the skin with minimal trauma inflicted on the body. And this means speedy recovery since there are no stitches involved. Lasers are popularly used in tattoo removal and offer better results. Laser tattoo removal is less painful with minimal chances of scarring. These machines break up the ink particles in the tattoo without damaging the surrounding areas. However, the ink color and the tattoo size determine the number of laser treatments required. The bottom line Aesthetic lasers are useful in cosmetic procedures like tattoo removal, breast augmentation, hair removal, and more. These machines are faster and promise better results, meaning you don’t have to stay in bed for weeks after the surgery. However, practitioners should acquire such lasers from reputed manufacturers."
Why Professional Teeth Whitening Is More Effective Than DIY Kits,5140,"Our smiles are one of the first things people notice about us and the key to making a great first impression. People are willing to invest in their dental procedures to get the best dental treatment from dependable dentists. Among these dental services, teeth whitening is an increasingly popular treatment among people who want a whiter and brighter smile. In recent years, DIY teeth whitening products have been hitting grocery shelves and late-night infomercials. Images of young people flaunting their pearly white smiles are filling our social media feed while holding teeth whitening kits, pens, strips, and LED trays. All these have spurred people’s obsession to achieve an attractive smile. Although over-the-counter whitening kits are affordable and convenient to use, these products don’t offer the benefits offered by professional teeth whitening. While most people are expecting decent and quick outcomes from at-home products, they don’t compare to the many benefits professional teeth whitening offers. If you’re deciding whether to buy a DIY teeth whitening product or have it done by a professional dentist, this article will list down the advantages of teeth whitening done by an experienced professional. DIY teeth whitening kits cause teeth problems More often, DIY teeth whitening products use strong bleaching solutions to achieve the desired results. Teeth whitening products contain higher percentages of bleaching solution but the results will last for only a short period. If the patient wants to maintain whiter teeth, they have to use the product repeatedly. The problem with DIY teeth whitening products is it causes the teeth to become dehydrated, which leads to teeth sensitivity. If left untreated, this will cause extreme pain and other teeth problems. The patient may also struggle to take certain foods or drinks. Incorrect use of teeth whitening kits leads to discomfort and sensitivity. A common mistake among patients is they use the product at the wrong frequency or time. Some aren’t even aware that the bleaching solution shouldn’t touch the gum line and other parts of the oral cavity. When a professional dentist performs the treatment, you can always count on them to give the best results without harming the teeth. Dentists use professional teeth whitening products that are safe, effective, and won’t cause further damage. Professional whitening treatment is more comfortable and much safer because you can ensure a dental professional will perform the procedure and monitor the progress. The dentist will also adjust the concentration of the treatment, protect your gums and other parts of your oral cavity, and provide post-session treatment and offers suggestions to prevent tooth sensitivity. DIY teeth whitening doesn’t last long The reason people turn to teeth whitening is to achieve an aesthetically pleasing smile. To get quick results, they purchase DIY teeth whitening products, but they end up wearing off after a few weeks. This will force the patient to repeat the treatment to get long-term results. Not only will the costs add up after several years, but it’s also time-consuming since you have to keep up with the treatment to obtain the desired results. Also, not all DIY kits are 100% effective, so most dentists don’t recommend using them. Compared to DIY products, professional teeth whitening ensures quicker results that last for a long time. Dentists have access to safer and quality materials that produce lasting results than DIY or at-home teeth whitening products. On the other hand, over-the-counter treatments rely on a one-size-fits-all approach, which lacks versatility. Patients cannot customize the product according to their dental needs and whitening preference. Dentists use a customized whitening solution to give patients accurate results with safety precautions in mind. The results can last up to several years if the patient maintains good dental hygiene. Although the treatment is more costly than DIY kits, you can ensure that professional treatment is worth your money. Professional teeth whitening guarantees quick results When it comes to teeth whitening, treatments may vary for every patient, which means not everyone goes through a similar process. This is the reason users of DIY products notice they end up applying the product regularly. This will cost too much stress and hassle on the patient’s end. Meanwhile, professional teeth whitening requires a few appointments with each session that lasts over an hour. The dentist will apply the whitening treatment to the teeth, which often takes 15 to 20 minutes. Although each treatment will require you to visit the dentist, you’ll notice the results quicker than you expected. Unlike DIY kits, the patient has to invest a lot of time, effort, and money to get the results they wanted. Although teeth whitening products are convenient to use, don’t settle for less when it comes to your dental health. Nothing compares when we leave our dental concerns in the hands of an experienced dentist. With professional treatment, you can ensure you get the best services for your most important asset."
Sexual Fantasies and Root Causes of Erection Issues In Men,6523,"Erections are one of those words that have been in use since the dawn of time. When we first start having sex we are all eager to rip and plunge for lovemaking and a strong erection is the crowning glory of our sexual fantasies. However, what happens when you suffer from erection problems or if your partner doesn’t understand how to give you an orgasm? An erection is a hardening of your penis that normally happens when sponge-like tissues within the organ fill up with blood. Typically, erections cause the penile organ to stand upright and enlarge. Erections will often go away on their own after sexual intercourse or after releasing semen through the urethral opening, the tiny hole at the base of your penis. Erections that last longer than a few minutes may be abnormal and require medical intervention. For those suffering from erectile dysfunction, a main cause may be a problem with the autonomic nervous system, which controls arousal and sexual response. The autonomic nervous system has a direct control over many aspects of a person’s body including the erection. It controls the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin that triggers feelings of sexual arousal and satisfaction. Because the autonomic nervous system controls erections directly, it can be difficult for some to control their erection with sexual stimulation caused by trauma or illness such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease. Erectile dysfunction has a number of underlying causes. In men, poor sexual health can be a major factor in erectile issues, especially when diabetes or other cardiac issues arise. Poor health can also lead to decreased testosterone levels, which can weaken the erectile tissue and prevent erections from occurring. If a person is sexually inactive, their sex drive may drop to the point where they don’t experience any ejaculations. This can lead to a partner rejecting them and then either hurting themselves mentally or feeling ashamed about their inability to perform sexually. Overweight men and women can also have a difficult time getting erections. Excessive body fat can compress the pelvic region, making it difficult to have an erection, even during arousal. Men who are obese often have difficulty gaining weight and maintain a normal body weight due to their increased activity level. This same high level of activity can also cause excess stress on the urinary and digestive systems that can lead to weak urinary muscles and therefore less urine when you do urinate. Besides physical causes, some men have psychological issues that can lead to impotence or lack of desire to experience an erection. The male hormone testosterone, which is responsible for the sexual desire and strength, can change during puberty and the onset of puberty can bring about a decrease in sex drive. This physical change can also cause changes in the brain that can result in changes in how the brain reacts to sexual stimuli. Many times a man will become emotionally upset after experiencing this change in his life. This emotional disturbance can hinder his ability to maintain an erection during the act of sex. Some physical changes may also occur as a result of puberty such as the formation of the male sex organs, which make the urethra and penis smaller than normal. Erections are a normal response to physical stimuli. An erection is an alteration of the male penis that occurs when sponge-like tissue within the penis fills with blood. Usually, erections cause the penile penis to expand and stand upright outside of the body. Erections may go away by themselves or after copulation, either the involuntary release of sperm through the urethral opening, or an erection caused by sexual stimulation. Most men experience slight, temporary erections during work or exercise. However, most men experience stronger, longer-lasting erections after sex. If your partner has had nocturnal emissions, it will take longer for her to achieve an erection because during non-ejaculatory days, a man’s penis is more sensitive than a woman’s. There are several different types of erectile dysfunction, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction due to high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, diabetes, enlarged prostate, heart disease, and some mental conditions such as depression. In some cases, erections stop without any medical reason, but it advised to consult a physician such as Priority Men’s Medical Center which is a well-known men’s sexual health clinic in Atlanta. Erectile dysfunction is more common in men who smoke, use illegal drugs, have high blood pressure, have large heart problems, or diabetes. It is more common in younger men, since younger men have less chance of erectile dysfunction due to genetic factors. A neurological disorder called “anatomic neurosis” results in patients having nocturnal emission. People with this type of neurological disorder experience sudden and involuntary erection without any sexual stimulation. People with this type of neurological disorder may experience erections when they are excited, frightened, or even anxious. This disorder results from damage to the neurological pathways that allow the body to experience orgasm. Anatomic neurosis is often confused with physical causes like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease. Normally, a penis needs a normal part of the nervous system to get an erection. The normal part of this part is called the sympathetic division of the parasympathetic nervous system (SADP), which controls the process of relaxing the limbs to allow sexual arousal. If a person has SADP disorder, there will be no relaxation in the penile area during erection. This results in erection problems like the inability to get an erection, flaccidness, and limp. The limp may be noticed if the person is lying down with his legs raised while he is masturbating. Another type of neurological disorder is called “parasomnia”. A person suffering from parasomnia will not be able to have an erection because he will be having a lack of energy and/or is too sleepy to be aroused. In this case, he will not be able to have a normal parasympathetic reaction to the stimulation that allows erection. Many people who suffer from these types of disorders are also unable to control their urination or bladder control. Many times, patients are diagnosed with these conditions and are given medications for them; however, alternative treatment options such as the use of herbal supplements are available."
WHAT DOES RECOVERY AFTER FACELIFT LOOK LIKE?,2768,"When it comes to cosmetic surgery, it’s critical to have reasonable expectations. A facelift, also known as a rhytidectomy, is a procedure that can help battle the symptoms of aging in the face and neck. People with unsightly wrinkles, jowls, and sagging skin frequently choose this surgery to help them attain a more young, natural appearance. If you’re thinking about getting a facelift, it’s vital to understand not only the surgical technique but also the recovery process. Although the final effects of a facelift may take a few months to appear, the recovery period is significantly shorter. For recovery, after 2 weeks of rest, strenuous exercise can be resumed. Five to ten days following surgery, the sutures are removed. Incisions and bandages must be kept dry, and bathing and cleaning instructions must be followed. You must follow postoperative incision care and keep them clean throughout this time to avoid infection. You may feel shaky and tired after surgery. You should have arranged for relatives and friends to transport you home and to look after you on your first night back. The first day is generally when you need pain medication the most to remain on top of your suffering. Around the second or third day, your surgeon will schedule a follow-up appointment. Your surgical bandages will be removed or changed, and your wounds will be assessed. If everything appears to be in order, the surgeon will re-dress the area, go over post-operative instructions with you again, and send you on your way. This day should be rested for a week after that, although you should start to feel better and desire to walk about more. Bruising and swelling generally peak between days 3 and 4, although both will likely last for several weeks after that. If you’re having trouble sleeping, keep taking your medicine. You’ll still have swelling and bruising around the afflicted regions by week two. Some patients suffer numbness, tingling, and stiffness as a result of swelling and bruising. All of these things can happen following a facelift. Many people are feeling more like themselves by the second week, and are ready to return to work and start undertaking mild activities like walking. You will notice significant changes in their face shape. By this time, you should be able to resume exercising and enjoying activities without many, if any, visible traces of your surgery. The incision sites will be pinkish-red in color, although this will diminish with time. After one month, you should be able to resume normal activities and enjoy your new appearance. Very mild swelling, bruising, stiffness, and numbness might last for up to a year, although they are usually only apparent to you. Hence, this is the recovery process after your facelift Toronto!"

Choosing Vaping Over Cigarette This 2021,3078,"When you vape, you’re using an electronic cigarette, also known as an e-cigarette or e-cig. But, first and foremost, what is an electronic cigarette? It’s not a high-tech version of a tobacco cigarette, as many people believe. E-cigarettes emit vapor from the liquid inside, which may contain nicotine if desired. If you’re trying to stop smoking, it’s a smart way to get away from conventional cigarettes because it’s a healthier, smoke-free way to deliver nicotine. Is vaping healthier than smoking? One of the most significant and widely discussed advantages of vaping is that it is healthier than smoking. There have been several reports as well as first-hand accounts of people who feel better after switching from smoking to vaping. And another amazing thing is you can buy over 1000 different vape juices. “Many who stopped smoking and moved to vaping saw their blood vessel function increase by around 1.5 percentage points in four weeks compared to those who continued to smoke,” according to many Scientist articles. According to the same report, every 1% improvement in vascular health decreases the risk of cardiovascular events by 13%. Furthermore, though you may have recently heard some negative views on vaping in the press, Public Health England has stated that vaping is still 95 percent less harmful than smoking. If your wellbeing is a priority for you, and you’re ready to stop smoking, vaping might be the most effective way to gradually wean yourself and your body away from conventional tobacco cigarettes. Vaping is a low-cost option. When you turn from tobacco products to vaping, you should notice a significant reduction for money you spend on a daily basis. Traditional tobacco products are costly, in part because they are heavily taxed, so if you are a heavy smoker, the expense will quickly add up and become a financial burden. Although electronic vaping requires a slightly higher initial investment due to the need to purchase vape pens and other accessories, these initial investments will last a long time if you buy high-quality products and maintain them properly. As opposed to the cost of heavily smoking cigarettes, the continuing cost of these things would comfortably be less than half. Vaping does not have a harmful odor The scent is one of the most powerful deterrents to using tobacco products. When you smoke a lot of cigarettes on a regular basis, it’s difficult not to smell like an ashtray. Since tobacco smoke has a strong odor that lingers, it can be bothersome not only to you but also to those who aren’t smokers. Since you inhale vapor rather than smoke when you vape, you can avoid the odor of a cigarette when you turn to vaping. When vaping, you can emit a light scent of the E Liquid you’re using, but it’s not as strong or unpleasant as cigarette smoke, and it doesn’t linger. When you turn to vaping, you will get rid of the smell and be certain that your non-smokers can appreciate it. E Liquid is available online Over 100 e liquid flavors to choose from and Delicious e liquids to buy online, win–*win situation."

Exploring Hunger Control with Melanotan-2 Melanotan-2, or MT-2, is a synthetic peptide that was developed by researchers at the University of Arizona in the 1980s. In tests done on rodents, there was good evidence to suggest that MT-2 reduced fat storage and hunger behavior. In the rats that were given MT-2, there was a marked reduction in how much food they ate and it changed their preference for fatty foods. MT2 accomplishes this by regulating food cravings similar to the way the hormone leptin does. Leptin is often called the satiety hormone because it gives a feeling of fullness and interrupts what could be destructive cravings. Melanotan 2 is not yet approved by the FDA. Although this peptide requires more research, it has many different future possibilities for medical use.

Erotic Massage Secrets You Need To Try,3221,"Sensual massage is a great way to excite a partner, show him care, and surprise him with the sweetness of relaxation after a hard day. Besides, a good erotic massage is a great way to diversify intimate life. Before starting the intimate caressing, it is very important to take care of several things that will make the evening unforgettable. So, let’s have a detailed look at the secrets of a good erotic massage. Those are: The most important thing in the process is the atmosphere! Therefore, preparation is an essential part of the procedure. For massage, a bed is great if it is large and has a good mattress. A floor covered with a soft coat will also do. The main condition is that the man should be comfortable and cozy in the room. Mute the light in the room, light scented candles, turn on relaxing music in the background – all this will additionally affect the relaxation of the partner. Massage oil is also a very important item. But to use it properly you should know how to do it. The first rule is that the more oil is used – the better. Secondly, if the massage includes a happy ending, special intimate massage oil is used (if you want to give the erotic massage by yourself, you can easily buy it in any sex shop). In addition, specialized massage oils in most cases have a pleasant smell, so organs of smell will enjoy the procedure too, which will bring additional pleasant sensations. The feet are one of the most erogenic zones on the human body, a large number of nerve endings are concentrated there. In addition, foot massage itself is a rather rare kind of caressing, and therefore very intimate. So, a great thing is to start the erotic massage session with it. Having massaged feet, an experienced masseuse will move to the back. Shoulders, back, and lower back are most stressed during the day, so caressing these areas is extremely important. It’s better to start with gentle strokes along the back, from the neck to the coccyx. When massaging the neck, it is better to limit yourself to ordinary strokes, but the shoulders and lower back can be massaged more intensively. Special attention should be paid to the lower back. There are many nerve endings located there, the stimulation of which promotes active circulation in the pelvic organs, which is important for erection. Body to body massage is a nice ending to ordinary massage. As a rule, after such a tender caressing, the man is very aroused and ready for erotic continuation. When a man is already quite excited, it is very important to catch this moment, because sexual arousal may go down if the penis and testicles are not stimulated. At the moment when the masseuse realizes that the man is at the peak of excitement, the final phase of massage begins. An experienced masseuse can make a man experience an orgasm in minutes, but she’ll never do it. Long-lasting sweet torturing is much better, right? So, at the final stage of the massage, the girl uses either her hands or her body parts (or both) to stimulate the man’s penis, testicles, and prostate (if a man desires it). In SweetTouch Paris, you can experience all these massage secrets. With incredibly beautiful SweetTouch girls, this experience will be one of a kind."

What You Need To Know About Telemedicine In Health Insurance,3176,"Even as 2020 is almost drawing to a close, the COVID 19 pandemic is not yet showing any signs of abating. With social distancing measures still being enforced, it is wise to go out only when really necessary. In fact, hospitals and clinics now encourage patients to turn to telemedicine services for instant access to medical care. And in order to support this initiative, the IRDAI has now instructed insurers to include coverage for telemedicine in health insurance policies where OPD is covered. So, what is telemedicine? Telemedicine refers to the use of digital or electronic platforms for healthcare service, in situations where the doctor and their patient cannot meet in person. One of the most common ways of accessing telemedicine is through video consultations with the doctor. They can offer a professional diagnosis in real time and only ask you to come in for a face-to-face meeting if absolutely necessary (if you need any additional tests). The importance of telemedicine during COVID 19 At present, it is not advisable to simply walk into a hospital or clinic for a diagnosis. If you are COVID 19 positive, you may infect others; if you aren’t, you may pick up an infection. Telemedicine is helping make healthcare services accessible to everyone from the safety of their homes. It is also preventing hospitals and medical centres from getting overcrowded with walk-in patients. People can reach out to their doctors via online consultation and only head over for tests, if required. Moreover, telemedicine is also helping keep vulnerable sections of the population safe from infection. For instance, pregnant women can avoid stepping out for their regular check-ups and instead connect with their doctor online. The inclusion of telemedicine in health insurance As per recent instructions from the IRDAI, insurers covering medical consultations in their health insurance policies must also include telemedicine charges too for coverage.  So, if OPD forms a part of your health insurance, telemedicine charges would get covered under this section. Do keep in mind that telemedicine charges too would be subject to the normal sub-limits set by the insurer for medical consultation coverage in your health insurance policy. Any charges incurred by the policyholder for telemedicine can be filed as per the normal claims process set by the insurer. This new directive set by the IRDAI widens the scope of OPD coverage in health insurance. It would also make sense to look for OPD/medical consultation coverage when buying or renewing health insurance. Quite often, medical consultations can run into several thousand rupees. Getting coverage for these charges in your health insurance can prove to be a huge boon. Moreover, we do not know how long the pandemic will last. Thus, at some point, most of us will need to turn to telemedicine to access healthcare, as required. Knowing that such services are covered can prove to be a huge boon in these trying times. We hope that this article will help you gain an improved understanding of telemedicine in health insurance. We encourage you to stay indoors and use technology to reach out to your doctor. Take care."

If you fail to rest, not only are you robbing your injury of crucial recovery time, but you’re also likely stressing the injury or risking additional injuries as other parts of your body compensate. If, for instance, your shoulder is injured, you may end up placing more weight on your other shoulder, which increases the risk of injury to the shoulder, your back, and even your legs. Eat Nutrient-Rich Foods The food you eat is the fuel your body will use to heal an injury. If you’re constantly eating junk foods like candy, bad carbs, and other snacks, your body has to work harder to break them down. When you eat healthy foods like vegetables, meats, healthy fats, and foods high in protein, you supercharge your body’s ability to heal. These types of foods also have a rich supply of vitamins that boost your immune system, optimize blood flow, and promote blood vessel growth. You’ll feel better and your body will get better faster. Supplement Your Diet with Vitamin Supplements Eating the right foods and getting your diet in order is a great first step to protecting your body and giving it the resources, it needs to heal. You can, however, turbocharge your healing by taking supplements that will add to your total vitamin count and make more vitamins bioavailable for your body to use. Things like Vitamin C and Vitamin E promote your immune response and reduce inflammation. Vitamin K can help push more oxygen into your blood and increase hemoglobin. Many supplements promote healing available online at affordable costs. Peptides and Healing Researchers are giving more time and resources to exploring how peptides may promote the healing process. One peptide in particular, BPC-157 from www.peptidesciences.com, is a derivative of body protection compound, or BPC. BPC is a protein found in the human digestive tract that protects the gastrointestinal lining from any damage. It also encourages blood vessel growth. In clinical tests done on rodents, BPC-157 showed positive results when it came to the coagulation process, immune system function, blood vessel growth, and other aspects of wound healing. The research is giving new insight into wider applications that can help injuries heal faster. Mind the Mental as well as the Physical While your top concerns should be getting the right treatment and recovery plan, there are also things you can do mentally to help your body heal. One of the biggest health detractors is modern-day stress. Things like financial worries, family confrontations, long commutes, work stress, and other stressors can hurt your physical health. They raise your blood pressure and cause inflammation. If you want to gain an edge on healing faster, removing outside sources of stress is a great choice. Do your best to foster a peaceful, wholesome environment without too many outside stimulants to distract your mind and body. Dealing with an injury requires a comprehensive approach. Yes, most injuries eventually heal, but how long they take to heal will depend on the steps you take to administer self-care. Work with your medical support system on a plan that fits your lifestyle and needs. Not everyone can stay at home or go to physical therapy sessions every day of the week. Do your best to create a plan that fits your life and do your best to promote a healthy lifestyle. You’ll be back to normal before you know it and with full recovery, you can keep working to make your body stronger than ever. Staying healthy is, after all, the best way to prevent injury."

Aid group says WHO is restricting access to Ebola vaccines in Congo,2507,"A rigid system of eligibility set by the World Health Organization means far too few people at risk of Ebola are being vaccinated in an outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo, the aid group MSF said on Monday. The medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) said its efforts to get more people to be given the vaccine – developed by the U.S. drugmaker Merck (MRK.N) and being used in emergency plans in the Congo epidemic – were being frustrated by “tight controls on supply and eligibility criteria imposed by the WHO”. “Time is of essence in an outbreak: medical teams should be able to rapidly provide treatments or vaccines based on what they see on the ground,” MSF’s emergency coordinator Natalie Roberts said in a statement. “But our capacity… is severely undermined by a rigid system which is hard to comprehend.” The WHO denied it was rationing the vaccine and said it was working as hard as any organization to end Congo’s deadly Ebola outbreak. “We partner closely with the DRC government to reach as many communities and individuals in the outbreak area as possible and are not limiting access to vaccine,” it said. The Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year, second only to the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The WHO and the Congolese health ministry say that since August 2018, more than 223,000 people have been vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV, the Merck vaccine that has been shown in clinical trials to be highly protective against Ebola infection. Congo health authorities also gave the go-ahead on Saturday for plans to introduce a second Ebola vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), to help fight the outbreak. The Merck shot is being deployed in a strategy known as “ring vaccination”, which aims to control Ebola by identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts of those likely to be infected. The WHO said that because Ebola spreads via person-to-person contact, this is “the most effective means of stopping” its spread, but MSF’s Roberts likened the situation to “giving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day”. The WHO said the Merck vaccine eligibility and strategy were recommended by independent specialists in agreement with Congo. The plan with addition of the J&J vaccine, it said, is to extend protection by providing it to “targeted at-risk populations” in areas where the disease is not yet being actively transmitted."
A common numbing medication turned a woman’s blood blue,1359,"In Rhode Island, a 25-year-old woman gave a new meaning to the phrase ‘feeling blue’. She developed a rare and sometimes incurable condition called methemoglobinemia that turned her blood a shade of navy blue. The case was described on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and told the doctors that for a toothache she had used a topical pain reliever. The morning she woke up feeling sick and went to the emergency room.  As per Dr. Otis Warren, an ER physician at Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island, she told emergency room doctors, ‘I am weak and I am blue.’ The initial reading showed that her blood oxygen level was 88% that is lower than the normal, although higher than what doctors estimated given her appearance. Dr. Otis Warren immediately recognized the problem that it is methemoglobinemia. He told, ‘The skin color looked just the same.’ ‘You see it one time, and it stays in your mind.’ Methemoglobinemia happens when the iron in a blood changes form and, as a consequence, can no longer bind to oxygen and carry it throughout the body.  In the case of a woman, she hadn’t taken an antibiotic. She had used an over-the-counter anesthetizing medication, which contained benzocaine, to reduce the tooth pain. She told to Dr. Warren that she didn’t use the entire bottle, but it was clear to him that she had ‘used a complete lot of it.’  "
Texas girl contracts brain-eating amoeba during swim in river,1022,"A young Texas girl is fighting for her life after she was infected with a deadly brain-eating amoeba following a day spent swimming in a river, according to reports. Lily Mae Avant, 10, went swimming over Labor Day weekend in the Brazos River near Waco — where doctors believe she contracted the often-fatal Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Days after her swim, the Valley Mills Elementary School student started experiencing a fever and a headache, according to the station. Though she appeared to be suffering from symptoms of a common virus, her family said they still believed that “something was not quite right,” according to a Facebook page launched to support Lily. Then one night, Lily’s mother heard concerning noises coming from her daughter’s room. “She was incoherent, unresponsive and was quickly swept up and taken to the ER,” the page said. Lily was then flown to Cook Children’s Heath Care System in Forth Worth, where a spinal tap revealed she had contracted Naegleriasis, a rare infection caused by the amoeba."
10-year-old Texas girl contracts brain-eating amoeba while swimming,1599,"A weekend swim left a young girl fighting for her life when she contracted a brain-eating amoeba with a 97% fatality rate. The 10-year-old girl swam in the Brazos River and Lake Whitney in Bosque County near Waco over Labor Day weekend, according to a report. Then, on September 8, the girl “began having a headache, and it was quickly followed by a fever,” according to a Facebook page created to support the girl. Her family thought it was a viral infection at first, but after visits to the family doctor and the girl having trouble sleeping, the family knew something was wrong. “She was incoherent, unresponsive and was quickly swept up and taken to the ER,” the family wrote on the girl’s Facebook page. The girl was then flown to Cook Children’s Health Care System in Fort Worth where a spinal tap found she had contracted Naegleria fowleri. “It’s every parent’s worst nightmare,” the girl’s aunt, Crystal Warren, told Friday. “For this to happen to her when there were so many other people in the same waters on the same days we just don’t understand why it was her.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the amoeba is a single-cell living organism commonly found in warm freshwater like lakes and rivers. The amoeba enters the body through the nose, travels to the brain and destroys brain tissue, according to the CDC. Between 2009 and 2018, the CDC says only 34 cases of the Naegleria fowleri infection were reported in the US. Only four people out of the 145 known cases survived between 1962 and 2018. Warren told she’s hopeful her niece “will be number five to survive.”"
CDC revises down number of vaping-related illnesses across U.S.,2396,"The U.S. government has refined how it is evaluating an outbreak of breathing illnesses in people who vape, now counting only cases that are most closely linked to electronic cigarette use. Health officials on Thursday said 380 confirmed cases and probable cases have been reported in 36 states and one U.S. territory. That marks a decrease from the 450 cited last week, when officials were also including “possible” cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state officials have been investigating an outbreak that began materializing in the Midwest in July. Doctors say the illnesses seemsto be an inhalation injury, with the body apparently reacting to a caustic substance that someone breathed in. Symptoms have included shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Many young and previously healthy adolescents and young adults required machines to help them breathe. Six deaths have been reported, all adults and at least some with pre-existing lung problems or other conditions that may have made them more prone. The illnesses are seen as a new phenomenon, and it’s taken weeks for CDC officials to come up with a case definition and for states to start following it. Thursday’s tally from the CDC was the first based on the new case definition, which counts only breathing illnesses with abnormal chest X-rays, a recent history of vaping, and lab work done to rule out infectious diseases or other possible causes. No single device, liquid or ingredient has been identified as the cause, and health officials are advising people not to vape at all until more is known. The states reporting vaping-related lung illnesses to the CDC are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia — plus the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some other states have announced they are investigating possible vaping illnesses, but have not yet told CDC that those illnesses met case definitions for confirmed or probable cases, CDC officials said. The deaths, previously reported, were in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota and Oregon."
Questions surround cause of vaping-related illnesses as local man hospitalized,2859,"As the federal government proposes a crackdown on vaping, local hospitals are now seeing cases of vaping-related illnesses. President Donald Trump announced a new enforcement proposal Tuesday that would require e-cigarette companies to take their flavored products off the market. This comes amid a reported outbreak of mysterious respiratory illnesses across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted at least 450 cases in 33 states, including six deaths, which are all linked to e-cigarettes. One of those cases involves a local man who just spent more than a week in the Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital. “He came in with some shortness of breath,” said Dr. Shawn Varney, an emergency room doctor at University Hospital and professor of Emergency Medicine at UT Health San Antonio. “And during the course of his hospital stay, he deteriorated.” After originally showing up with flu-like symptoms, the young man started breathing more rapidly and complained of a lack of oxygen, said Dr. Varney. “Over a short period, he wound up needing to have assistance on breathing. He had to have a breathing tube and was put on a ventilator.” As a medical toxicologist and director of the South Texas Poison Center, Dr. Varney had a hunch about what may have been contributing to his illness. He thought it might be connected to vaping. “But by the time we were considering this as a diagnosis, we had already intubated him, so we couldn’t ask him,” he said. “We had to wait until after he recovered over that week and had the breathing tube removed,” and that’s when he said the patient confirmed it. “We had a come-to-Jesus talk. We said, ‘This is what we’re seeing. What are you doing?’ And he went, ‘Ok, yeah. I use all the time.'” Dr. Varney said the patient also fit the same demographic as the majority of the other people coming down with these vaping-related illnesses. “These are young kids in their 20’s, no medical problems, absolutely no reason to come down with such a severe disease.” The cause of the recent nationwide outbreak remains a mystery, but officials have said most were vaping THC – the source of marijuana’s high – or a combination of nicotine and THC. “We suspect that a good source would be coming from the streets,” said Dr. Varney. “Specifically marijuana. THC. People obtain the product and then they put it in their own chambers so they can vape.” “Off the street, unregulated THC cartridges,” said Brandon Berube, general manager of Hazel Sky Smoke Shop off Fredericksburg Road. “I pray there is more clarification in the future.” Clarification about the difference between store-bought cartridges and modified street-bought e-cigs. “Store-bought is fully regulated. You’re going to get a good clean product,” he said. “With street-bought, you’re getting stuff people made in their bath tub.”"
5 Tips to Help With Drug Addiction Recovery,3898,"The process of drug addiction recovery involves a lot of work. As much as you receive medical care and treatment from the rehab facility, there are also roles that you must play for the process to pay off in the end. The last thing that a patient, their family, and community want is the case of relapse. For this reason, finding ways to stay sober and concentrate on the recovery process has become important. Here are the tips to help with drug addiction recovery. To concentrate on the recovery process and avoid relapse, you must understand your external triggers and work on them as the patient. These can be things, people, places, and situations that bring out thoughts, cravings, emotions, or feelings associated with substance use. The internal and external triggers play a big part in making the recovery process overwhelming. When you identify these risks, developing a plan to help you avoid them or seek help becomes possible. During the recovery process, stress, financial difficulties, environmental cues, and relationship problems are the common triggers that you should be aware of. Until you experience withdrawal syndrome, they will just be words to you as a patient. The post-withdrawal symptoms can last for months, making it hard to handle the recovery process. These symptoms, in most cases, can be overwhelming, especially in an uncontrolled environment. Seeking knowledge and preparing for the withdrawal syndrome is one way of handling the drug addiction recovery process well. You need your body and mind ready for what will come next as soon as you start the detox and treatment process. Let medical specialists guide you on what to expect and how best to prepare. After the addiction treatment center or rehab facility, getting back home to a familiar environment can have varying impacts on the recovery process. You must remain resolute and dedicated to the treatment and recovery process. For this reason, you must avoid old routines and habits. While at first it can prove hectic, understand that old routines and habits can come between you and the recovery efforts. Talk to counselors and therapists and get guidance on making positive changes in your routine and habits. Have a change of routine and habits both at home and in the workplace. Your time in an addiction treatment center or rehab facility should help you understand how unhealthy relationships contribute to your addiction. The relationship you had with drug dealers or friends at the bars was the reason for your current situation. You must part ways with your previous relationships and focus on building new healthy ones to achieve your recovery objectives. When you build healthy relationships, you also find effective ways to handle external triggers, lowering relapse chances.

What Does Tadalafil Do for a Woman?,2678,"The tadanafil powder produces tadalafil medicine. Tadalafil is a medication that is used to treat erection issues (erectile dysfunction) as well as symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostate enlargement). It is also used to treat pulmonary hypertension on occasion (high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs). Tadalafil is only available with a prescription. It comes in the form of tablets that you take with water. It is safe to take with or without food. Specific drugs should not be taken at or near the time of eating food, or when consuming certain types of food, because interactions may occur. Using alcohol or smoke in conjunction with some medications may also result in interactions. Keep the medication in a tightly sealed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Prevent the freezer from freezing. Keep out of children’s reach. Do not keep out-of-date or no-longer-needed medications. Tadalafil is also used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension in both men and women in order to increase your capacity to exercise. This is excessive blood pressure that occurs in the major artery that transports blood from the ventricle on the right side of the heart to the lungs. When the smaller blood capillaries in the lungs become less permeable to blood flow, the right ventricle has to work harder to push enough blood through the lungs. Tadalafil relaxes blood arteries by acting on the PDE5 enzyme in the lungs. This increases the supply of blood to the lungs while decreasing the workload on the heart. Tadalafil is not suggested during pregnancy or breastfeeding if you have pulmonary hypertension. There is no convincing evidence that tadalafil helps women with sexual issues. Tadalafil is only available to people above the age of 18. Some people should not take tadalafil. You should not use tadalafil if you are: Tadalafil, like all medications, might cause negative effects in some people. Many people experience no or moderate negative effects. More than one out of every hundred persons will experience a common adverse effect. As the dose is increased, the side effects may become more severe. If you experience adverse effects such as headaches, nausea, red or flushed skin, indigestion, stuffy nose, or muscle aches, continue taking the medication, but notify your doctor or pharmacist if they disturb you or do not go away. Some major side effects include a sudden difficulty with your eyesight or hearing, a serious skin response – symptoms may include red raised patches on your skin or red spots (hives), a swollen face and swelling around the eyes, or convulsions or fits."
Innovative Technologies that Changed the Healthcare Industry,5366,"Developments in technology transformed the healthcare industry at a time that it needed the most. The pandemic compelled healthcare professionals and their patients to make adjustments to avoid getting infected. One of these adjustments was telemedicine that allowed patients to consult their doctors even without visiting the clinic or medical facility. Aside from telemedicine, the healthcare industry also adopted other innovative technologies that enhanced its operations. From patient management to augmented reality in medical procedures, these technologies allowed the industry to develop by leaps and bounds. Here are some innovative technologies that changed the healthcare industry. Nanomedicine Nanomedicine is the use of nanotechnology in the healthcare industry. It aims to prevent and treat diseases using the tools and knowledge of nanotechnology. It involves using materials at the nanometric scale in different fields of medicine. The technology has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It also aims to deliver drugs using precise delivery systems, leading to personalized and targeted delivery of medicines without affecting the other parts of the body. For instance, it can deliver chemotherapy straight to the tumor without impacting the rest of the body. Nanomedicine has several products going through clinical trials for many major diseases, including inflammatory, musculoskeletal, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular. This branch of medicine already has products in the market for diagnostics and medical imaging. Surgical Management System A surgical management system allows hospitals to enhance the efficiency of their operations and automate patient communication. It also provides consistent perioperative care or the care a patient receives at the time of the surgery. This type of care typically starts when the patient first enters the hospital for the procedure until the patient goes home. The system also incorporates anesthesiology practice management software to help anesthesiologists take better care of patients. It removes the administrative tasks from the doctors so that they can focus on taking care of the patient. The software works on providing all the necessary information about the patient to ensure the medical professionals have an idea about the patient’s status. Patient Management Through IoT The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare ensures the patients are well-taken care of while under the supervision of a healthcare professional. It facilitates real-time monitoring of patients and provides healthcare professionals access to health data whenever necessary. Patient interaction with the doctor is no longer limited to physical visits or even telemedicine services. The use of wearable sensors allows doctors to have continuous access to the health status of the patient. Whether they are at home or in the hospital, the doctors can check the data collected by these sensors to identify the patient’s best treatment. Hospitals can also use IoT to monitor the location of medical equipment within their premises. Administrators can also analyze the proper deployment of staff in the hospital at any given time using the technology. Additionally, they can manage assets properly and in real-time, such as the temperature and humidity of the refrigerator where they store the medicine. This is useful at this time since some vaccines require a certain temperature to retain their efficacy. Precision Medicine The lifestyle, genetic makeup, and environment of an individual can affect the diagnosis and treatment of his condition. Precision medicine is an approach that focuses on these variables in the treatment and preventive care of an individual. Using this approach allows medical professionals to use accurate prevention and treatment strategies in certain groups of people. It does not subscribe to the one-size-fits-all approach in medicine. The approach takes into account the differences between two different patients. With this, it can change the measures used to treat illnesses. It can also reduce treatment time for each patient. Even though precision medicine is a new term, its concept has been used in the healthcare industry for a long time. One good example is blood transfusion. Healthcare professionals do not give blood to a person that comes from a random donor. Instead, they match the blood type of the donor with the blood type of the patient. Researchers are now aiming to expand its use to other areas of the healthcare industry. Augmented Reality in Surgery Augmented reality in surgery uses special software and hardware that provides surgeons with computer-generated data in real-time. The system combines computer-generated images with real-life objects. The use of the technology in surgical practice gained a lot of interest since it may be useful, as shown in pre-clinical research. It can also lead to better accuracy in positioning while reducing radiation in different orthopedic procedures. Despite these positive notes, concerns emerged about the accuracy of the images shown on the screen. While it can be a useful tool for training, more research is required before being fully used on actual surgeries. The healthcare industry will continue to improve as more innovations in technology will emerge in the next few years."
How Aesthetic Lasers are Used,3315,"Laser treatment has experienced tremendous changes in recent years. Its evolvement helps people live more comfortably and less conscious about their looks. Lasers are widely used to treat various conditions, ranging from acne, scars, warts, wrinkles, and more. They are common in different medicine sectors, like dentistry, surgery, dermatology, and cosmetic procedures. The lasers used in cosmetic procedures are referred to as aesthetic lasers. Aesthetic lasers-How do they work? Aesthetic lasers are potent tools in cosmetic procedures. They are used in hair removal, skin resurfacing, tattoo removal, and many more. Aesthetic lasers generate an intense beam of light over a short distance during skin treatment. They destruct skin lesions without interfering with the skin tissue in surrounding areas. What’s more? Lasers stimulate the growth of fibroblasts which encourage new collagen growth. This results in firmer and younger-looking skin. For excellent results, it’s advisable to go for licensed cosmetic lasers, and this is why most practitioners choose Sentient Lasers. They also come in different models and sizes to match your cosmetic needs. How are aesthetic lasers used? Laser hair removal is surgery for alleviating unwanted body hairs from the skin. Laser beams focus on individual strands to remove hair painlessly and permanently. The procedure damages the hair follicles and the shaft, making the hair fall out by itself and not grow back. Once the follicles are damaged, the hair is unable to grow back. Some modern hair removal procedures use the picosecond aesthetic laser. The device is ultrafast and is quicker than the standard laser. In some cases, lasers are used to boost hair growth. They stimulate healing to damaged hair follicles and promote new growth. Breast augmentation is a procedure that uses low laser energy and is non-invasive. In the process, the laser moves across the chest to tighten the breast tissue and boost cell growth. Laser breast augmentation is effective in enhancing the look and contour of your breasts. Also, lasers are widely used in other conventional breast surgeries to alleviate pain and inflammation after operation. Laser liposuction is safer compared to the traditional liposuction method. The procedure alters fat cells below the skin’s surface, leading to emulsification. That’s not all, though! The liquefied fat is then reabsorbed and eliminated by the body through normal processes or detox programs. Unlike the traditional liposuction methods, lasers tighten the skin with minimal trauma inflicted on the body. And this means speedy recovery since there are no stitches involved. Lasers are popularly used in tattoo removal and offer better results. Laser tattoo removal is less painful with minimal chances of scarring. These machines break up the ink particles in the tattoo without damaging the surrounding areas. However, the ink color and the tattoo size determine the number of laser treatments required. The bottom line Aesthetic lasers are useful in cosmetic procedures like tattoo removal, breast augmentation, hair removal, and more. These machines are faster and promise better results, meaning you don’t have to stay in bed for weeks after the surgery. However, practitioners should acquire such lasers from reputed manufacturers."
Why Professional Teeth Whitening Is More Effective Than DIY Kits,5140,"Our smiles are one of the first things people notice about us and the key to making a great first impression. People are willing to invest in their dental procedures to get the best dental treatment from dependable dentists. Among these dental services, teeth whitening is an increasingly popular treatment among people who want a whiter and brighter smile. In recent years, DIY teeth whitening products have been hitting grocery shelves and late-night infomercials. Images of young people flaunting their pearly white smiles are filling our social media feed while holding teeth whitening kits, pens, strips, and LED trays. All these have spurred people’s obsession to achieve an attractive smile. Although over-the-counter whitening kits are affordable and convenient to use, these products don’t offer the benefits offered by professional teeth whitening. While most people are expecting decent and quick outcomes from at-home products, they don’t compare to the many benefits professional teeth whitening offers. If you’re deciding whether to buy a DIY teeth whitening product or have it done by a professional dentist, this article will list down the advantages of teeth whitening done by an experienced professional. DIY teeth whitening kits cause teeth problems More often, DIY teeth whitening products use strong bleaching solutions to achieve the desired results. Teeth whitening products contain higher percentages of bleaching solution but the results will last for only a short period. If the patient wants to maintain whiter teeth, they have to use the product repeatedly. The problem with DIY teeth whitening products is it causes the teeth to become dehydrated, which leads to teeth sensitivity. If left untreated, this will cause extreme pain and other teeth problems. The patient may also struggle to take certain foods or drinks. Incorrect use of teeth whitening kits leads to discomfort and sensitivity. A common mistake among patients is they use the product at the wrong frequency or time. Some aren’t even aware that the bleaching solution shouldn’t touch the gum line and other parts of the oral cavity. When a professional dentist performs the treatment, you can always count on them to give the best results without harming the teeth. Dentists use professional teeth whitening products that are safe, effective, and won’t cause further damage. Professional whitening treatment is more comfortable and much safer because you can ensure a dental professional will perform the procedure and monitor the progress. The dentist will also adjust the concentration of the treatment, protect your gums and other parts of your oral cavity, and provide post-session treatment and offers suggestions to prevent tooth sensitivity. DIY teeth whitening doesn’t last long The reason people turn to teeth whitening is to achieve an aesthetically pleasing smile. To get quick results, they purchase DIY teeth whitening products, but they end up wearing off after a few weeks. This will force the patient to repeat the treatment to get long-term results. Not only will the costs add up after several years, but it’s also time-consuming since you have to keep up with the treatment to obtain the desired results. Also, not all DIY kits are 100% effective, so most dentists don’t recommend using them. Compared to DIY products, professional teeth whitening ensures quicker results that last for a long time. Dentists have access to safer and quality materials that produce lasting results than DIY or at-home teeth whitening products. On the other hand, over-the-counter treatments rely on a one-size-fits-all approach, which lacks versatility. Patients cannot customize the product according to their dental needs and whitening preference. Dentists use a customized whitening solution to give patients accurate results with safety precautions in mind. The results can last up to several years if the patient maintains good dental hygiene. Although the treatment is more costly than DIY kits, you can ensure that professional treatment is worth your money. Professional teeth whitening guarantees quick results When it comes to teeth whitening, treatments may vary for every patient, which means not everyone goes through a similar process. This is the reason users of DIY products notice they end up applying the product regularly. This will cost too much stress and hassle on the patient’s end. Meanwhile, professional teeth whitening requires a few appointments with each session that lasts over an hour. The dentist will apply the whitening treatment to the teeth, which often takes 15 to 20 minutes. Although each treatment will require you to visit the dentist, you’ll notice the results quicker than you expected. Unlike DIY kits, the patient has to invest a lot of time, effort, and money to get the results they wanted. Although teeth whitening products are convenient to use, don’t settle for less when it comes to your dental health. Nothing compares when we leave our dental concerns in the hands of an experienced dentist. With professional treatment, you can ensure you get the best services for your most important asset."
Sexual Fantasies and Root Causes of Erection Issues In Men,6523,"Erections are one of those words that have been in use since the dawn of time. When we first start having sex we are all eager to rip and plunge for lovemaking and a strong erection is the crowning glory of our sexual fantasies. However, what happens when you suffer from erection problems or if your partner doesn’t understand how to give you an orgasm? An erection is a hardening of your penis that normally happens when sponge-like tissues within the organ fill up with blood. Typically, erections cause the penile organ to stand upright and enlarge. Erections will often go away on their own after sexual intercourse or after releasing semen through the urethral opening, the tiny hole at the base of your penis. Erections that last longer than a few minutes may be abnormal and require medical intervention. For those suffering from erectile dysfunction, a main cause may be a problem with the autonomic nervous system, which controls arousal and sexual response. The autonomic nervous system has a direct control over many aspects of a person’s body including the erection. It controls the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin that triggers feelings of sexual arousal and satisfaction. Because the autonomic nervous system controls erections directly, it can be difficult for some to control their erection with sexual stimulation caused by trauma or illness such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease. Erectile dysfunction has a number of underlying causes. In men, poor sexual health can be a major factor in erectile issues, especially when diabetes or other cardiac issues arise. Poor health can also lead to decreased testosterone levels, which can weaken the erectile tissue and prevent erections from occurring. If a person is sexually inactive, their sex drive may drop to the point where they don’t experience any ejaculations. This can lead to a partner rejecting them and then either hurting themselves mentally or feeling ashamed about their inability to perform sexually. Overweight men and women can also have a difficult time getting erections. Excessive body fat can compress the pelvic region, making it difficult to have an erection, even during arousal. Men who are obese often have difficulty gaining weight and maintain a normal body weight due to their increased activity level. This same high level of activity can also cause excess stress on the urinary and digestive systems that can lead to weak urinary muscles and therefore less urine when you do urinate. Besides physical causes, some men have psychological issues that can lead to impotence or lack of desire to experience an erection. The male hormone testosterone, which is responsible for the sexual desire and strength, can change during puberty and the onset of puberty can bring about a decrease in sex drive. This physical change can also cause changes in the brain that can result in changes in how the brain reacts to sexual stimuli. Many times a man will become emotionally upset after experiencing this change in his life. This emotional disturbance can hinder his ability to maintain an erection during the act of sex. Some physical changes may also occur as a result of puberty such as the formation of the male sex organs, which make the urethra and penis smaller than normal. Erections are a normal response to physical stimuli. An erection is an alteration of the male penis that occurs when sponge-like tissue within the penis fills with blood. Usually, erections cause the penile penis to expand and stand upright outside of the body. Erections may go away by themselves or after copulation, either the involuntary release of sperm through the urethral opening, or an erection caused by sexual stimulation. Most men experience slight, temporary erections during work or exercise. However, most men experience stronger, longer-lasting erections after sex. If your partner has had nocturnal emissions, it will take longer for her to achieve an erection because during non-ejaculatory days, a man’s penis is more sensitive than a woman’s. There are several different types of erectile dysfunction, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction due to high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, diabetes, enlarged prostate, heart disease, and some mental conditions such as depression. In some cases, erections stop without any medical reason, but it advised to consult a physician such as Priority Men’s Medical Center which is a well-known men’s sexual health clinic in Atlanta. Erectile dysfunction is more common in men who smoke, use illegal drugs, have high blood pressure, have large heart problems, or diabetes. It is more common in younger men, since younger men have less chance of erectile dysfunction due to genetic factors. A neurological disorder called “anatomic neurosis” results in patients having nocturnal emission. People with this type of neurological disorder experience sudden and involuntary erection without any sexual stimulation. People with this type of neurological disorder may experience erections when they are excited, frightened, or even anxious. This disorder results from damage to the neurological pathways that allow the body to experience orgasm. Anatomic neurosis is often confused with physical causes like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease. Normally, a penis needs a normal part of the nervous system to get an erection. The normal part of this part is called the sympathetic division of the parasympathetic nervous system (SADP), which controls the process of relaxing the limbs to allow sexual arousal. If a person has SADP disorder, there will be no relaxation in the penile area during erection. This results in erection problems like the inability to get an erection, flaccidness, and limp. The limp may be noticed if the person is lying down with his legs raised while he is masturbating. Another type of neurological disorder is called “parasomnia”. A person suffering from parasomnia will not be able to have an erection because he will be having a lack of energy and/or is too sleepy to be aroused. In this case, he will not be able to have a normal parasympathetic reaction to the stimulation that allows erection. Many people who suffer from these types of disorders are also unable to control their urination or bladder control. Many times, patients are diagnosed with these conditions and are given medications for them; however, alternative treatment options such as the use of herbal supplements are available."
WHAT DOES RECOVERY AFTER FACELIFT LOOK LIKE?,2768,"When it comes to cosmetic surgery, it’s critical to have reasonable expectations. A facelift, also known as a rhytidectomy, is a procedure that can help battle the symptoms of aging in the face and neck. People with unsightly wrinkles, jowls, and sagging skin frequently choose this surgery to help them attain a more young, natural appearance. If you’re thinking about getting a facelift, it’s vital to understand not only the surgical technique but also the recovery process. Although the final effects of a facelift may take a few months to appear, the recovery period is significantly shorter. For recovery, after 2 weeks of rest, strenuous exercise can be resumed. Five to ten days following surgery, the sutures are removed. Incisions and bandages must be kept dry, and bathing and cleaning instructions must be followed. You must follow postoperative incision care and keep them clean throughout this time to avoid infection. You may feel shaky and tired after surgery. You should have arranged for relatives and friends to transport you home and to look after you on your first night back. The first day is generally when you need pain medication the most to remain on top of your suffering. Around the second or third day, your surgeon will schedule a follow-up appointment. Your surgical bandages will be removed or changed, and your wounds will be assessed. If everything appears to be in order, the surgeon will re-dress the area, go over post-operative instructions with you again, and send you on your way. This day should be rested for a week after that, although you should start to feel better and desire to walk about more. Bruising and swelling generally peak between days 3 and 4, although both will likely last for several weeks after that. If you’re having trouble sleeping, keep taking your medicine. You’ll still have swelling and bruising around the afflicted regions by week two. Some patients suffer numbness, tingling, and stiffness as a result of swelling and bruising. All of these things can happen following a facelift. Many people are feeling more like themselves by the second week, and are ready to return to work and start undertaking mild activities like walking. You will notice significant changes in their face shape. By this time, you should be able to resume exercising and enjoying activities without many, if any, visible traces of your surgery. The incision sites will be pinkish-red in color, although this will diminish with time. After one month, you should be able to resume normal activities and enjoy your new appearance. Very mild swelling, bruising, stiffness, and numbness might last for up to a year, although they are usually only apparent to you. Hence, this is the recovery process after your facelift Toronto!"

Five Strains of Medical Marijuana and Its Effects on the Mind and Body,2133,"The terms “getting stoned,” “getting drunk,” and “getting baked” are all slang for the same thing. Marijuana has the power to both calm and cloud the mind, depending on how it is used. Weed can also help calm the body and relieve discomfort, but it can seriously affect motor functions if used inappropriately.

Choosing Vaping Over Cigarette This 2021,3078,"When you vape, you’re using an electronic cigarette, also known as an e-cigarette or e-cig. But, first and foremost, what is an electronic cigarette? It’s not a high-tech version of a tobacco cigarette, as many people believe. E-cigarettes emit vapor from the liquid inside, which may contain nicotine if desired. If you’re trying to stop smoking, it’s a smart way to get away from conventional cigarettes because it’s a healthier, smoke-free way to deliver nicotine. Is vaping healthier than smoking? One of the most significant and widely discussed advantages of vaping is that it is healthier than smoking. There have been several reports as well as first-hand accounts of people who feel better after switching from smoking to vaping. And another amazing thing is you can buy over 1000 different vape juices. “Many who stopped smoking and moved to vaping saw their blood vessel function increase by around 1.5 percentage points in four weeks compared to those who continued to smoke,” according to many Scientist articles. According to the same report, every 1% improvement in vascular health decreases the risk of cardiovascular events by 13%. Furthermore, though you may have recently heard some negative views on vaping in the press, Public Health England has stated that vaping is still 95 percent less harmful than smoking. If your wellbeing is a priority for you, and you’re ready to stop smoking, vaping might be the most effective way to gradually wean yourself and your body away from conventional tobacco cigarettes. Vaping is a low-cost option. When you turn from tobacco products to vaping, you should notice a significant reduction for money you spend on a daily basis. Traditional tobacco products are costly, in part because they are heavily taxed, so if you are a heavy smoker, the expense will quickly add up and become a financial burden. Although electronic vaping requires a slightly higher initial investment due to the need to purchase vape pens and other accessories, these initial investments will last a long time if you buy high-quality products and maintain them properly. As opposed to the cost of heavily smoking cigarettes, the continuing cost of these things would comfortably be less than half. Vaping does not have a harmful odor The scent is one of the most powerful deterrents to using tobacco products. When you smoke a lot of cigarettes on a regular basis, it’s difficult not to smell like an ashtray. Since tobacco smoke has a strong odor that lingers, it can be bothersome not only to you but also to those who aren’t smokers. Since you inhale vapor rather than smoke when you vape, you can avoid the odor of a cigarette when you turn to vaping. When vaping, you can emit a light scent of the E Liquid you’re using, but it’s not as strong or unpleasant as cigarette smoke, and it doesn’t linger. When you turn to vaping, you will get rid of the smell and be certain that your non-smokers can appreciate it. E Liquid is available online Over 100 e liquid flavors to choose from and Delicious e liquids to buy online, win–*win situation."

Exploring Hunger Control with Melanotan-2 Melanotan-2, or MT-2, is a synthetic peptide that was developed by researchers at the University of Arizona in the 1980s. In tests done on rodents, there was good evidence to suggest that MT-2 reduced fat storage and hunger behavior. In the rats that were given MT-2, there was a marked reduction in how much food they ate and it changed their preference for fatty foods. MT2 accomplishes this by regulating food cravings similar to the way the hormone leptin does. Leptin is often called the satiety hormone because it gives a feeling of fullness and interrupts what could be destructive cravings. Melanotan 2 is not yet approved by the FDA. Although this peptide requires more research, it has many different future possibilities for medical use. Carry a Healthy Emergency Stash It’s a good idea to carry a stash of healthy snacks you can turn to when you get hungry.

Erotic Massage Secrets You Need To Try,3221,"Sensual massage is a great way to excite a partner, show him care, and surprise him with the sweetness of relaxation after a hard day. Besides, a good erotic massage is a great way to diversify intimate life. Before starting the intimate caressing, it is very important to take care of several things that will make the evening unforgettable. So, let’s have a detailed look at the secrets of a good erotic massage. Those are: The most important thing in the process is the atmosphere! Therefore, preparation is an essential part of the procedure. For massage, a bed is great if it is large and has a good mattress. A floor covered with a soft coat will also do. The main condition is that the man should be comfortable and cozy in the room. Mute the light in the room, light scented candles, turn on relaxing music in the background – all this will additionally affect the relaxation of the partner. Massage oil is also a very important item. But to use it properly you should know how to do it. The first rule is that the more oil is used – the better. Secondly, if the massage includes a happy ending, special intimate massage oil is used (if you want to give the erotic massage by yourself, you can easily buy it in any sex shop). In addition, specialized massage oils in most cases have a pleasant smell, so organs of smell will enjoy the procedure too, which will bring additional pleasant sensations. The feet are one of the most erogenic zones on the human body, a large number of nerve endings are concentrated there. In addition, foot massage itself is a rather rare kind of caressing, and therefore very intimate. So, a great thing is to start the erotic massage session with it. Having massaged feet, an experienced masseuse will move to the back. Shoulders, back, and lower back are most stressed during the day, so caressing these areas is extremely important. It’s better to start with gentle strokes along the back, from the neck to the coccyx. When massaging the neck, it is better to limit yourself to ordinary strokes, but the shoulders and lower back can be massaged more intensively. Special attention should be paid to the lower back. There are many nerve endings located there, the stimulation of which promotes active circulation in the pelvic organs, which is important for erection. Body to body massage is a nice ending to ordinary massage. As a rule, after such a tender caressing, the man is very aroused and ready for erotic continuation. When a man is already quite excited, it is very important to catch this moment, because sexual arousal may go down if the penis and testicles are not stimulated. At the moment when the masseuse realizes that the man is at the peak of excitement, the final phase of massage begins. An experienced masseuse can make a man experience an orgasm in minutes, but she’ll never do it. Long-lasting sweet torturing is much better, right? So, at the final stage of the massage, the girl uses either her hands or her body parts (or both) to stimulate the man’s penis, testicles, and prostate (if a man desires it). In SweetTouch Paris, you can experience all these massage secrets. With incredibly beautiful SweetTouch girls, this experience will be one of a kind."

What You Need To Know About Telemedicine In Health Insurance,3176,"Even as 2020 is almost drawing to a close, the COVID 19 pandemic is not yet showing any signs of abating. With social distancing measures still being enforced, it is wise to go out only when really necessary. In fact, hospitals and clinics now encourage patients to turn to telemedicine services for instant access to medical care. And in order to support this initiative, the IRDAI has now instructed insurers to include coverage for telemedicine in health insurance policies where OPD is covered. So, what is telemedicine? Telemedicine refers to the use of digital or electronic platforms for healthcare service, in situations where the doctor and their patient cannot meet in person. One of the most common ways of accessing telemedicine is through video consultations with the doctor. They can offer a professional diagnosis in real time and only ask you to come in for a face-to-face meeting if absolutely necessary (if you need any additional tests). The importance of telemedicine during COVID 19 At present, it is not advisable to simply walk into a hospital or clinic for a diagnosis. If you are COVID 19 positive, you may infect others; if you aren’t, you may pick up an infection. Telemedicine is helping make healthcare services accessible to everyone from the safety of their homes. It is also preventing hospitals and medical centres from getting overcrowded with walk-in patients. People can reach out to their doctors via online consultation and only head over for tests, if required. Moreover, telemedicine is also helping keep vulnerable sections of the population safe from infection. For instance, pregnant women can avoid stepping out for their regular check-ups and instead connect with their doctor online. The inclusion of telemedicine in health insurance As per recent instructions from the IRDAI, insurers covering medical consultations in their health insurance policies must also include telemedicine charges too for coverage.  So, if OPD forms a part of your health insurance, telemedicine charges would get covered under this section. Do keep in mind that telemedicine charges too would be subject to the normal sub-limits set by the insurer for medical consultation coverage in your health insurance policy. Any charges incurred by the policyholder for telemedicine can be filed as per the normal claims process set by the insurer. This new directive set by the IRDAI widens the scope of OPD coverage in health insurance.

How to Heal an Injury Faster,5861,"The way you treat an injury will often determine how long it lingers. Done correctly, treatment of a sprained ankle, for example, can hasten the healing process and get you back to walking and running in no time. If, however, you continue to put stress on an injured ankle or any other body part, you risk reinjuring yourself and making your body work harder to rehabilitate the injury. When you are hurt, you need to pay attention to signs your body is giving you. There are things to look for that will tell you if you are ready to start moving again, exercising, go back to work, or take on any number of other functions. For serious injuries like bone breaks, head injuries, surgeries, etc., you should seek professional medical advice on when you can start getting back to normal. There are things you can do to heal an injury faster and boost your body’s ability to recover. No one wants to suffer from injury any longer than necessary. Bad injuries can linger for weeks, months, and even years if the proper healing and recovery protocols are not followed. Here are ways you can heal an injury faster and get back in great shape sooner rather than later. Listen to Your Doctor The first thing you need to do, if your injury is serious, is to listen to your doctor. The people around you, like your friends and family, will likely have opinions about what is best for you and your injury. Don’t place their opinion over the opinion of trained experts. Listen to your doctor, nurse, physical therapist, and anyone else providing you care. When they say rest, rest. If they prescribe medicine, take it and follow the recommended doses. Doctors know that a comprehensive approach is the best way to heal an injury faster. They will likely tell you to do things like physical therapy, to make changes in your diet, get more sleep, and other things in addition to getting direct medical care. Integrate as much of their advice into your life as you can to hasten the healing process. Get Plenty of Rest Rest is an equal partner to recovery. Not only should you isolate any injured body part, but you should also get enough sleep and avoid exerting yourself to make energy available to heal. Get more sleep to lower inflammation. Change your activity level to allow your ankle, wrist, leg, or whatever is injured some much-needed downtime. If you fail to rest, not only are you robbing your injury of crucial recovery time, but you’re also likely stressing the injury or risking additional injuries as other parts of your body compensate. If, for instance, your shoulder is injured, you may end up placing more weight on your other shoulder, which increases the risk of injury to the shoulder, your back, and even your legs. Eat Nutrient-Rich Foods The food you eat is the fuel your body will use to heal an injury. If you’re constantly eating junk foods like candy, bad carbs, and other snacks, your body has to work harder to break them down. When you eat healthy foods like vegetables, meats, healthy fats, and foods high in protein, you supercharge your body’s ability to heal. These types of foods also have a rich supply of vitamins that boost your immune system, optimize blood flow, and promote blood vessel growth. You’ll feel better and your body will get better faster. Supplement Your Diet with Vitamin Supplements Eating the right foods and getting your diet in order is a great first step to protecting your body and giving it the resources, it needs to heal. You can, however, turbocharge your healing by taking supplements that will add to your total vitamin count and make more vitamins bioavailable for your body to use. Things like Vitamin C and Vitamin E promote your immune response and reduce inflammation. Vitamin K can help push more oxygen into your blood and increase hemoglobin. Many supplements promote healing available online at affordable costs. Peptides and Healing Researchers are giving more time and resources to exploring how peptides may promote the healing process. One peptide in particular, BPC-157 from www.peptidesciences.com, is a derivative of body protection compound, or BPC. BPC is a protein found in the human digestive tract that protects the gastrointestinal lining from any damage. It also encourages blood vessel growth. In clinical tests done on rodents, BPC-157 showed positive results when it came to the coagulation process, immune system function, blood vessel growth, and other aspects of wound healing. The research is giving new insight into wider applications that can help injuries heal faster. Mind the Mental as well as the Physical While your top concerns should be getting the right treatment and recovery plan, there are also things you can do mentally to help your body heal. One of the biggest health detractors is modern-day stress. Things like financial worries, family confrontations, long commutes, work stress, and other stressors can hurt your physical health. They raise your blood pressure and cause inflammation. If you want to gain an edge on healing faster, removing outside sources of stress is a great choice. Do your best to foster a peaceful, wholesome environment without too many outside stimulants to distract your mind and body. Dealing with an injury requires a comprehensive approach. Yes, most injuries eventually heal, but how long they take to heal will depend on the steps you take to administer self-care. Work with your medical support system on a plan that fits your lifestyle and needs. Not everyone can stay at home or go to physical therapy sessions every day of the week. Do your best to create a plan that fits your life and do your best to promote a healthy lifestyle. You’ll be back to normal before you know it and with full recovery, you can keep working to make your body stronger than ever. Staying healthy is, after all, the best way to prevent injury."

Aid group says WHO is restricting access to Ebola vaccines in Congo,2507,"A rigid system of eligibility set by the World Health Organization means far too few people at risk of Ebola are being vaccinated in an outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo, the aid group MSF said on Monday. The medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) said its efforts to get more people to be given the vaccine – developed by the U.S. drugmaker Merck (MRK.N) and being used in emergency plans in the Congo epidemic – were being frustrated by “tight controls on supply and eligibility criteria imposed by the WHO”. “Time is of essence in an outbreak: medical teams should be able to rapidly provide treatments or vaccines based on what they see on the ground,” MSF’s emergency coordinator Natalie Roberts said in a statement. “But our capacity… is severely undermined by a rigid system which is hard to comprehend.” The WHO denied it was rationing the vaccine and said it was working as hard as any organization to end Congo’s deadly Ebola outbreak. “We partner closely with the DRC government to reach as many communities and individuals in the outbreak area as possible and are not limiting access to vaccine,” it said. The Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year, second only to the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The WHO and the Congolese health ministry say that since August 2018, more than 223,000 people have been vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV, the Merck vaccine that has been shown in clinical trials to be highly protective against Ebola infection. Congo health authorities also gave the go-ahead on Saturday for plans to introduce a second Ebola vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), to help fight the outbreak. The Merck shot is being deployed in a strategy known as “ring vaccination”, which aims to control Ebola by identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts of those likely to be infected. The WHO said that because Ebola spreads via person-to-person contact, this is “the most effective means of stopping” its spread, but MSF’s Roberts likened the situation to “giving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day”. The WHO said the Merck vaccine eligibility and strategy were recommended by independent specialists in agreement with Congo. The plan with addition of the J&J vaccine, it said, is to extend protection by providing it to “targeted at-risk populations” in areas where the disease is not yet being actively transmitted."
A common numbing medication turned a woman’s blood blue,1359,"In Rhode Island, a 25-year-old woman gave a new meaning to the phrase ‘feeling blue’. She developed a rare and sometimes incurable condition called methemoglobinemia that turned her blood a shade of navy blue. The case was described on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and told the doctors that for a toothache she had used a topical pain reliever. The morning she woke up feeling sick and went to the emergency room.  As per Dr. Otis Warren, an ER physician at Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island, she told emergency room doctors, ‘I am weak and I am blue.’ The initial reading showed that her blood oxygen level was 88% that is lower than the normal, although higher than what doctors estimated given her appearance. Dr. Otis Warren immediately recognized the problem that it is methemoglobinemia. He told, ‘The skin color looked just the same.’ ‘You see it one time, and it stays in your mind.’ Methemoglobinemia happens when the iron in a blood changes form and, as a consequence, can no longer bind to oxygen and carry it throughout the body.  In the case of a woman, she hadn’t taken an antibiotic. She had used an over-the-counter anesthetizing medication, which contained benzocaine, to reduce the tooth pain. She told to Dr. Warren that she didn’t use the entire bottle, but it was clear to him that she had ‘used a complete lot of it.’  "
Texas girl contracts brain-eating amoeba during swim in river,1022,"A young Texas girl is fighting for her life after she was infected with a deadly brain-eating amoeba following a day spent swimming in a river, according to reports. Lily Mae Avant, 10, went swimming over Labor Day weekend in the Brazos River near Waco — where doctors believe she contracted the often-fatal Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Days after her swim, the Valley Mills Elementary School student started experiencing a fever and a headache, according to the station. Though she appeared to be suffering from symptoms of a common virus, her family said they still believed that “something was not quite right,” according to a Facebook page launched to support Lily. Then one night, Lily’s mother heard concerning noises coming from her daughter’s room. “She was incoherent, unresponsive and was quickly swept up and taken to the ER,” the page said. Lily was then flown to Cook Children’s Heath Care System in Forth Worth, where a spinal tap revealed she had contracted Naegleriasis, a rare infection caused by the amoeba."
10-year-old Texas girl contracts brain-eating amoeba while swimming,1599,"A weekend swim left a young girl fighting for her life when she contracted a brain-eating amoeba with a 97% fatality rate. The 10-year-old girl swam in the Brazos River and Lake Whitney in Bosque County near Waco over Labor Day weekend, according to a report. Then, on September 8, the girl “began having a headache, and it was quickly followed by a fever,” according to a Facebook page created to support the girl. Her family thought it was a viral infection at first, but after visits to the family doctor and the girl having trouble sleeping, the family knew something was wrong. “She was incoherent, unresponsive and was quickly swept up and taken to the ER,” the family wrote on the girl’s Facebook page. The girl was then flown to Cook Children’s Health Care System in Fort Worth where a spinal tap found she had contracted Naegleria fowleri. “It’s every parent’s worst nightmare,” the girl’s aunt, Crystal Warren, told Friday. “For this to happen to her when there were so many other people in the same waters on the same days we just don’t understand why it was her.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the amoeba is a single-cell living organism commonly found in warm freshwater like lakes and rivers. The amoeba enters the body through the nose, travels to the brain and destroys brain tissue, according to the CDC. Between 2009 and 2018, the CDC says only 34 cases of the Naegleria fowleri infection were reported in the US. Only four people out of the 145 known cases survived between 1962 and 2018.

Health officials on Thursday said 380 confirmed cases and probable cases have been reported in 36 states and one U.S. territory. That marks a decrease from the 450 cited last week, when officials were also including “possible” cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state officials have been investigating an outbreak that began materializing in the Midwest in July. Doctors say the illnesses seemsto be an inhalation injury, with the body apparently reacting to a caustic substance that someone breathed in. Symptoms have included shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Many young and previously healthy adolescents and young adults required machines to help them breathe. Six deaths have been reported, all adults and at least some with pre-existing lung problems or other conditions that may have made them more prone. The illnesses are seen as a new phenomenon, and it’s taken weeks for CDC officials to come up with a case definition and for states to start following it. Thursday’s tally from the CDC was the first based on the new case definition, which counts only breathing illnesses with abnormal chest X-rays, a recent history of vaping, and lab work done to rule out infectious diseases or other possible causes. No single device, liquid or ingredient has been identified as the cause, and health officials are advising people not to vape at all until more is known. The states reporting vaping-related lung illnesses to the CDC are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia — plus the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some other states have announced they are investigating possible vaping illnesses, but have not yet told CDC that those illnesses met case definitions for confirmed or probable cases, CDC officials said. The deaths, previously reported, were in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota and Oregon."
Questions surround cause of vaping-related illnesses as local man hospitalized,2859,"As the federal government proposes a crackdown on vaping, local hospitals are now seeing cases of vaping-related illnesses. President Donald Trump announced a new enforcement proposal Tuesday that would require e-cigarette companies to take their flavored products off the market. This comes amid a reported outbreak of mysterious respiratory illnesses across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted at least 450 cases in 33 states, including six deaths, which are all linked to e-cigarettes. One of those cases involves a local man who just spent more than a week in the Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital. “He came in with some shortness of breath,” said Dr. Shawn Varney, an emergency room doctor at University Hospital and professor of Emergency Medicine at UT Health San Antonio. “And during the course of his hospital stay, he deteriorated.” After originally showing up with flu-like symptoms, the young man started breathing more rapidly and complained of a lack of oxygen, said Dr. Varney. “Over a short period, he wound up needing to have assistance on breathing. He had to have a breathing tube and was put on a ventilator.” As a medical toxicologist and director of the South Texas Poison Center, Dr. Varney had a hunch about what may have been contributing to his illness. He thought it might be connected to vaping. “But by the time we were considering this as a diagnosis, we had already intubated him, so we couldn’t ask him,” he said. “We had to wait until after he recovered over that week and had the breathing tube removed,” and that’s when he said the patient confirmed it. “We had a come-to-Jesus talk. We said, ‘This is what we’re seeing. What are you doing?’ And he went, ‘Ok, yeah. I use all the time.'” Dr. Varney said the patient also fit the same demographic as the majority of the other people coming down with these vaping-related illnesses. “These are young kids in their 20’s, no medical problems, absolutely no reason to come down with such a severe disease.” The cause of the recent nationwide outbreak remains a mystery, but officials have said most were vaping THC – the source of marijuana’s high – or a combination of nicotine and THC. “We suspect that a good source would be coming from the streets,” said Dr. Varney. “Specifically marijuana. THC. People obtain the product and then they put it in their own chambers so they can vape.” “Off the street, unregulated THC cartridges,” said Brandon Berube, general manager of Hazel Sky Smoke Shop off Fredericksburg Road. “I pray there is more clarification in the future.” Clarification about the difference between store-bought cartridges and modified street-bought e-cigs. “Store-bought is fully regulated. You’re going to get a good clean product,” he said. “With street-bought, you’re getting stuff people made in their bath tub.”"
