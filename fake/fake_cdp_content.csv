"DHS Announces ‘Returning’ Illegal Criminals Must Have Taxpayer Funded Homes, Healthcare, Legal Assistance",23 JUL 2021,6825,"The U.S. taxpayer will shortly be paying for housing, healthcare, legal assistance, and other socialist programs for returning illegal alien criminals. Breitbart News explained: Many of the deported migrants who are now getting special invites to re-enter the U.S. are so poor they need government aid for housing and healthcare, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The admission came in a July 19 statement to progressive contractors who want to be paid for wrapping the poor and unskilled migrants in the taxpayer-funded federal welfare system. The DHS statement said: When appropriate, the Contractor shall collaborate with other providers, contractors, and stakeholders to help ensure a “wraparound” approach to services. Services include but are not limited to: housing, primary health care, nutrition assistance, legal assistance, immigration and travel processes. The housing aid is being offered to lawfully deported migrants who are being invited to return by Joe Biden’s pro-migration deputies. Progressives argue the aid is deserved because the migrants were unfairly separated from their children during the deportation process. Yet any housing given to migrants will raise Americans’ rents,  including the rents paid by the poor and minority Americans whom progressives claim to support. The potential winners in any welfare wraparound contract include the university-trained progressives in the various pro-migration advocacy groups. These progressives work with groups such as the ACLU and large pro-migration groups such as Kids In Need of Defense (KIND), which was created by Brad Smith, Microsoft’s very wealthy pro-migration president. The progressives serve as cheerleaders and enablers for investors who want the government to extract poor consumers, renters, and workers from other countries for use in the U.S. economy. The progressives embrace their supportive role, even though the inflow gradually pushes many millions of ordinary Americans out of decent jobs and good housing. On July 21, Axios.com allowed the progressives to make their pitch for a wraparound contract: At least a third of migrant families separated at the border during the Trump administration and reunited in the U.S. so far under President Biden were homeless initially, three people familiar with estimates discussed by advocates and government officials told Axios. Why it matters: As the number of reunions grows, such homelessness rates have the potential to significantly strain non-governmental organizations already plagued by limited resources. Some 41 family reunifications have been completed on Biden’s watch. With an estimated 2,100 families still separated, that’s too small a sample to gauge with certainty the extent of the housing needs moving forward. “Parents are coming back with very little to no resources and coming back to very precarious situations,” said Christie Turner-Herbas, KIND’s director of special programs. The Axios report also included a warning to Biden’s deputies: “‘It should be in the Biden administration’s interest not to see these families … end up in homeless shelters,’ Lee Gelernt, the ACLU’s lead attorney in its family separation lawsuit, told Axios.” Perhaps 2,000 of the deported migrants are being invited back in by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who has a limited “parole” authority to admit people “for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” “Our highest priority is to reunite these families … It’s not about righting the wrong of the past, it’s about restoring the conscience of our government,” Mayorkas said as he touted his return of four deported migrants in a May 4 appearance on MSNBC. The adult migrants were temporarily separated from their children as the adults were processed in the criminal courts while the children were sheltered in other centers. Some of the parents were sent home without their children — and some choose to separate themselves from their children by leaving them behind in the United States so the children could apply for asylum. Investors and progressives stigmatized this law enforcement as “family separation,” and “zero tolerance,” as they opposed almost any effort to curb the flow of consumers, renters, and migrants across the border. The pro-enforcement policy began in July 2017 and lasted until January 2021, when it was quickly ended by Biden’s pro-migration administration. Biden’s deputies say the policy separated at perhaps 4,000 children from the parents amid the vast inflow of 2 million migrants. But Trump largely ended the migration inflow from mid-2019 once his deputies pushed out a series of reforms that were fought in court by the ACLU and other investor-funded lawyer groups. Trump’s reduction in migration help nudge up salaries for Americans for forcing employers to compete for American workers in a tight labor market. In general, legal and illegal migration moves wealth from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to investors, from technology to stoop labor. Biden’s revived federal delivery of legal and illegal labor also helps to move wealth — and social status — from heartland red states to the coastal blue states and from the rural districts to the urban districts within each state. Obviously, investors want to import more migrants — even very poor migrants — because they spike sales, rental rates, profits, and stock values. The DHS statement promises that aid to the migrants — dubbed “class members” — will be free of any obligations or costs: Terms of establishing contact for pre-reunification and post-reunification include:
Informing the class member that all of the services being offered are voluntary and they shall not be penalized in any way for rejecting them. Informing the class member that this effort is NOT for DHS, HHS or any government entity to track them, but rather to aid in their recovery from traumatic separation. Informing the class member that engaging in these support or mental health services, or even reaching out for more information shall not affect any efforts they may have been making towards obtaining legal status, their housing, any current or future social services, any work they may be engaged in for their livelihood (whether authorized or unauthorized) and their right to obtain a work permit when authorized. In June, Mayorkas said he will put the dignity of foreign migrants “foremost in our efforts.” For example, he ended the Trump administration’s “Public Charge” barring the award of green cards to migrants who would rely on taxpayer aid. “I felt, and we collectively in the Department felt, that the rescission of that rule would not only restore dignity to the process, but adhere to the rule of law,” he claimed."
"Health Department Intimidates Mother, Threatens to “Send Sheriff” In Contact Trace Gestapo Brigade",14 JUL 2021,12762,"In a scary story, one mom was threatened with a “sheriff” visit for questioning illegal ‘contact tracing.’ Undercover DC reported: In my home of Rochester, New York, there have been fairly regular attempts to de-platform non-liberal broadcasters. It’s remarkable really how many personalities I’ve come to know, appreciate, and anticipate as part of the local media landscape who have disappeared overnight for a shock-jock take of theirs on race relations, or even in one case a mispronunciation that could be misconstrued as having been about race. Possibly the only regional anti-establishment personality currently remaining on terrestrial radio in Rochester is the anti-vax pit bull, Shannon Joy. I did an interview with Shannon Joy for UncoverDC a few months ago. A unique thing about Shannon Joy among local broadcasters who have been a target of harassment, as Joy has recently, is that she wasn’t made a mark due to a comment of hers about race. Unique too was that an attack didn’t come with a demand that her employment be terminated. When Joy had a press conference last week on the steps of the Monroe County Government Building to announce a lawsuit, I contacted her to see about a second interview to ask about the new development. She explained to me that the issue the lawsuit is meant to address began with phone calls to her from contact tracers. She had avoided their calls as a matter of principle, as many people probably have, if not on principle, then likely some who like me are lousy about checking the answering machine or picking up the phone. Joy’s case, anyway, was escalated because she’d avoided the calls. Eventually, Joy, after receiving seven phone calls in two days, informed the county in what turned out to be the final call in the dispute that she didn’t think her family would need to quarantine. Joy began to record the conversation when she was vaguely threatened by the upper-level contact tracer on the phone. Joy recalled for me in our interview the situation as it stood at that point, “The county was harassing me the week before, with phone calls and questions, and so I informed them at the very last phone call I had with a senior-level contract tracer who reported directly to Mike Mendoza (Commissioner of Public Health for Monroe County) and basically told her my daughter wasn’t at the practice, at the place that you have identified as my daughter being, she wasn’t there, and we have witnesses. We have proof.” Joy had been contacted about her daughter having been at a volleyball practice where someone unnamed had the virus, but Joy’s daughter had not attended that practice. The final phone call could have been the end of the matter, but this is where we enter the logic of western novels. In a western novel, if you’re new in town and get on the wrong side of the dude running things, he sends some men out to your ranch to have a talk with you and yours. The conversation on the phone between Joy and the contact tracer had its provocative moments, and Joy played full audio of the call on an episode of her radio show. Lawyer and fellow anti-vaxxer Chad Hummel was a guest on that episode and chimed in during a replay of the call with opinions on various things said by the contact tracer. To give you a taste for the call, here’s a pertinent section: Joy: … because you said just a few minutes ago, you said that you could send the sheriff to my house – Contact tracer: I could. Joy: — so what did you mean by that? So, what does the sheriff do when he comes to my house? Contact tracer: They could fine you or your daughter. You could be fined. Joy: Why would the sheriff need to come to my house to fine me? Contact tracer: You know, honestly, I don’t know the details of how that happens. Joy: So, I’m just concerned that if Mike Mendoza—You’re telling people that if they don’t comply with quarantine—because you just told me if I didn’t comply, you would send a sheriff to my house — Contact tracer: I did not say that. Joy: That’s exactly what you said. Contact tracer: I said we could. During playback of the call, Hummel weighed in with his opinion on the contact tracer’s contention that Joy’s daughter would have to be quarantined but while offering no proof Joy’s daughter had been in contact with anyone positive for Covid: “You can’t claim to be doing something legally that is essentially illegal by just simply moving it under a different umbrella. So, if the state has to follow due process laws when it’s a police officer with a gun and a badge, you can’t simply say, ‘OK, in order to get around affording somebody due process, we’re going to turn this matter over to the health department and let them do it because the health department doesn’t have to follow due process.’” So we have a health department circumventing due process? A consistent problem with any conspiracy involving “the elite” manipulating reality for their own nefarious purposes is that there’s rarely a villain’s face to attach to the devilish scheme. There’s never any mad doctor at the center of things de-winging horseflies for his own twisted enjoyment. This story is a little different in that there actually is a mad doctor. Dr. Mendoza, our Commissioner of Public Health, like Fauci, like Cuomo, was made a star by Covid. That elevated status came with a certain amount of reluctance on Mendoza’s part to behave. As covered in two previous articles of mine for UncoverDC, various advocates against Covid restrictions in Monroe County, such as Shannon Joy, noticed a deliberate time-wasting game played among the entities capable of lifting the restrictions. Joy explained in our interview the delayed re-opening of local schools, “It is a circular finger-pointing squad. So, Mike Mendoza says it’s up to the state. He says his hands are tied because of the state guidelines. The state throws it back on the (school) superintendents saying they’re free to open if they want to open, take the masks off. The superintendents fling it back to Mike Mendoza and say, our hands are tied, the county wants us to do this, and then we go back to Mendoza, and it’s around and around and around. It’s purposeful. That’s the strategy.” So that’s part of what our local mad doctor has been up to. A wide-reaching game meant to stall for time. There may be debate as to what the endgame would be to delay schools’ fully re-opening. The general sense I have is that the delayed re-opening was most likely meant to encourage vaccination. After Joy described the circular finger-pointing squad during our interview, I chimed in, “Because they want everyone to get the vaccine, correct?” She surprised me when she said,  “Eventually, yes. They just do what they’re told. They don’t know what they want.” I asked who then was the man behind the curtain in the grand scheme to have everyone vaccinated? Joy answered: “It’s the pharmaceutical companies who pay Mendoza. So, the pharmaceutical companies. Big pharma. They are just shoving an enormous amount of money at media. They own media outlets. If you watch any media, every other commercial is for a pharmaceutical product, and they’re also giving them money as well. They own social media. They spread billions of dollars into politicians’ pockets. Mike Mendoza’s job is to get as many people vaccinated as possible. That’s his job. Because the pharmaceutical companies own the politicians, and the politicians hire people who do the bidding of the pharmaceutical companies. It’s trillions of dollars on the line.” To compress the subject a bit and get back to my strengths—which involve keeping a story manageable—let’s get back to what was going on with Joy and the contract tracer. I’ll leave it to some other writer to land a solid blow to big pharma. As I understand it, having listened to the audio of the phone call, the basic argument was that the contract tracer was not satisfied that Joy’s daughter hadn’t been exposed to Covid even though Joy contended that her daughter had not been present at the Saturday event in question. The contact tracer, as best I could make out in a conversation with overlapping voices, said that “What you told me is that she wasn’t at practice on Saturday but that she was either at a practice or game earlier in that week on Thursday or Friday.” Joy countered with, “Yes, however, she was not within six feet of anyone who had Covid, and unless you can prove to me that she was, then this order of quarantine is not enforceable.” However, the contact tracer’s mind could not be changed about the necessity for Joy’s daughter to quarantine. This leads us to another opinion offered by Hummel: “What we’re talking about here is a judge and police officer—Dr. Mike Mendoza’s acting as if he’s the judge signing warrants, and then they’re using people like her to make the phone calls. If you commit a crime and the police are investigating it, they may call your phone. And somebody may be on the other end of your phone and identify themselves as deputy so-and-so from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Department, and you would take that call seriously because they’re the police and that police officer would never issue you an order or never come in your home unless they had due process. If the police officer can’t do it, how in the hell can nurse practitioner whatever—Linda Mack-Fogg (contact tracer), Dr. Mike Mendoza’s minion— how can she do it?” Joy likely imagined she was in good standing at the time of the radio broadcast in which she replayed the call and received reassurances from Hummel. The next day, however, things would change mightily. Joy wasn’t home when visitors came to her door, which again seems appropriate to western novels. The protagonist is rarely at home with their family when the welcoming committee shows up. Joy recalled for me the incident involving her 12-year-old daughter and her 9-year-old son, “On April 3rd, the day before Easter, my daughter was downstairs watching cartoons when she saw a strange man came up on the porch aggressively banging on the door. She didn’t know who he was. She looked out the window and saw two police officers on the sidewalk, armed, and another stranger, so when she didn’t answer the door, they went around to our side door. So, around our porch to our side door, and started banging on the side door. My son Teddy was there playing video games. It scared him too. So, she ran upstairs and got my husband. I was driving my son to volleyball practice at the time, so I wasn’t even there, and she ran upstairs, got her dad, said, there’s a stranger, I’m scared. My husband gets dressed, comes downstairs, and is met with two health inspectors—two contact tracers from the county and two police officers. They were there to deliver my daughter, my 12-year-old daughter, a quarantine order.” I wondered how usual this sort of thing was, on how regular a basis, Mendoza pulls this sort of thing. After Joy told me that Mendoza and the County Health Department never send contact tracers to a home to deliver a quarantine order, I asked if she was the only person this had ever happened to. Her answer: “I’m the only one. And they’ve never sent police. Ever. And Mendoza justified they did it because they thought that the contact tracer would be in danger from me. From a 12-year-old girl to deliver an order to a 12-year-old girl. They thought that the police presence was justified because it was me, indicating they knew it was me. They knew who I was. I never had a record of violence. I don’t even have a parking ticket.” About par for the course in a lawless town. Joy said of the forthcoming lawsuits: “We are suing the County of Monroe, we’re suing the Monroe County Health Department, Mike Mendoza personally, and also the Fairport Police Department, and it’s on two matters. First, we are challenging—it’s a civil rights lawsuit that we hope to take all the way up if we can. So through federal court and even to supreme court to challenge the constitutionality of quarantine orders on due process. So essentially, you cannot willy-nilly declare permanent emergency and just order people into home confinement which is equivalent of prison without some kind of due process, without proving that this is necessary, that there is a health emergency, that this person is sick and a threat to other people in society.” “We’re also filing a suit for damages against the County Health Department and Mike Mendoza for harassment, for harassing my family, for trying to intimidate us, me a member of the press, which also loops in first amendment rights as well. And so that’s the nature of the lawsuit, and we filed a notice of claim to all of those entities: Fairport Police Department, Monroe County, Monroe County Department of Health, Mike Mendoza.”"
1 in 3 Americans Say Government Health Officials Lying About Vaccine Safety,8 JUL 2021,2205,"At least one in three Americans don’t believe the lies about vaccine safety. The National Pulse reported: According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, 32 percent of American adults think that “public health officials are lying about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.” Forty-eight percent said public health officials are not lying and 20 percent are not sure. While only 21 percent of vaccinated Americans believe public health officials are lying, 50 percent of those who are unvaccinated and 63 percent of those who said they do not plan to get the Covid vaccine at all believe public health officials are being dishonest. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they were vaccinated while 32 percent said they were not. Of the unvaccinated, a majority of 54 percent stated that they did not intend to get the Covid vaccine in the future. Twenty-three percent of Democrats, 44 percent of Republicans, and 32 percent of unaffiliated respondents said that they believe public health officials are lying about the safety of the vaccine. This means that Republicans are almost twice as likely to believe in public health officials’ dishonesty on the vaccine as Democrats. “More Democrats (77%) than Republicans (55%) or unaffiliateds (56%) have already got vaccinated against COVID-19. Among those who haven’t gotten a coronavirus vaccination yet, 64% of Republicans, 38% of Democrats and 53% of the unaffiliated don’t plan to get vaccinated in the future. The highest level of the unvaccinated who don’t plan to get a COVID-19 vaccination is 71% among women under age 40.” While married Americans are more likely to have been vaccinated than those who are unmarried, those who have children at home are more likely to think that public health officials are lying about the vaccine. Americans who make over $100,000 annually are more likely to have gotten the Covid vaccine than those with lower incomes. Americans with an annual salary of less than $30,000 are the most likely to disbelieve public health officials on the vaccine. Furthermore, “Entrepreneurs are more likely than government workers, private-sector employees or retirees to believe public health officials are lying about COVID-19 vaccine safety.”"
Video Shows Eco-Health President Boasting About “Killer” COVID Created By “Colleagues In China”,14 JUN 2021,2415,"Nothing like getting excited about a “killer” cold virus developed by “colleagues in China,” right? That’s exactly what a new video shows EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak saying. The National Pulse reported: EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak – who collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease – appears to boast about the manipulation of “killer” SARS-like coronaviruses carried out by his “colleagues in China” in a clip unearthed by The National Pulse. Daszak made the admission at a 2016 forum discussing “emerging infectious diseases and the next pandemic,” which appears to be at odds with Fauci’s repeated denial of funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. While describing how his organization sequences deadly viruses, Daszak describes the process of “insert[ing] spike proteins” into viruses to see if they can “bind to human cells” as being carried out by his “colleagues in China”: “Then when you get a sequence of a virus, and it looks like a relative of a known nasty pathogen, just like we did with SARS. We found other coronaviruses in bats, a whole host of them, some of them looked very similar to SARS. So we sequenced the spike protein: the protein that attaches to cells. Then we… Well I didn’t do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work. You create pseudo particles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses, see if they bind to human cells. At each step of this you move closer and closer to this virus could really become pathogenic in people. “You end up with a small number of viruses that really do look like killers,” he adds. The comments follow growing evidence that Fauci’s NIAID has deep financial and personnel ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology – and that Daszak’s EcoHealth alliance was one of the primary proxies funneling the money to the Chinese Communist Party lab. Over a dozen research papers carried out under a $3.7 million National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) grant list the Wuhan Lab’s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Director Shi Zhengli as a co-author alongside Daszak. Shi has included these Fauci-backed grants on her resume. The Wuhan lab has also listed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as one of its “partners,” secretly erasing the mention in March 2021."
"Full Global State Push: Spain, Greece Testing Health ‘Certificate’ for Travel",28 MAY 2021,1028,"Greece and Spain have agreed to test the EU’s ‘digital green certificate,’ which allows you to travel based on COVID status. Breaking the News reported: Greece and Spain expressed on Friday their readiness to test the European Union’s Digital Green Certificate, a quick response (QR) code that will show a traveler’s health status concerning COVID-19, before their wider launch in the rest of the bloc on July 1. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated at the presentation of the document that it is “very, very simple. Essentially, it includes all the information that a member-state would need to welcome a traveler without imposing additional restrictions.” At the same event, European Council President Charles Michel hailed the certificate as a “great European success.” On a separate occasion, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his country will also follow Greece’s example, saying that “this will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.”"
Biden Regime Just Stole $2 Billion In COVID ‘Healthcare’ To ‘Help’ Illegals,18 MAY 2021,8853,"The Biden regime just allocated (aka stole) $2 billion slated for Healthcare (under the COVID pork scam) to help illegal alien criminals. Breitbart News reported: President Joe Biden has taken $2 billion from Americans’ healthcare programs to help deliver migrant youths and children to their illegal-migrant parents throughout the United States, press reports say. “The Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] has diverted more than $2 billion meant for other health initiatives toward covering the cost of caring for unaccompanied immigrant children,” Politico reported May 15. The article continued: The redirected funds include $850 million that Congress originally allocated to rebuild the nation’s Strategic National Stockpile, the emergency medical reserve strained by the Covid-19 response. Another $850 million is being taken from a pot intended to help expand coronavirus testing, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. In addition to transferring money from the Strategic National Stockpile and Covid-19 testing, HHS also has pulled roughly $436 million from a range of existing health initiatives across the department. The program costs are expected to reach almost $9 billion by October according to a leaked report in the New York Times. The transfer of funding to the growing population of more than 50,000 foreign children and youths means fewer resources for lower-profile American kids, as their diverse American parents are damaged by the Chinese virus, cheap labor migration, job losses, housing costs, drugs, or homelessness. The Politico report follows the leak of a government report to the May 10 New York Times.  The leaked report showed how the HHS agency expects to spend almost $9 billion by October to implement Biden’s decision to import the youths and children of U.S.-based illegal migrants. “Current projections show [a] preliminary budget estimate of $8.6b for FY21,” said the briefing for officials in HHS. It continued: With existing resources, a shortfall (of 366m) occurs in May and grows quickly through July with an overall project shortfall in excess of $4 billion OMB approved an additional transfer from HHS resources to the UC [UAC] programing the amount of $850 million this week. This funding is not reflecting in this morning balance — will be added once [the] execution process is complete. There may be [an] additional $846.5 million available in future weeks. This will mitigate but not fully resolve the project budget shortfall. The HHS spending does not including spending — or diverted resources — at other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) and Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) are the top Republicans on the panels overseeing federal spending at HHS and the DHS. Their offices did not respond to emails from Breitbart News. Since January, roughly 50,000 youths and children have been accepted at the border by the government-run program, which replaced President Donald Trump’s policy of flying the youths and children back to their homes in Central America. Biden declined to use the judge-approved option of flying the arriving youths and children back to their distant homes. Strong majorities of swing voters blame Biden, not Trump, for the unpopular migration crisis. “The $2.13 billion in diverted money exceeds the government’s annual budget for the unaccompanied children program in each of the last two fiscal years,” Politico reported. But the overall migration is an economic stimulus for Biden’s business donors because the migrants inflate rents and stimulate federal, state, and local spending. Most of the 50,000 “children” are actually older teenage boys, many of whom will take jobs at low wages to repay their smuggling debts and support relatives in Central American countries. But even children are an economic stimulus for Biden’s business donors because they inflate rents and because they stimulate federal, state, and local spending, for example, on K-12 education programs. Biden’s delivery of the incoming youths and children also helps to keep their illegal migrant parents in the United States amid pressure from their distant families to return home.  For example, a New York Times May 6 report noted 51 percent of the UACs released in the prior week were handed over to parents or step-parents. Another 38 percent were handed over to immediate relatives, some of whom may have been fronting for nearby illegal migrant parents who declined to come forward. A May 13 tweet by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) cited federal data for 1029 that said 79 percent of sponsors were “without [legal] status.” The migration also creates a new generation of illegal migrants for business groups and progressive Democrats to champion instead of poor or disadvantaged Americans, just as Democrats now cheerlead for the “DACA” illegals. Biden’s policy is being implemented by Alejandro Mayorkas, a Cuban-born child refugee who runs the Department of Homeland Security. Mayorkas frequently claims the United States is a “Nation of Immigrants,” not of Americans. He frequently argues the nation’s values require Americans to accept many migrants, poor or rich, old or young, as if there is no economic or civic cost to Americans from the inflow of foreign migrants. The federal delivery of children to their illegal migrant parents, after their handoff at the border by cartel-controlled coyotes, has been an open secret in Washington, DC, for at least six years. The secret federal cooperation with the coyotes and the cartels stopped when President Donald Trump used his emergency authority in 2020 to send the migrants home when they arrived at the border.  The cooperation has been accelerated by President Biden as his deputies seek to extract more wage-cutting workers, taxpayer-supported consumers, and high-occupancy renters from Central American into the United States. “We’re complicit as a nation in human trafficking,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said at a March 26 press conference in Texas with 17 other GOP senators. Front Page Mag explained: Remember during the pandemic when we occasionally wondered where the supplies that the federal and state government was supposed to have stockpiled for emergencies like this were, and it turned out Obama and Democrat governors had emptied them out? Even lackluster RINOs like Schwarzenegger had responsibly built up stockpiles of supplies for an emergency that Democrats trashed. Once this became an issue, the media rushed into action, spinning frantically and tossing out denials. Except that we’re now seeing the same process repeating itself in real time. The Department of Health and Human Services has diverted more than $2 billion meant for other health initiatives toward covering the cost of caring for unaccompanied immigrant children (ed: illegal alien migrants of uncertain age), as the Biden administration grapples with a record influx of migrants on the southern border. The redirected funds include $850 million that Congress originally allocated to rebuild the nation’s Strategic National Stockpile, the emergency medical reserve strained by the Covid-19 response. Another $850 million is being taken from a pot intended to help expand coronavirus testing, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Hey, we’re past the pandemic. Let’s start redirecting the stockpiles and supplies to fund illegal aliens instead. And then next time this happens we can redirect more infected patients to nursing homes killing tens of thousands of seniors who are statistically more likely to vote Republican while promoting the illegal aliens who are more likely to vote Democrat. But by then the media will ghost edit its old articles mentioning this and insist that it never happened. But these transfers come as HHS has publicly sought to pump new funds into the Strategic National Stockpile and Covid-19 testing efforts by emphasizing the critical role that both play in the pandemic response and future preparedness efforts. They don’t care about prepping for a pandemic. They do care about illegal aliens. “The fight against Covid-19 is not yet over,” Becerra testified to a House panel on Wednesday in defense of a budget request that would allocate $905 million for the stockpile. “Even as HHS works to beat this pandemic, we are also preparing for the next public health crisis.” This is politics as usual. Clamor for money to fund something that people want and need, and then shift it over to your priorities like filling the country with illegal aliens. Becerra later stressed the need to “make sure we’ve got the resources” to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile It’s Becerra, by “national stockpile”, he meant the stockpile of illegal aliens that Democrats used to turn California blue and that they intend to use to take over Texas."
COVID Vax Deaths: Virologist Speaks Out On Blood Clots As Health Ambassador Dead In 48 Hours,13 MAY 2021,4000,"The danger of blood clot death from the COVID vaccine is much worse than the actual virus, and the evidence has been there since the beginning. One health ambassador who got the prick to show how safe it was, died within 48 hours. The Epoch Times explained: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed more cases of rare blood clots tied to the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, saying that more than two dozen cases have been reported. Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, with the CDC’s vaccine task force, said in an update (pdf) Wednesday that 28 total cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia were reported after the J&J vaccine was administered. Those were reported via the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is the national vaccine surveillance system. Shimabukuro said four of the 28 people with the condition were hospitalized—with one in a hospital intensive care unit—while three people died as of May 7. The other 19 patients have since been discharged, he said. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC on April 13 recommended states to temporarily halt using the J&J vaccine out of caution and investigated several women who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis along with low blood platelets within two weeks of getting the shot. But a CDC panel later in the month voted to resume usage of the single-shot vaccine and recommended adding a warning. Most of the cases were among women aged 18 to 49, the CDC said, with rates among women aged 30 to 39 at 12.4 cases per million and those aged 40 to 49 at 9.4 cases per million. Only six of the clotting events identified were in men. Women aged 40 to 49 had the “most pronounced” increase in cases of rare blood clotting, Shimabukuro said, according to Fox News. On Wednesday, the CDC said that the events appear similar to what is being observed following the administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. Both vaccines are based on technology that uses adenoviruses, which can cause the common cold, as vectors. The modified viruses are used to carry DNA instructions into the body to make specific coronavirus proteins, priming the immune system to make antibodies that fight off the actual coronavirus. Scientists are working to find the potential mechanism that would explain the blood clots. A leading hypothesis appears to be that the vaccines are triggering a rare immune response that could be related to these viral vectors. COVID-19 is the illness caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, also known as the novel coronavirus. The Epoch Times has contacted J&J for comment. Previously, the pharmaceutical giant told The Epoch Times, following reports of the clots, that the “safety and well-being of people who use our products” is the company’s priority. It noted that it’s aware of an “extremely rare disorder involving people with blood clots in combination with low platelets in a small number of individuals who have received our COVID-19 vaccine.” The Gateway Pundit reported: Indian Health Ambassador and former comedian Vivek got his COVID-19 vaccine live on TV in late April to show everyone how safe it is. The health ambassador died two days later. LifeSite News reported: Vivekh, an Indian actor and health ambassador for the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, died two days after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine dose earlier this month. The well-known actor and comedian was admitted to a local hospital on April 16 for cardiac arrest after being vaccinated with Covaxin, an Indian coronavirus vaccine, the day prior. The 59-year-old was brought to the hospital unconscious and underwent a coronary angiogram and angioplasty before his death the following morning, GreatGameIndia reported. The hospital said that Vivekh suffered acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock and 100% blockage of a blood vessel. The actor had taken his first dose of Covaxin on Thursday at a televised event with the health secretary of Tamil Nadu to encourage vaccination."
"Boom! Florida Governor Highlights Economic, Health Success While Signing Election Reform Bill",7 MAY 2021,840,"Florida is rapidly becoming the only free state in the Union, thanks to Governor Ron DeSantis. Conservative Treehouse explained: Governor Ron DeSantis appeared on Fox News this morning to highlight the economic success of Florida during the COVID crisis. As DeSantis notes because the state remained largely open the state did not need to touch its “Rainy Day Fund” to cover emergency expenses; and now the state is fully operational the revenues being generated are allowing the legislature to double the state emergency fund accounts. All of this despite Florida having no income tax. Additionally, DeSantis highlighted the growth in the state that allows the legislature to provide $1,000 bonuses to first responders; and introduces a new election reform bill recently passed by the state legislature, which he signed live on television."
Masks Can Actually Cause “Health Deterioration and Premature Death”: Can’t Block COVID,20 APR 2021,4560,"In a study (that sharing could get you banned from social media), Stanford learned what many scientists have been saying for months: masks don’t prevent COVID, and they can actually cause serious health problems, even premature death. The Gateway Pundit explained: A recent Stanford study released by the NCBI, which is under the National Institutes of Health, showed that masks do absolutely nothing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and their use is even harmful. NIH published a medical hypothesis by Dr. Baruch Vainshelboim (Cardiology Division, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System/Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States). NOQ Report uncovered the study: Did you hear about the peer-reviewed study done by Stanford University that demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that face masks have absolutely zero chance of preventing the spread of Covid-19? No? It was posted on the the National Center for Biotechnological Information government website. The NCBI is a branch of the National Institute for Health, so one would think such a study would be widely reported by mainstream media and embraced by the “science-loving” folks in Big Tech. Instead, a DuckDuckGo search reveals it was picked up by ZERO mainstream media outlets and Big Tech tyrants will suspend people who post it, as political strategist Steve Cortes learned the hard way when he posted a Tweet that went against the face mask narrative. The Tweet itself featured a quote and a link that prompted Twitter to suspend his account, potentially indefinitely. The NCBI study begins with the following abstract: Many countries across the globe utilized medical and non-medical facemasks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. Is has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidences with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing prosper information for public health and decisions making. The study concludes (emphasis added): The existing scientific evidences challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death. Governments, policy makers and health organizations should utilize prosper and scientific evidence-based approach with respect to wearing facemasks, when the latter is considered as preventive intervention for public health. Here is the full study: Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis by Baruch Vainshelboim What an absolute joke. America has been led down an insane path of wearing masks that according to this study don’t prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and cause more health risk than ever imagined.

TN County Votes To Strip Power From Health Board,30 MAR 2021,3171,"In Tennessee, there are a number of patriots working to stop encroaching socialism and slavery, and in Knox County (named for Henry Knox, hero of the Revolutionary War—See his awesome delivery of canon to Baltimore to save the town when NO ONE thought it was possible!!) the unelected Board of Health has been stripped of its power over the people. WATE reported: KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The Knox County Commission voted 8-3 to strip the Knox County Board of Health of its regulation-making power Monday night. The commission began these discussions late last year. This means the group will become an advisory board for county leaders when making decisions for residents regarding health regulations. A total of 17 members of the community spoke during public forum. All of them spoke out against the Board of Heath and urged commissioners to “do the right thing” and vote to take its power. When it came time to vote, Commission Chair Larsen Jay was the only commissioner to speak. “I’ve maintained from the beginning that if the state wants to change the form and the function of the Board of Health, that we would abide, yet still it has not. I continue to question based on the clearly written state law if the commission has the authority to establish an advisory board of health, but I’ll just have to simply disagree with our law department interpretation and move on,” Jay said. Commissioners Lundy and Durrett also voted against the ordinance. The remaining 8 commissioners voted in favor of it. Prior to the vote, one of the board members Dr. Patrick O’Brien sent a semi-resignation letter to the commissioners. Saying in the event that the ordinance is passed, he “does not feel he can adequately serve in the newly established advisory role.” After the vote, Dr. Buchanan said she was not surprised at the outcome. “This debate has been brewing for several months and the direction it’s going has become more and more clear. So you know as always as I’ve said this whole time no matter who is making the decisions, I will continue to follow public health science and make the recommendations that I think are the most appropriate for our community to keep our citizens safe,” Buchanan said. As for what happens next, Dr. Buchanan says she will have to consult with the law director to find out what happens to health policies that are currently in place. EARLIER: Knox Co. Commission set to vote on Board of Health power shift. KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The Knox County Commission is set to vote tonight on a proposed ordinance that would strip the Board of Health of its policy-making power. In December 2020, the commission passed the ordinance on first reading to move the Knox County Board of Health to an advisory role. In January, second reading was postponed for 90 days, set to be voted on in April. During the March 22 work session, the commission unanimously passed a motion to add the Board of Health ordinance to the March 29 regular voting meeting. Tonight’s meeting begins at 5 p.m. in the City-County Building’s Main Assembly Room. Thank you, County Commission!!! https://t.co/TF8veSTbd8 — Rep. Jason Zachary (@JasonZacharyTN) March 30, 2021"
"Health Care Worker Brags About Fake Vaccine Cards, “Karens” Immediately Pounce",29 MAR 2021,10404,"In an act of supreme idiocy (but a product of the social media generation who are desperate for attention) a health care worker bragged about getting fake vaccine cards for herself and her husband. Given the dangers of the vaccine (which are horrendous), her mistake appears to be posting it on TikTok, where subsequent Karens attacked and doxed her…. You know, for ‘safety.’ Yahoo ‘reported’: Before she wiped her page on Tuesday, TikTok user hann.brooke95 hadn’t been shy about sharing even the most mundane details of her life with her 19,400 followers. She posted TikToks of herself cooking while breastfeeding, the can of beans she was using for nachos, and even the painstaking process of transferring her license as a pharmacy tech from Florida to Illinois: from filling out the application, to affixing a return address label and stamp on the envelope, to dropping it in the mailbox in front of her house. And the stream of everyday minutiae might have continued if she hadn’t also used TikTok to brag about stealing COVID-19 vaccination cards from her job so she and her husband could pass themselves off as vaccinated. “I work at a pharmacy and grabbed blank ones for me and my hubby,” she wrote in the comments of another user’s TikTok about fake vaccination cards. It didn’t take long for fellow users Becca Walker and Savannah Sparks to zoom in on that return address label and match the name and address to public records for Hannah Brooke Hutchinson, 25, who is registered as a pharmacy tech in Illinois. Sparks then reported her to the same Illinois Board of Pharmacy that had just granted her license. The Illinois Board of Pharmacy told The Daily Beast it does not comment on investigations. “I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to steal from your job. And I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to steal blank vaccination papers for COVID-19 to falsify information and claim that you and your husband were vaccinated when in actuality you were not,” Walker said in a TikTok she posted to call her out. Hutchinson did not respond to multiple phone calls and texts sent to numbers associated with her and her boyfriend. But after Walker and Sparks posted TikToks about her, Hutchinson wiped her TikTok and deleted her Instagram and Facebook accounts. The Daily Beast, however, was able to review the zoomed-in image and independently confirm Hutchinson’s details, including her pharmacy technician license, through public records. Just before she wiped her TikTok, she posted: “Stop hating on me! I don’t care what any of you think. I did what is best for my husband and I.” Hours later she posted another TikTok claiming to be a 16-year-old girl in the U.K. doing an experiment for her dad, who is a filmmaker. But the TikToks, which went back a year, tracked with her husband’s Facebook page, which has also been deleted, where she appeared to be a mom in her twenties. “Very sick people come into pharmacies, so when you have a pharmacy employee lying about being vaccinated, everyone there is at risk,” Sparks, herself a pharmacist in Biloxi, Mississippi, told The Daily Beast. “I don’t want them in the profession.” But Hutchinson is far from the only health-care professional seemingly trying to fake her way into the vaccinated world, a trend that could have huge implications for the vulnerable Americans these employees serve. Since Monday, Walker and Sparks have combined, posted more than half a dozen TikTok videos calling out health-care workers who’ve talked online about forging or attempting to forge vaccine cards. And they say other users have sent them dozens more tips they haven’t been able to verify. “It’s overwhelming,” Sparks said. And public health experts warn it’s incredibly dangerous. “I’m just sitting here flummoxed, thinking about the implications of it all,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “Anyone who works in the health-care environment obviously contributes to the safety of the environment, which is their own safety, their colleagues’ safety as well as the patients they serve.” He said those caught doing it would likely lose their jobs, if not their careers. “We’re trying to make the whole health-care environment a COVID-free zone and by undermining that in a deliberate fashion, that’s beyond unprofessional. It’s profoundly unethical and contrary to whatever oath a health-care worker took when they accepted their degree. I would imagine there would be implications at the licensing level.” But fear of professional reprisal hasn’t kept some health-care workers from turning the taboo topic of vaccine hesitancy into clout-chasing fodder. Under Hutchinson’s original comment about pinching blank cards, Texas nurse Courtney Long wrote, “Can I pay you to ship a couple to me,” followed by a crying-laughing emoji. Sparks was able to identify Long through the Instagram profile Long included on her TikTok, where she talked about being a nurse, and a linked Facebook profile, under the name Courtney Renee Long, where she also talked about being a nurse. The Texas Board of Nursing’s website identifies a Courtney Renee Long as a Licensed Practical Nurse. “Is this you, Miss LPN?” Sparks said in a TikTok she made calling out Long. “Ah, yeah, the Texas Board of Nursing is gonna see all of this.” Sparks said she reported Long to the Texas Board of Nursing. When contacted by The Daily Beast, the board said it does not comment on investigations. The Daily Beast made a number of attempts to reach Long, through a number associated with family members’ phone numbers and Pinterest, the only social media account in her name that still existed as of Saturday. Calls to a number associated with her name and address were not returned. Sparks and Walker say they have also called out and reported an oncology nurse in Alabama, a trauma nurse at a children’s hospital in Philadelphia, and a receptionist at an asthma clinic. If it seems surprising that vaccine resistance would exist among medical professionals, even those with a strong background in science, Schaffer said it simply highlights how many Americans are still resistant to vaccination, more than three months after the first jabs went into the arms of frontline health-care workers. In February, a survey conducted by experts from Northwestern, Northeastern, Rutgers and Harvard universities found that 21 percent of health-care workers surveyed did not want to be vaccinated. Hesitancy, which indicates skepticism towards the vaccine but not an outright unwillingness to be vaccinated, was 37 percent. “There’s a large number who are not just indifferent but disdainful to the vaccine, they’re just not going to get it. And that’s the remnants of a political approach to COVID under the last administration,” Schaffner said. “It’s hard to unring that bell.” Of course, health-care workers aren’t alone among anti-vaxxers trying to pass as vaccinated and, on Thursday, the Office of the Inspector General warned those who’ve been vaccinated to not post images of their vaccine cards online because of an increase in fake cards. As more Americans get vaccinated, anti-vaxxers have turned to social media to drum up fears of a Biden-governed future in which those without vaccination cards will be turned away from restaurants, hospitals and even Target. “If they’re giving out a card to verify you’re vaccinated apparently there’s a reason for it. You might not be able to go shopping, to travel, to buy underwear,” TikTok user truevalor469 posted from a recliner earlier this month. “Hmm. Sounds like the beginning.” The backlash against Walker and Sparks’ crusade to uncover anti-vaxxer health-care workers on TikTok has been harsh. On Wednesday, Sparks changed her phone number after another TikTok user found it and began harassing her. The threats were so bad that on Friday, she had to issue a statement on her business website and shut down the reviews section. So far there are no government requirements to have a vaccination card, and Schaffner said he hasn’t heard of any private companies requiring them for either their employees or customers. Yesterday, Rutgers University in New Jersey became the first college to require students to be vaccinated but Schaffner said fears, widespread as they may be, are for now exaggerated. “By misrepresenting themselves they just avoid a lot of controversy,” he said. “So they’re doing this reprehensible thing to avoid discomfort and having to explain themselves and be responsible for their actions.” Walker said she suspects some of the users may not be as serious about faking their vaccinations as they are about chasing the clout that the taboo topic brings. “If you put up a TikTok saying, ‘Oh, I don’t want to get vaccinated. Sell me a vaccine card,’ that’s an automatic 100k views,” Walker told The Daily Beast. One TikTok user by the name linds3r commented on a viral TikTok about faking vaccination cards, writing, “I got a template if u want it” and, later, “lol I (have) made 8 of them so far front and back.” That user, Lindsey Stauffer, says on Facebook that she is an employee in medical billing at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. She also makes and sells anti-Biden and pro-Trump shirts from her Facebook page, which includes several of the same images from her TikTok. Reached by The Daily Beast, Stauffer admitted to writing the posts but denied she’d made eight cards. “I didn’t write about making them. I said I know where you can get one. You can go to Google right now and pull up images about it yourself,” Stauffer told The Daily Beast. “I’m not making anything. Anyone can access it.” Stauffer also denied living in Lebanon, though the phone number used to reach her lists that as her address. She denied working at the VA despite listing it as her employer on Facebook. (The federal Department of Veterans Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) Stauffer also said she had been vaccinated already. “So why would I need to make them?” she told The Daily Beast. But even when medical professionals joke about forging their vaccination, Schaffner said, it can create problems. “When people hear that health-care workers are doing this, it undermines the faith the public has in these institutions and their ability to keep them safe,” Schaffner said."
"Vaccine Deaths Will Be Blamed On ‘New Variants’ To Restore Full Control, Health Minister Sounds Alarm",3 MAR 2021,10494,"The COVID vaccine, many experts warn, is designed to make your body a time bomb. As soon as it is administered, the countdown begins. For some, such as infants, the elderly, and babies not yet born, it causes immediate death. For others, it will cause death as soon as that person is exposed to a similar virus in the ‘wild.’ mRNA vaccines are highly experimental, but many people argue that the purpose of this particular vaccine is depopulation on a massive scale, which will then be blamed on ‘new variants’ of COVID. Children’s Health Defense reported: While in January a group of independent doctors concluded that experimental COVID-19 vaccines are “not safer” than the virus itself, a new analysis of vaccine-related death rates in Israel demonstrates that this may indeed be the case to dramatic levels. A re-analysis of published data from the Israeli Health Ministry by Dr. Hervé Seligmann, a member of the faculty of Medicine Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases at Aix-Marseille University, and engineer Haim Yativ reveal, in short, that the mRNA experimental vaccine from Pfizer killed “about 40 times more (elderly) people than the disease itself would have killed” during a recent five-week vaccination period. Among the younger class, these numbers are compounded to death rates at 260 times what the COVID-19 virus would have claimed in the given time frame. While the full mathematical analysis may be found in the article itself, the authors demonstrate how among “those vaccinated and above 65, 0.2% … died during the three-week period between doses, hence about 200 among 100,000 vaccinated. This is to be compared to the 4.91 dead among 100,000 dying from COVID-19 without vaccination.” “This scary picture also extends to those below 65,” the researchers continued. During the five-week vaccination process “0.05%, meaning 50 among 100,000, died. This is to be compared to the 0.19 per 100,000 dying from COVID-19 (who) are not vaccinated … Hence the death rate of this age group increased by 260 (times) during this five-week period of the vaccination process, as compared to their natural COVID-19 death rate.” As reported by IsraelNationalNews (INN), Seligmann is of Israeli-Luxembourg nationality, has a biology degree from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and has written more than 100 scientific publications. INN reports the researchers “have no conflicts or interests other than having children in Israel.” Yativ and Seligmann stipulate that even these “estimated numbers of deaths from the vaccine are probably much lower than actual numbers as it accounts only for those defined as COVID-19 deaths for that short time period and does not include AVC and cardiac (and other) events resulting from the inflammatory reactions.” Nor do these numbers “account for long-term complications,” they write. In addition, within several months they expect “mid- and long-term adverse effects of the vaccination as ADE (Antibody-dependent Enhancement)” begins to become manifest in those who have received the experimental Pfizer vaccine. As explained by America’s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS), ADE “is when anti-COVID antibodies, created by a vaccine, instead of protecting the person, cause a more severe or lethal disease when the person is later exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the wild. The vaccine amplifies the infection rather than preventing damage.” AFLDS provides an example of a vaccine produced to fight the Dengue fever, which resulted in deaths of 600 children in the Philippines due to ADE, and the filing of criminal charges against the decision-makers in 2019. For these reasons and more, AFLDS and many other doctors strongly discourage the use of these experimental vaccines for most people while only acknowledging that it may be plausible for those over 70 years of age, yet acknowledging that such injections are “a higher risk than early or prophylactic treatment with established medications” (sources here, here, here, and here). Given these death rates, Yativ and Seligmann also have harsh criticism for the severe pressure being imposed upon the population by Israeli authorities to receive these shots. According to INN, the researchers call these draconian efforts “a new Holocaust.” In the past weeks, Israel’s government made headlines when they adopted a “green pass” system, allowing people who have been injected to receive a green code, which then grants them entry into places such as entertainment and leisure facilities. As the country reopens after a two-month lockdown, the green pass would be given only to those who had been injected, not to people who tested negative for the virus. The proposed benefits include access to “non-essential” businesses as well as not being required to self-isolate if identified as a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID-19, and not having to self-isolate after a return from what the government calls a “red location.” Despite there being no proof that these experimental vaccines actually prevent transmission of the virus, Israel’s minister for health, Yuli Edelstein, said upon the release of the vaccine “passport” that “(g)etting vaccinated is a moral duty. It is part of our mutual responsibility.” He went further, declaring, “Whoever does not get vaccinated will be left behind.” The green pass needs renewing every six months, and despite holding one, an individual must still abide by masking and physical distancing rules. The Jerusalem Post also reported that legislation is being considered to grant employers the right to refuse unvaccinated people entry into the workplace. Such measures prompted Business Insider to describe the country as “waging a war on the unvaccinated.” Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, has styled Israel’s vaccination response as “extraordinarily good.” Web MD previously reported: Only 17% of doctors say they will get a COVID-19 vaccine if it is authorized before all clinical trials have been completed, according to results of a Medscape poll. The poll asked doctors and nurses how likely they were to order or use treatments or vaccines if the FDA grants emergency use authorization before phase III trials are completed. The poll was first posted on Medscape.com on Sept. 2. Of those responding, 17% of doctors said they would order or use the vaccine; 63% said no; and 20% said they were unsure. Younger doctors were more likely to say they would not get a vaccine under such circumstances (68% of those younger than 55 years said no, vs. 61% of those ages 55 years and older.) The Washington Post reported last week that the FDA is expected to roll out a tough new standard for emergency authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine. Nurses were less likely than doctors to say yes (11%); 69% said no; and 20% said they were unsure. Answers did not vary substantially by age. The poll was taken after Medscape Editor-in-Chief Eric Topol, MD, wrote to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Aug. 31, detailing why he thinks recent emergency use authorizations (EUAs) of interventions to treat COVID-19 have not been based on evidence. Topol cited three EUAs specifically: one for hydroxychloroquine on March 30 (revoked in June for lack of evidence), one for convalescent plasma on Aug. 23, and an expanded EUA for remdesivir to treat any patient hospitalized for COVID-19, not just those with severe disease. The letter, which was also posted online, drew more than 500 comments. Another poll question concerned the use of plasma collected from survivors of COVID-19 as a treatment for the disease. The National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines committee said this month that current data is insufficient to recommend using convalescent plasma to treat patients who have COVID-19. The poll asked doctors and nurses if they would or have ordered convalescent plasma for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Nine percent of doctors and 2% of nurses said they had ordered it; 28% of doctors and 40% of nurses said they would. On the other hand, 44% of doctors and 29% of nurses said they would not. The rest were unsure. One ear, nose, and throat doctor who responded to the poll wrote, “As to whether or not I would consider prescribing convalescent plasma for a seriously ill COVID patient, yes I would. And if I ever found myself falling off a cliff, I would try to grab onto any twig projecting from the cliff.” But the responder said the biggest problem with the EUA for plasma was the “false claims about efficacy.” “The data are not convincing of its efficacy for COVID-19, and convalescent plasma had no significant effect in Ebola. The best situation for using plasma would be in a clinical trial.” Doctors and nurses were also asked whether they would order, or have ordered, remdesivir, given the available clinical trial evidence that supported the EUA. Doctors were more likely to say they had or would order it (42%) than were nurses, at 37%. But in both groups, there was much uncertainty about the drug. Only slightly more doctors (44%) said no than said yes, and 14% were unsure. Among nurses, 39% said no and 24% were unsure. Among doctors, answers on remdesivir differed by work setting. Whereas 37% of hospital doctors said they would or had ordered remdesivir, 52% of those who were office-based answered that way. Overall, most doctors and nurses (about 60%) reported they had not treated patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Commenters had different views on the evidence behind EUAs. Some stood by their support for hydroxychloroquine, even though the EUA for it was revoked on June 15. A reader who agreed with Topol’s criticism of the EUAs wrote, “People in significant leadership roles must be held accountable for their actions. If you serve in an office and are receiving intolerable political pressure from superiors to take actions that are inconsistent with your training and personal integrity, then you have but a few options. “Convince your superiors of their misguided directives or resign. History is not going to be kind to those who have supported these unscientific and completely inappropriate positions.” A registered nurse wrote that issuing the EUA can discourage completing clinical trials. “The saddest thing isn’t so much that EUAs are allowed in emergencies (if truly believed potential benefit outweighs potential risk), but when it is allowed to get in the way of well-planned and designed research that can actually determine its true usefulness,” she wrote.  "
"COVID Bill Contains Pork For All Biden’s Cronies, 5% Slated For Health Needs",19 FEB 2021,4033,"The COVID bill being pushed by Biden and democrats includes wads of cash for all democrats’ pet donors, but only 5% for health needs related to COVID… a quintessential PORK-packed payback. FEE.org reported: But a top budget watchdog just warned that the budget-busting legislation, which costs roughly $13,260 per federal taxpayer, is full of spending that has nothing to do with the pandemic. “Only about 1 percent of the entire package goes toward COVID vaccines, and 5 percent is truly focused on public health needs surrounding the pandemic,” the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) warned on Wednesday. “Meanwhile, nearly half of the package will be spent on poorly targeted rebate checks and state and local government aid, including to households and governments that have experienced little or no financial loss during this crisis,” the report continues. Even some of the money that is ostensibly related to COVID-19, like billions intended to help schools reopen, is highly misleading. For example, as CRFB senior policy director Marc Goldwein notes, much of this money for “school reopening” is actually allocated for 2023 and 2024, long past when all schools will have reopened. More broadly, the committee reports that at least $300 billion of the bill’s spending, 15 percent, is allocated toward long-standing policy priorities that have no direct relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The bill includes a number of other long-standing priorities, such as expanding the child tax credit and earned income tax credit, increasing Affordable Care Act subsidies, and boosting the minimum wage,” CRFB president Maya MacGuineas says. “These policies don’t belong in a COVID relief package, and should be fully offset if retained.” That Congress would co-opt the COVID-19 crisis to push partisan priorities and hand out wasteful slush-funds will understandably appall many Americans. But it shouldn’t really come as a surprise. Washington’s propensity for waste, cronyism, and profligacy is no secret at this point. Senator Rand Paul’s annual “Waste Report” documents examples of profligate government waste every year. Of the countless billions in total waste documented by the senator’s office, memorable examples include subsidizing frog mating, taxpayer support for the Pakistani film industry, studying nicotine-addicted fish, funding for Sri Lankan think tanks, and taxpayer money spent to combat truancy… in the Philippines. Waste is a feature, not a bug, of how Congress routinely handles our money. And it’s also, sadly, par for the course that legislators slip unrelated provisions into bills seen as “must-pass” to quietly force through changes they know would never become law as stand-alone legislation. For example, Congress passed a massive “omnibus” spending bill paired with COVID-19 relief legislation in December. The legislation was 5,500+ pages long and given to most members of Congress hours before the vote was scheduled. It was full of bizarre expenditures—like more than $40 million for the Kennedy Center and seemingly random foreign aid funding. In reality, none of it is random. The money for “school reopening” long after schools are reopened is really a generic handout for teachers’ unions—which donate heavily to many members of Congress—masquerading as emergency COVID relief. Similarly, each odd pet project or earmark can usually be tracked to a particular interest group or individual with sway over a given politician. This is, unfortunately, simply the status quo of how the federal government operates. So, it’s utterly unsurprising that policymakers are taking this same pork-filled approach with the latest legislation. But the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s warning suggests it could be even worse this time than in past bills. We already knew that Biden’s budget-busting COVID-19 “stimulus” proposal wasn’t actually going to stimulate the economy and itself contains job-killing provisions.

"Biden Immediately Moves To Jeopardize Americans, Create Health Pandemic With Open Borders",21 JAN 2021,5009,"Instead of working to prevent higher COVID infection rates, Joe Biden took immediate action to place more Americans in jeopardy yesterday with a new immigration policy. Conservative Treehouse reported: While putting the health and well-being of American citizens at risk…. The JoeBama administration has decided to suspend all deportations and open the U.S. border to accept thousands of illegal aliens without concern for spread of COVID-19. (Source) NHPR reported: The newly inaugurated Biden administration wasted no time in taking two major steps to dismantle much criticized Trump-era immigration policies in their first day in office. The Department of Homeland Security announced that starting Thursday, it would pause deportations for certain non-citizens in the U.S. for 100 days and would stop new enrollments in the Migrant Protection Protocols policy, also known as the “remain in Mexico” program. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary David Pekoske said the U.S. “faces significant operational challenges at the southwest border as it is confronting the most serious global public health crisis in a century.” Pausing some enforcement measures gives the agency breathing room as the DHS plans to fully review current programs and U.S. immigration policies, Pekoske said in a memo issued late Wednesday. Pekoske’s memo directed DHS sub-agencies Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services “to review and reset enforcement policies and set interim policies for civil enforcement while the Department develops its final priorities.” The department aims to focus its resources “where they are most needed,” Pekoske said. In light of the serious challenges at the southern border, DHS must “surge resources” to the area to ensure “safe, legal and orderly” immigrant processing. ‘Remain in Mexico’ ends The Trump administration’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy requiring asylum seekers trying to enter the U.S. from the southern border to wait in Mexico for American court hearings will be suspended. The program has led to roughly 60,000 migrants getting sent back across the border since MPP was first implemented in January 2019. Tens of thousands of people are still stuck in Mexico, awaiting their court hearings, and living in unsanitary and potentially dangerous situations. The policy has placed enormous strain on Mexico, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic. [Under Biden’s new policy, these illegal aliens will be allowed to enter and escape into the U.S.] Thousands more migrants from Latin America have pushed their way toward Mexico in recent days. Some have told journalists that they are making their way north because they expect it to be easier to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Others say the economic situation and violence in Honduras has made remaining there untenable. The increase in migrants, however, promises even more stress on Mexico and the U.S. immigration system. On Sunday, Guatemalan security forces confronted a caravan of migrants from Honduras. Guatemalan security forces in the country’s southwest attempted to block thousands of Honduran migrants from heading north towards Mexico and the U.S. border. Some migrants have been able to skirt security forces by moving off of the main roads, according to officials in Guatemala. Mexico, however, has implemented their own strict border security forces, making crossing into the country difficult for many travelers. Guillermo Díaz, Guatemala’s top immigration official, said at least 7,000-8,000 Hondurans had crossed into Guatemala in an “irregular” manner. Legalization path limited Karen Tumlin, founder of the Justice Action Center, an organization providing legal aid to immigrants, called the step to end MPP “huge.” Tumlin wrote on Twitter that, “It confirms the Biden-Harris commitment to restoring dignity to our asylum system. Here’s to the next, critical steps to remedy the inhumane impacts of this shameful program.” However, immigration hard-liners such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform are already set to oppose the Biden administration’s immigration plan. “We hope fervently that when it comes to dealing with immigration, the new administration will seek to find common sense policies that not only serve to enhance the economic recovery from COVID, but provide lasting security and prosperity for the country,” said Dan Stein, president of FAIR, a day before Biden’s inauguration. “President Biden must protect American jobs and not capitulate to special interests pushing radical policies that put Americans last,” During the moratorium on MPP, current COVID-19 non-essential travel restrictions — both at the border and in the region — remain in place. But it is unclear what will happen to migrants already enrolled in MPP. The DHS said, “All current MPP participants should remain where they are, pending further official information from U.S. government officials.”"
"New York Plans ‘Concentration Camp’ Detainment, Forced Vaccinations In Sneaky New ‘Public Health’ Law",2 JAN 2021,12915,"If you’ve ever wondered how the Nazis were able to forcibly confine citizens… simply look to the laws they passed. New York legislators appear to understand this perfectly.

Boston Liberals Consider Confiscation of “Private Property” Using COVID “Public Health” Excuse,25 NOV 2020,3273,"If you think that COVID was anything other than a vehicle to usher in the end times, you’re wrong. Not only have American citizens been subjected to police state tactics of “stay at home” orders and forcible masks, now it seems that the geniuses in Boston have hit upon another way to use the fake ‘pandemic’ to steal the individual rights of citizens. Property confiscation in the name of “public health.” Conservative Treehouse reported: Boston authorities are now contemplating the confiscation of private property under the guise of COVID-19 mitigation or “public health”, because they need to house/detain people in socially distant venues.   The COVID provides a reason to confiscate private domicile. Massachusetts – […] Could the city commandeer vacant private properties to help supplement supply? Leo Beletsky, a law and health sciences professor at Northeastern University, presented the controversial move to city officials during a virtual hearing last week, according to the news station. “When you commandeer a property, there is no preliminary process. The government just comes in and takes over private property,” Beletsky told the outlet. “There’s a long tradition of doing that in the United States,” he added. “This is not some radical idea.” While Beletsky’s proposal was met with swift opposition, he said the practice could quickly remedy a solution to the pressing problem. “Lives certainly take precedence over private property interests, especially when private property owners will be compensated,” Beletsky said. “This could also apply to all the hotels that are sitting empty.” (read more) “FUNDAMENTAL CHAINS” – What they are planning to do is weaponize COVID-19 to attain ideological objectives. This is why they hyped the fear within it for almost a year. Nothing within their plan requires the approval or consent of any representative body in Washington DC. COVID is the tool to “fundamentally change” the way the United States exists. Think about the federal government using mandates for enforced national COVID-19 compliance rules. Think about USDA (Dept of Agriculture) and OSHA federal inspections for social distancing (etc) in all businesses, not just restaurants. Think about the COVID-19 regulatory and compliance system and what political beneficiaries stand to gain. Think about the Dept of Education using COVID to restructure the way education is taught and the downstream regulations on charter schools and non-compliant educational systems that do not meet the ideological objectives of the master control plan. Think about how the Dept. of Labor (complaint division) can be weaponized against political opposition based on arbitrary inspections under the guise of employee health and safety…. using federal COVID compliance rules. Think about Housing and Urban Development (HUD) having new rules about dwellings and complexes for housing grants. Population density; the need to move into the suburbs and the confiscation of private property to “ensure the common safety” of the citizens.  (read more) Personally, I think that the first order of business (after establishing a national, paper ballot and counting system for all elections) should be the complete reformation of the public school system and higher education."
Pew Research: White Liberals Highest Ranking Group “Diagnosed” With Mental Health Condition,12 OCT 2020,2444,"In a series of tweets, Zack Goldberg with Information Liberation reported on Pew Research that shows white people who categorize themselves as “very liberal” have been diagnosed with the highest numbers of mental health conditions. Since the polls was conducted back in March, these numbers could have easily increased. Goldberg reported: One look at an antifa protest could tell you this but it’s nice to have some data. 1/n Two interesting findings thus far from my analysis of Pew’s March 2020 COVID-19 survey. First, white (and especially ‘very’) liberals are far more likely than all other ideological-racial subgroups to report being diagnosed with a mental health condition. pic.twitter.com/RynS9lk0jR — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020   2/n Somewhat surprisingly, this difference further grows when we add standard controls pic.twitter.com/2VM3DD2HJI — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020 3/n We next turn to mean responses to this battery, which asks about the frequency at which respondents experienced specific mental health issues over the previous 7 days pic.twitter.com/2zisVK5ItD — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020 4/n The differences are more modest here, but still significant pic.twitter.com/eGeyPEpONU — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020 5/n They are also robust to several potential confounds (e.g. job loss, pay-cuts, marital status) pic.twitter.com/1YE76bEbKc — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020   6/n However, entering the ‘mental health diagnosis’ variable into the model does (perhaps naturally) narrow the difference. pic.twitter.com/E22JIYwgRi — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020 7/n In other words, at least some of the differences in the covid-mental health battery between white liberals and others are accounted for by the former's higher likelihood of being diagnosed with a mental health condition. — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020 8/n It’s possible that the disparities in self-reported diagnosis are simply or partly a function of white liberals being more likely to seek mental health evaluations. I don’t have the data to answer this question. But given that they also tend to score higher on neuroticism.. — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) April 11, 2020 There’s a lot of social pressure on white liberals to identify as mentally ill to boost their social status in the oppression olympics. Just being a straight white male is considered downright detestable."
"Health Dept. Claims “Scam” After Over 7,000 People Told They Tested Positive for COVID",16 SEP 2020,2964,"On one North Carolina county, over 7,000 people were told they tested positive for COVID… but it was a lie. BREAKING REPORT: Thousands In North Carolina's Mecklenburg County INCORRECTLY TOLD THEY HAVE COVID-19 In Alleged ‘Technical Glitch’… — Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) September 15, 2020 The Charlotte Observer reported: More than 6,700 people in Mecklenburg County received text messages from the county Health Department on Friday that they had tested positive for COVID-19. And more than 500 people were told the same news via a county email. But it was a mistake. It’s not known how many of the thousands who received the messages actually have COVID-19, had tested positive at one point or never had the coronavirus. Regardless, none of them should have gotten such a text or email from the county, because the county does not give people results that way. At 9:30 a.m. Friday, the county tweeted that those messages from the health department were a scam: “Public Health does not send out COVID-19 testing results via text message.” But five hours later, the county updated its tweet: “These texts were sent due to a technical glitch in the software system that has been addressed by the software provider.” Top of Form Bottom of Form In an email Monday, County Manager Dena Diorio told county commissioners that the texts were sent through British Columbia-based HealthSpace Data System. The county began using software from the Canadian company in late May to help with case investigation and contact tracing efforts — part of a contract worth $157,800 over five years. Diorio said 6,727 text messages and 541 emails were sent to people who were already in HealthSpace’s system. That means they could have tested positive for COVID-19 once — and likely already recovered — or they are thought to have had close contact with someone who had the novel coronavirus. The vendor sent a corrected text or email to everyone who had received incorrect information, Diorio said in the email to commissioners. It was not known whether some people got erroneous texts as well as emails. “We apologize for any alarm this caused citizens who were not supposed to be sent an alert or survey,” HealthSpace CEO Silas Garrison said in a statement on Friday. Friday’s error was another stumbling block for contact tracing, where the public is asked to provide confidential health information in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Case investigators — the first layer in the contact tracing process — are trained to probe for contacts’ names, employers, phone numbers and home addresses, among other details. Contact tracers then use that information to call people who potentially were exposed. The county uses HealthSpace software to automate some portions of the contact tracing process. From the start of the pandemic, Mecklenburg Public Health Director Gibbie Harris has detailed residents’ mistrust or unwillingness to comply with contract tracers. [Duh.]"
Texas Dept. Of Health Numbers Show COVID Less Lethal Than Common Flu,15 JUL 2020,1013,"If you think that America is on the verge of another epidemic of COVID fatalities, think again. Data released by the Texas Department of Health shows that the Chinese-created virus is less lethal than the common flu. The Texas Department of Health released numbers recently comparing the coronavirus to the last two seasonal flu viruses, and the results are stunning. COVID was actually less lethal than the flu in the state, over the last two years. The flu had a mortality rate of 0.03 percent and 0.04 percent, while the coronavirus has a mortality rate of 0.01 percent in Texas. In fact, a few people have pointed out that if a democrat was president right now… there would only be a slight mention that ‘flu deaths’ were up this year.

Trump Formally Withdraws From World Health Organization,8 JUL 2020,3005,"President Trump made good on another of his promises yesterday by formally withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization. Breitbart News reported: The Trump administration has formally withdrawn the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), as the United Nations-backed agency continues to face fierce criticism over its response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ). Menendez, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote on Twitter that the Trump administration has pulled out from the WHO. Menendez wrote: Congress received notification that POTUS officially withdrew the U.S. from the @WHO in the midst of a pandemic. To call Trump’s response to COVID chaotic & incoherent doesn’t do it justice. This won’t protect American lives or interests—it leaves Americans sick & America alone. Congress received notification that POTUS officially withdrew the U.S. from the @WHO in the midst of a pandemic. To call Trump’s response to COVID chaotic & incoherent doesn’t do it justice. This won’t protect American lives or interests—it leaves Americans sick & America alone. — Senator Bob Menendez (@SenatorMenendez) July 7, 2020 In May, President Donald Trump announced that the US. would end ties with the WHO, citing the “malfeasance” of China, whom he accused of orchestrating a “coverup” regarding the origins of the coronavirus. “China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year,” the president noted at the time. Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus. It repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,” and said its work and commitment to transparency were “very impressive, and beyond words.” But behind the scenes, it was a much different story – one of significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found. Despite the plaudits, China in fact sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information. Tight controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were to blame, according to dozens of interviews and internal documents. Chinese government labs only released the genome after another lab published it ahead of authorities on a virologist website on Jan. 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on providing WHO with detailed data on patients and cases, according to recordings of internal meetings held by the U.N. health agency through January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed."
Kentucky Gov. Spouts Slave-Owner Mentality Promising Free Health Care For Only Blacks,9 JUN 2020,2595,"Yesterday, the democrat governor of Kentucky said that his administration would work to provide free health care… but only for blacks. The move reminded many people of slave-owners, who provided free healthcare for their field hands because a healthy slave was more valuable. Breitbart News reported: In his address Monday, Beshear stated that he believes “health care is a basic human right.” While he specifically focused on black residents in the state, he also said he would like to improve health care in the state for “everybody.” “My commitment today is we are going to begin an effort to cover 100 percent of our individuals in our black and African-American communities—everybody,” Beshear said. “We’re going to be putting dollars behind it, we’re going to have a multi-faceted campaign to do it. But it’s time, especially during COVID-19, when we see what happens when you don’t have coverage. We need to make sure everybody does.” [COVID is extinct, but of course, there’s no reason why a democrat won’t continue to capitalize on a lie, right?] Beshear continued, saying it was time to give health care “prioritization” to the black American community: Today, I’m going to make a commitment on coverage. I believe that health care is a basic human right and I talked about when I was running that I wanted everybody to have some form of health care coverage. Well, as I’ve been listening and as I’ve been trying to hear from those who have been giving voice on in inequality, it is that it’s time to give prioritization in black and African-American communities, so we are going to do that. Beshear said the coronavirus exposed the inequalities in health care among black and white residents in the United States as African Americans died at a much higher rate than white people. “In our health care system, the inequality of our system have been laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic,” Beshear continued. “By allowing this type of inequality to exist for as long as it has, we see African-Americans dying at twice the rate that they make up of the population. That simply cannot be allowed to continue any longer.” “It shouldn’t have taken this kind of pandemic and it shouldn’t have taken these types of demonstrations for us to commit to ending it,” Beshear added. According to the 2018 American Community Survey, there are an estimated 20,000, or 5.8 percent, uninsured black Kentuckians. The same survey revealed the state’s overall uninsured rate to be 5.6 percent. In total, black Americans make up about eight percent of Kentucky’s population. Watch the racist diatribe below:"
"Expert Explains Face Masks Are “Serious Risk” To Healthy, Make COVID More Deadly",16 MAY 2020,7424,"New information about face masks has emerged, warning healthy people of the dangers of wearing them. In fact, according to a neurosurgeon, they can make contracting COVID-19 much more deadly. PJ Media reported: Every Karen on Facebook is shaming her neighbors for not wearing a face mask. We are being told by governors that if we don’t wear masks we are selfish, horrible human beings with no souls who want Grandma to die a horrible death. Police are tackling people who don’t wear face masks properly in the subway. Grocery stores are throwing maskless people out and denying them service. But now, there’s another doctor weighing in—besides Dr. Fauci, bonafide sex god and ruler of us all, who also said face masks are largely security theater and of no use to the healthy. Dr. Russell Blaylock, a neurosurgeon, has written an editorial saying that “masks pose serious risks to the healthy.” First, Blaylock says, there is no scientific evidence that masks are effective against COVID-19 transmission. Pro-science people should care about this. As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, “None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”    Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission. It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history. Beyond the lack of scientific data to support wearing a mask as a deterrent to a virus, Blaylock says the more pressing concern is what can and will happen to the wearer. Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications. There are studies to back that claim up. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches. They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death. A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask. Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance. Blaylock says studies have also shown that face masks impair oxygen intake dramatically, potentially leading to serious problems. The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome. In other words, if you wear a face mask and contract some sickness, you will not be able to fight it off as effectively as if you had normal blood oxygen levels. The mask could make you sicker. It could also create a “deadly cytokine storm” in some. There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number. How about cancer, heart attacks, and strokes? Blaylock says face masks can make all of those conditions worse. People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers. Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases. If that’s not bad enough, how would you like COVID-19 in your brain? It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain. In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Why is it that we only listen to dire predictions from Dr. Fauci and we don’t consult other experts in the field of medicine? Is Anthony Fauci the only qualified person to talk about this virus? Furthermore, if he is, he agrees with Dr. Blaylock that only sick people should wear them and he said so on 60 Minutes. So why aren’t we listening to him?"
Nadler Health Expert? Dem Claims “Thousands” Will Die If Economy Is Reopened,30 APR 2020,2243,"Jerry Nadler is apparently now a health expert. He appeared on MSNBC yesterday to claim that “thousands” more people will die if the economy is reopened. Townhall reported: Rep. Nadler accused the president of rushing the reopening process to boost his chances of winning re-election. “In terms of reopening, we have to be very, very careful. I know that the people are eager to reopen businesses. There are several things to consider. Number one, people are not going to come back to restaurants so fast when they’re worried about their own health. So that’s a little premature. Second of all, you can’t reopen businesses until we have enough testing that has been done. And far from enough testing has been done to justify allowing people to reduce the social distancing requirements,” Nadler said. “Again, we know that President Trump is trying to — for political reasons because he wants the economy to look good before his re-election, he’s trying to disregard the science and disregard the medical advice and get the businesses open again. But if that happens, it’s going to lead, predictably, to a lot more people getting sick and to another surge of the virus, another surge of sicknesses,” he continued. Tur asked if the House is reconsidering the deadline for businesses to rehire workers in order for the Paycheck Protection Program loans to be forgivable, since there might be a second wave of the coronavirus in the fall. “We’re going to have to eliminate various deadlines or put them off for a long time…flow with it, not with artificial politically motivated deadlines. Now the president is trying to impose artificial politically motivated deadlines so that the economy can look good before the third quarter for the election,” Nalder said. “But if that happens, we’ll simply get a lot — thousands and thousands of more people dead and we can’t do that.” The White House coronavirus task force unveiled the guidelines for states to meet in order to reopen their economies and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 such as: Many people disagree, including a number of front-line ER doctors and specialists… but Americans are supposed to ignore those scientists and listen to a man who couldn’t master portion control his entire life?"
YouTube Declares War On Any Information That ‘Contradicts’ World Health Organization,27 APR 2020,3697,"If you are hoping to have alternative views about the COVID-19 outbreak… ones that don’t parrot the World Health Organization’s apparent falsehoods, don’t look for it on YouTube. The platform has just declared war on the First Amendment right (again), banning all content that doesn’t goosestep along with the UN body’s declarations. Of course, WHO is a proven liar with a sinister global agenda, according to facts and experts. Townhall reported: YouTube’s CEO Susan Wojcicki‎ has declared that they will “remove any content that goes against WHO recommendations” on the coronavirus pandemic, essentially censoring any opinion other than that of the World Health Organization. This is not the first time YouTube has censored information with which it disagrees. Last year, the online streaming site said it would censor videos that do not agree with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s exaggerated claims about global warming. This move by YouTube sets a dangerous precedent for censorship and has the potential to restrict the flow of information from competing sources—something that has been essential to the discovery of both truths and falsehoods and so to the growth of knowledge. If anything, YouTube should be cautious of WHO, and not the other sources. It was WHO that made big blunders. In January, WHO declared that COVID-19 was not transmittable from humans to humans. WHO relayed the same information on its website, YouTube, and Twitter. WHO tweeted, “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.” Three months down the line, the world finds itself in the midst of a catastrophic pandemic driven by human-to-human transmission. Does YouTube care about this blatant error and how much it has cost governments and populations that were left unprepared because of it? Instead, YouTube recognizes WHO as the ultimate authority on the COVID-19 pandemic and is ready to blindly censor any opinion contrary to WHO’s. However, YouTube is not alone in this war on information. YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook removed posts by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro which contained information on the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. There is absolutely nothing controversial about his posts, as the efficacy of the drug in treating COVID-19 is currently being tested by the United States Centers for Disease Control. The President of United States even requested India to release the drug to other countries, and India agreed. Interestingly, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube did not ban the White House official briefings that contained information on hydroxychloroquine. So, social media CEOs get to choose who’s lucky and who’s not. YouTube is known for courting controversy with censorship, especially on the issue of climate change. In 2018, YouTube experimented with labeling videos that did not comply with the popular climate doomsday theory perpetrated by the United Nations and other climate alarmists. Earlier this year, a Democrat senator demanded that YouTube take down videos that do not comply with the United Nation’s view on extreme climate change and its belief about an imminent climate doomsday. YouTube is perilously close to being a science denier by choosing to promote only one side of the coin on issues of critical global socio-economic significance. It is ironic that YouTube accuses those censored as spreading “misinformation” while simultaneously deciding to consider organizations like WHO and the UN as ultimate authorities despite their own serious errors on climate change and COVID-19."
"Former Clinton Advisor And Others Call For Biden Mental Health Exam, Alzheimer’s Disease Check",9 MAR 2020,4182,"Joe Biden is being pushed as the democrat nomination choice for the presidential race, but his ability to actually carry it off (despite what many experts argue is a concerted and deliberate effort to rig the race for him) is questionable. Biden’s mental health problems seem to be increasing. Over the weekend, his ‘gaffes’ were stunning. Former Clinton advisor Dick Morris has actually said that Biden should be checked for Alzheimer’s disease. The Washington Examiner reported: “I don’t think that Biden has much of a chance of defeating Trump. I think that Biden is a very fragile candidate,” Morris told radio show host John Catsimatidis on Sunday. “He has risen from the dead, but the ashes still remain. I think he’s incredibly vulnerable on the Hunter Biden issue. I think his gaffes raise serious questions about his mental ability.” Biden, 77, has often mixed up details in the stories he tells on the campaign trail, bringing scrutiny about his ability to be an effective counterpuncher to Trump. “Biden should be required to have a test for Alzheimer’s disease. We can’t elect a president who has that deterioration of the brain setting in at the start of his term,” Morris said. “We’re entitled to know that. His personal inability to function will become more and more apparent, particularly on the debate stage. … He’s becoming senile or coming down with Alzheimer’s.” Biden’s doctor released a report on the former vice president’s health in December that said he is being treated for an irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, acid reflux, and seasonal allergies. His doctor added that Biden was a “healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.” The report did not mention any declining cognitive ability or mental function. Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak, in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas, also pointed out glaring issues with Biden’s acuity: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Joe Rogan has also remarked on his radio program on the difference between the media establishment’s persecutions of President Trump compared with Biden’s apparent free walk. Trump was subjected to segment after segment of so-called ‘experts’ questioning his mental health, despite not having the evidence of ‘gaffes’ to use… so where are these experts now? Why haven’t they raised concerns over Biden’s potential dementia? Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found I finally agree with Joe Biden on something!

California Expands Healthcare Coverage For Illegals,11 JAN 2020,1784,"While California is reeling under a homeless epidemic that has been labeled a serious crisis, Governor Gavin Newsom has decided to spend more of the state’s taxpayer funds on providing even more healthcare coverage for illegals. The move has many people scratching their heads in wonder at the sort obtuse idiocy that seems to characterize Newsom. In fact, the efforts to recall him have increased. The Washington Free Beacon reported: California governor Gavin Newsom on Friday announced his state spending plan to extend health care coverage to illegal immigrants who are seniors under California’s Medi-Cal program, a part of his most recent effort for statewide health care coverage. “The Budget also moves the state toward universal coverage and furthers cost containment goals by expanding full-scope Medi-Cal coverage to low-income undocumented Californians aged 65 and above,” Newsom’s office wrote in a statement. During his tenure, Newsom has proven his commitment to spend taxpayer money on partisan agendas. Last July, California expanded Medi-Cal coverage for low-income illegal immigrants between the ages of 19 and 26 after expanding coverage in 2016 for all children under the age of 18, including minors who are illegal immigrants. In October, Newsom signed a bill to force all public university campuses to provide abortion pills for students.Top of Form Bottom of Form Medi-Cal is funded by the state as well as the federal government, but federal funds do not cover the cost of health care for illegal immigrants so the taxpayer-funded coverage will come from the state’s pocket. So, the hard-working citizens of California will be forced to subsidize a group of invaders even further, while they are also forced to watch crime, disease, and homelessness increase."
Google Secretly Collected Private Health Info On Tens Of Millions Of Americans,12 NOV 2019,6916,"You may not know it, but Google may have all of your private, detailed health information, and is using it to profit… you know… for your own good. Working with one of the largest healthcare systems, the secret projected has collected data on tens of millions of patients in 21 states. The Wall Street Journal reported: The initiative, code-named “Project Nightingale,” appears to be the biggest effort yet by a Silicon Valley giant to gain a toehold in the health-care industry through the handling of patients’ medical data. Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven’t yet struck deals of this scope. Google began Project Nightingale in secret last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, a Catholic chain of 2,600 hospitals, doctors’ offices and other facilities, with the data sharing accelerating since summer, according to internal documents. The data involved in the initiative encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth. How ‘Project Nightingale’ uses data Data that is shared includes: Neither patients nor doctors have been notified. At least 150 Google employees already have access to much of the data on tens of millions of patients, according to a person familiar with the matter and the documents. In a news release issued after The Wall Street Journal reported on Project Nightingale on Monday, the companies said the initiative is compliant with federal health law and includes robust protections for patient data. Some Ascension employees have raised questions about the way the data is being collected and shared, both from a technological and ethical perspective, according to the people familiar with the project. But privacy experts said it appeared to be permissible under federal law. That law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, generally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used “only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.” Google in this case is using the data in part to design new software, underpinned by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning that zeroes in on individual patients to suggest changes to their care. Staffers across Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent, have access to the patient information, internal documents show, including some employees of Google Brain, a research science division credited with some of the company’s biggest breakthroughs. Google Cloud President Tariq Shaukat said the company’s goal for health care is centered on “ultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs, and saving lives.” [Yeah, right.] Eduardo Conrado, an executive vice president at Ascension, said: “As the health-care environment continues to rapidly evolve, we must transform to better meet the needs and expectations of those we serve as well as our own caregivers and health-care providers.” Google and nonprofit Ascension have parallel financial motives. Google has assigned dozens of engineers to Project Nightingale so far without charging for the work because it hopes to use the framework to sell similar products to other health systems. Its end goal is to create an omnibus search tool to aggregate disparate patient data and host it all in one place, documents show. The project is being developed under Google’s cloud division, which trails rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in market share. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has said repeatedly this year that finding new areas of growth for cloud is a priority. Ascension, the second-largest health system in the U.S., aims in part to improve patient care. It also hopes to mine data to identify additional tests that could be necessary or other ways in which the system could generate more revenue from patients, documents show. Ascension is also eager to have a system that is faster than its existing decentralized electronic record-keeping. Google, like many of its Silicon Valley peers, has at times drawn criticism for not doing enough to protect user privacy. Its YouTube unit agreed in September to pay $170 million in fines and change its practices in response to complaints that it illegally collected data on children to sell ads. YouTube neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Last year, the Journal reported that Google opted not to disclose to users a flaw that exposed hundreds of thousands of birth dates, contact information and other personal data of subscribers in its now-defunct social-networking website Google Plus, in part because of fears that the incident could trigger regulatory scrutiny. Google said at the time it went beyond legal requirements in determining not to inform users. Regulators are now scrutinizing the company on a number of fronts. Federal and state investigators over the summer made public separate antitrust inquiries into Google. The federal probe is examining whether Google’s existing trove of data amassed from its flagship search engine, home speakers, free email service and numerous other arms give the company an unfair advantage over competitors, people familiar with the matter said. Google has said its products increase consumer choice and that it is committed to cooperating with the inquiries. This year, Mr. Pichai has touted new privacy protections for Google’s billions of users. The company made public this month a $2.1 billion deal for wearable fitness maker Fitbit Inc., which makes watches and bracelets that track health information like a person’s heart rate. Politicians of both parties quickly criticized the deal; Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, warned that the Fitbit deal would give Google “deep insights into Americans’ most sensitive information.” The companies said they would be transparent about any Fitbit data they collect. Google appears to be sharing information within Project Nightingale more broadly than in its other forays into health-care data. In September, Google announced a 10-year deal with the Mayo Clinic to store the hospital system’s genetic, medical and financial records. Mayo officials said at the time that any data used to develop new software would be stripped of any information that could identify individual patients before it is shared with the tech giant. Google was founded with the goal of organizing the world’s information, and health has been a fascination of its top executives from the early days. Google Health, a fledgling effort to digitize existing medical records, was shut down in 2011 after three years of limited adoption. Alphabet has since poured millions of dollars into its under-the-radar Calico and Verily divisions, which aim to combat aging and manage disease, respectively. Yeah, right."
Federal Judge Controls Nation: Rules Healthcare Workers Forced To Violate Religion,7 NOV 2019,2377,"In the United States of America, one unelected man or woman is NOT supposed to have the power over the entire nation, but that is what has been happening over the past three years. And now, one federal judge has ordered that the religious freedom, provided by the constitution and reinforced by the Trump administration, is not valid for healthcare workers. Basically, the New York activist judge ruled that health care providers are not allowed to refuse to perform services that violate their religious beliefs, like abortions. The Hill reported: A federal judge in New York on Wednesday struck down a Trump administration rule that would make it easier for health care providers to refuse to perform services, such as abortions, that conflict with their religious beliefs. District Judge Paul Engelmayer invalidated the rule on multiple grounds, including a finding that it violated the Constitution’s spending clause by allowing the administration to cut off funds approved by Congress to providers who do not comply with the rule by forcing employees to perform services to which they object. A number of states, including New York, as well as Planned Parenthood and other groups had sued over the rule, which was scheduled to go into effect on Nov. 22. They argued the rule would allow for discrimination in the name of religious freedom. [Ridiculous.] “Today’s decision is an important victory against the Trump Administration’s cruel and unlawful attempts to roll back critical patient protections,” Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “Everyone is entitled to their religious beliefs, but religious beliefs do not include a license to discriminate, to deny essential care, or to cause harm to others.” The Trump administration had touted the rule as important protection for people’s religious beliefs, specifically citing abortion. “This rule ensures that healthcare entities and professionals won’t be bullied out of the health care field because they decline to participate in actions that violate their conscience, including the taking of human life,” Department of Health and Human Services official Roger Severino said when the rule was proposed in May. Now, the case will likely proceed to a higher court, where the whims and biases of one unelected person will not be able to impact the entire nation."
"Elijah Cummings Dead From Health Complications, Tweeting ‘Journalists’ Attack Trump",17 OCT 2019,4099,"Elijah Cummings, a key democratic Congressman who was an extremely vocal opponent of President Trump and his policies that have restored the American economy, passed away early this morning from “longstanding” health complications. President Trump tweeted his condolences, but such messages are apparently disgusting to one PBS journalist, and a number of others. My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace! — Donald J.

The procedure already caused Cummings to miss a September hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood. The statement didn’t detail the procedure. He previously was treated for heart and knee issues. Cummings had represented Maryland’s 7th congressional district since 1996. May God have mercy on his soul."
Dem’s Wife “Rants” That Obamacare ‘Gold’ Plan Won’t Pay All ‘Mental Health Therapy’,11 SEP 2019,2911,"The Bible mentions three things that are never satisfied, and four that never say ‘enough!’ (Proverbs 30:15), but perhaps something could be added to that list… democrats. Congressman Joe Cunningham’s wife is angry that taxpayers aren’t footing the bill for her “mental health therapy sessions.” Apparently, having hard-working Americans pay three-quarters of her health costs just isn’t enough. The Free Beacon reported: Democratic congressman Joe Cunningham’s wife is furious that their taxpayer-subsidized healthcare plan declined to pay for therapy sessions, according to a rant on an insurance bill she posted on Instagram. The South Carolina Democrat is currently serving his first term in Congress, where members are given access to Obamacare “gold” plans from Blue Cross Blue Shield and are responsible for paying about a quarter of the premiums. The plan is apparently not good enough for his wife, Amanda Cunningham, who told her Instagram followers she would be urging her husband to do something about it. “I’m gonna have a little bit of a rant here on social media because I think this is important,” she said on her Instagram story last week. “I’ve been going over my not-a-bill bill here from Blue Cross Blue Shield, and realizing that once again, all of my mental health therapy sessions are denied, in addition to all of our marriage counseling sessions.” “It’s just mind-blowing to me that these basic well-known needs, that mental health is health care, are still being denied, that we’re still fighting for these absolutely basic things, it’s unbelievable to me,” she said. “So I’m reaching out to my congressman—yes, also my husband—but saying, like, hey, what can we do about this? Let’s go to the House floor, let’s write a bill, I don’t know what you do, but let’s do it because this is ridiculous.” “This affects us, our family, it affects everyone else who’s seeking mental health and needs support doing so,” she concluded. “I’m just flabbergasted.” Cunningham’s office did not respond to an inquiry into whether he agrees with his wife’s assessment of the plan, but he wouldn’t be the first freshman member dissatisfied with the Obamacare plan they’re given. The Washington Free Beacon reported that Rep. Cindy Axne (D., Iowa) complained to a group of constituents that she doesn’t get “good insurance.” “You really don’t want what I have, because I don’t get good insurance,” Axne said. “It’s okay insurance. Just so you know, congresspeople, we have to purchase from the ACA [Affordable Care Act], we purchase from the network.” Amanda Cunningham, a licensed yoga instructor, sold her ownership stake in a South Carolina yoga studio earlier this year, according to a profile of her in Charleston’s Post and Courier. She now works part-time as development director for a nonprofit helping vulnerable women. The couple met as crew-members on a luxury yacht, according to the profile."
"Whoops! 91-Year-Old Trashes Kamala, ‘Leave Our Healthcare Alone!’",13 AUG 2019,3277,"Don’t you just love the logic and plain speaking of an elder? Kamala Harris is probably regretting her encounter with one 91-year-old lady in Iowa after being treated to a dose of reality. Harris was stumping in what she apparently thought would be a good photo-op location, a senior assisted living facility. She started spewing her lies and feel good pie-in-the-sky socialist policies, but one elderly woman called her on it! She asked her flat out who was going to pay… Harris’ answer was typical democrat fakery. Way to go, granny! Fox News reported: Presidential primary candidate Kamala Harris was confronted on Monday by an upset Iowa resident over the California senator’s plan to overhaul health care in the United States. The Democrat was speaking to voters at the Bickford Senior Living Center in Muscatine, Iowa, when one of the center’s residents challenged her on how she planned to pay for “Medicare for All” and told her not to “mess with” health care. “Leave our health care alone,” Roberta Jewell, a 91-year-old resident at the senior living facility, told Harris as she was describing her campaign’s health care proposal. “We don’t want you to mess with it.” Harris responded that she doesn’t intend to mess with anyone’s health care, but to make sure that everyone has the coverage they want. “I want to make sure that it’s the way you like it,” she told Jewell. “I promise you that. I won’t mess with the health care that you have.” The conflict with the senior resident in Iowa highlights Harris’ problem explaining her stance on health care to voters. Last month, Harris – in an attempt to appeal to both the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic Party – released one of the more confusing and vague health care proposals of the campaign season. Harris’ plan did little to unite the divided factions within the Democratic Party, with progressives taking issue with the presidential candidate for stopping short of the full-scale health care overhaul embodied by the “Medicare for All” legislation. Her more moderate rivals, meanwhile, said she was trying to have it all without taking a firm position on one of the most animating issues in the primary. “Medicare for All” has become a central focus in the Democratic primary, with the most progressive candidates calling for a revolutionary approach to providing government insurance coverage for all Americans at a lower price than the private market. But, Harris split from that approach on several fronts. She envisions a role for private insurers as long as they follow the government’s rules. She would slow the transition to a so-called single-payer system to 10 years from the four that her rival in the primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has proposed. And she has ruled out tax increases on middle-income Americans, an idea to which Sanders has expressed openness in exchange for lowering the price of health coverage. Harris has repeatedly been forced to clear up her stance on “Medicare for All.” She previously appeared to suggest that she supported abolishing private insurance but later clarified that she does not. Of course, don’t expect Kamala to have learned anything. Most likely, she’s simply dismissed the intelligence and logic of the woman without a second thought."
California Points The Way: Illegal Invaders Given Taxpayer-Funded Healthcare,10 JUL 2019,1639,"In California, they aren’t content with giving their safety away to the illegal invaders who prey upon Americans… they want to give all their money away too. Fox News reported: Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., signed a bill into law on Tuesday making young illegal immigrants eligible for the Medicaid program in California, making it the first state to offer such taxpayer-funded health benefits to low-income adults age 25 and younger regardless of their immigration status. State officials said they expected the plan to cover about 90,000 people and cost taxpayers $98 million. California already covered children 18 and younger regardless of immigration status. The law will not give health insurance benefits to everyone 25 and younger, but only those whose income is low enough to qualify. Newsom and fellow Democrats in the state legislature said they planned to expand coverage to more adults in the years to come. Advocates of the measure have called it a way to improve the health of immigrants in the state by providing them with access to the medical care they need. Many immigrants in the country illegally already have been enrolled for some government-funded programs, but they covered only emergencies and pregnancies. Democrats had pushed to expand the coverage to even more adults, but Newsom rejected the proposals, saying it would cost about $3.4 billion to provide coverage to all California adults living in the country illegally. But, he still has vowed to keep expanding coverage in future years. This seem idiotic in a state that is overrun with illegal invaders who live on the streets and attack innocent Americans."
DNC Chair Defends Free Healthcare For ‘Undocumented’ Invaders,1 JUL 2019,1752,"After every democrat contended for the 2020 race raised their hands in support of making taxpayers foot the bill for illegal invaders’ healthcare costs, Tom Perez, chair of the DNC went on Fox News Sunday to double down on the so-called ‘reasons’ these criminals have the right to our hard-earned money. Breitbart news reported: Perez said, “It’s an insurance program, so you got to pay into it. Immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, pay billions of dollars in taxes. That is the reality.” [Wrong. Most of them do not claim enough income—if they even fill out tax returns—to qualify to pay federal income taxes. They are a drain on the American economy to the tune of over $100 billion dollars a year in the free benefits they already get!] He continued, “Democrats believe that you should be able to buy into a health insurance system. It is not a handout.” [Wrong. This is the definition of a hand out and would destroy the best healthcare system in the world.] He added, “I live in a community right now where if you are a pregnant woman and you are undocumented, we provide you with access to health care because we believe that having good prenatal care is an essential health care issue an essential issue of economics and frankly an essential issue of morality. The party of Lincoln is dead, and one of the things that died with it is compassion, and this is not a handout. again, this is allowing people to buy into an insurance program, people who pay billions of dollars in taxes.” ‘Allowing’… doesn’t he mean forcing people!? Democrats have been railing against Lincoln since he was elected for one reason: They hate anyone and anything that takes away their slave-holder standing. Tom Perez’ arguments were idiotic and illogical.  "
New York Bans Choice: Public Health More Important Than ‘Freedom Of Religion’,15 JUN 2019,3360,"The state of New York has eliminated the public’s right to claim religious exemptions for vaccination. The move, which was signed into law minutes after the measure passed, infuriated parents and defenders of individual liberty. Now, in New York, parents do not have any say-so whether their children will be vaccinated or not… if they want to send their kids to public schools. The Associated Press reported: The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents to cite religious beliefs to forego getting their child the vaccines required for school enrollment. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure minutes after the final vote. The law takes effect immediately but will give unvaccinated students up to 30 days after they enter a school to show they’ve had the first dose of each required immunization. With New York’s move, similar exemptions are still allowed in 45 states, though lawmakers in several of them have introduced their own legislation to eliminate the waiver. The issue is hotly contested and debate around it has often been emotional, pitting cries that religious freedom is being curtailed against warnings that public health is being endangered. After the vote in the Assembly, many of those watching from the gallery erupted in cries of “shame!” One woman yelled obscenities down to the lawmakers below. …. “I’m not aware of anything in the Torah, the Bible, the Koran or anything else that suggests you should not get vaccinated,” said Bronx Democrat Jeffrey Dinowitz, the bill’s Assembly sponsor. “If you choose to not vaccinate your child, therefore potentially endangering other children … then you’re the one choosing not to send your children to school.” Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York’s Capitol for the vote to protest. Stan Yung, a Long Island attorney and father, said his Russian Orthodox religious views and health concerns about vaccines will prevent him from vaccinating his three young children. His family, he said, may consider leaving the state. “People came to this country to get away from exactly this kind of stuff,” Yung said ahead of Thursday’s votes. Supporters of the bill say religious beliefs about vaccines shouldn’t eclipse scientific evidence… “I’m old enough to have been around when polio was a real threat,” said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, D-Manhattan. “I believe in science…. Your personal opinions, which may be based on junk science, do not trump the greater good.” … Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday that he believes public health — and the need to protect those who cannot get vaccinated because for medical reasons — outweighs the concerns about religious freedom. “I understand freedom of religion,” he said. “I have heard the anti-vaxxers’ theory, but I believe both are overwhelmed by the public health risk.” So, if it’s for the ‘good of the public,’ your religious convictions mean nothing. Of course, the move could have a benefit these liberal masters didn’t recognize. People could simply move out of state and/or home school their children so that the massive socialist indoctrination is also avoided. Sadly though, it’s likely that New Yorkers will simply roll over and allow the injustice. And then continue to vote democrats rulers into power, losing more and more of their God-given rights."

Leftists Furious! President Extends Religious Protection For Health Care Workers,3 MAY 2019,6223,"According to democrats, health care workers should be, oppressed, bound and forced to reject their personal religious beliefs and conduct elective procedures that violate deeply held convictions. That means that democrats, like the slave masters they’ve historically been, demand that health care workers ignore their constitutional protections and perform abortions and transgender ‘care.’ However, President Donald Trump yesterday announced a new regulation that would protect them. Although it seems odd that a ‘regulation’ has to be defined to ensure health care workers can exercise their freedoms, the move has been met with furious hate by liberals and the leftist media. The Associated Press called it part of the president’s ‘anti-abortion’ agenda, reporting: Advancing his anti-abortion agenda, President Donald Trump moved Thursday to protect health care workers who object to procedures like abortion on moral or religious grounds. President Trump chose the National Day of Prayer to announce the new regulation. “Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities,” Trump told an interfaith audience in the White House Rose Garden. “They’ve been wanting to do that for a long time.” The conscience rule would protect these people from being forced to choose between their livelihood and their religious convictions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was one of the democrats who demand health care workers remain slaves to the whims of any ‘tolerance’ claim they make. She said, “these bigoted rules are immoral, deeply discriminatory and downright deadly, greenlighting open discrimination in health care against LGTBQ Americans and directly threatening the well-being of millions. “Make no mistake,” she added, “this is an open license to discriminate against Americans who already face serious, systemic discrimination.” She said she was also addressing another pending regulation seen as undermining the rights of transgender patients and added that the House would “fight” the administration’s actions. It’s “immoral” to protect someone’s right to choose their own actions?! It’s “discriminatory” to NOT force people to perform procedures that go against their moral conscience?! The Associate Press added: San Francisco immediately sued the Trump administration, saying the conscience regulation will undermine access to care. The complex rule runs more than 400 pages and requires hospitals, universities, clinics and other institutions that receive funding from federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to certify that they comply with some 25 federal laws protecting conscience and religious rights. Most of these laws and provisions address medical procedures such as abortion, sterilization and assisted suicide. The ultimate penalty can be loss of federal funding for violations of conscience or religious rights, but most cases are settled by making changes in practices and procedures. The rule makes no new law and doesn’t go beyond statutes passed under administrations of both political parties, said Roger Severino, head of the office that will enforce it at the Department of Health and Human Services. Rather, the regulation will guarantee that religious and conscience protections already on the books can’t be ignored. “We are giving these laws life with this regulation,” said Severino, saying it’s no different from civil rights statutes enforced in daily life through government regulation and oversight. “It makes sure Congress’ protections are not merely empty words on paper.” Under the rule, clinicians and institutions would not have to provide, participate in, pay for, cover or make referrals for procedures they object to on moral or religious grounds. This will make it “so that people do not have to shed their religious beliefs to participate in health care,” said Severino, adding that “certain medical professions such as OB-GYN should not be declared pro-life-free zones.” The rule also addresses conscience protections involving so-called advance directives that detail a patient’s wishes for care at the end of life. Asserting that previous administrations have not done enough to protect conscience rights in the medical field, HHS under Trump created a new division to investigate such complaints within its Office for Civil Rights, which Severino heads. HHS said last year the office received more than 1,300 complaints alleging discrimination in a health care setting on account of religious beliefs or conscience issues. There was only a trickle of such complaints previously, officials said, about one per year for alleged conscience violations. Sister Carol Keehan, head of the Catholic Health Association, said her group representing church-affiliated hospitals, nursing homes and other providers will stress continued service to “all persons.” “Our mission and our ethical standards in health care are rooted in and inseparable from the Catholic Church’s teachings about the dignity of the human person and the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death,” Keehan said in a statement. “These are the source of both the work we do and the limits on what we will do. Every individual seeking health care is welcome and will be treated with dignity and respect in our facilities.” Among religious conservatives, Family Research Council leader Tony Perkins called the regulation an answer to prayer. “Protecting the right of all health care providers to make professional judgments based on moral convictions and ethical standards … is necessary to ensure that access to health care is not diminished, which would occur if they were forced out of their jobs because of their ethical stances,” his statement added. But Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the administration has opened the door to discrimination. “Religious liberty is a fundamental right, but it doesn’t include the right to discriminate or harm others,” she said. “Denying patients health care is not religious liberty,” That’s a ridiculous assertion. So, religious liberty doesn’t exist if someone decides to demand an offensive procedure? Insane."
Obama Pushes People To ‘Sign Up’ After Judge Rules Socialist Healthcare Unconstitutional,16 DEC 2018,2303,"Barack Obama took to social media yesterday to urge his followers to ignore the ruling issued Friday by a federal judge and go ahead and sign up for free government healthcare anyway. One day after a Texas judge struck down the former president’s signature legislation as unconstitutional, the former demagogue seemed to treat the ruling as if it meant nothing. “You might have heard about a federal court decision on a Republican lawsuit trying to strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety,” he said in Facebook post. “As this decision makes its way through the courts, which will take months, if not years, the law remains in place and will likely stay that way.” The ruling, Obama claimed, “changes nothing for now.” The phrase ‘you might have heard’ seems entirely appropriate for Facebook audiences, many people agree, given the censorship that is growing on that platform against ‘fake news.’ U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor cited both a Supreme Court ruling and recent Congressional law to strike down the massive, expensive socialist healthcare plan as unconstitutional. “The remainder of the ACA is non-severable from the individual mandate, meaning that the Act must be invalidated in whole,” O’Connor wrote in a 55-page opinion. “A lot of good people are fighting to ensure that nothing about your care will change. The ACA protects your pre-existing conditions, no matter how you get your insurance,” Obama promised yesterday. Many people wonder if this will go the way of all his other ‘promises.’ “But all of this should also be a reminder that Republicans will never stop trying to undo all that. If they can’t get it done in Congress, they’ll keep trying in the courts, even when it puts people’s pre-existing conditions coverage at risk,” the egomaniac opined. Today is the last day of open enrollment. That means it’s the deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019. So head over to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod to get covered! Here’s what else you need to know today about health care: pic.twitter.com/gosn6c6uCa — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 15, 2018 The ruling was a win for all liberty loving people who don’t want to see the greatest healthcare in the world transformed into the inefficiency and waste that characterizes the VA."
Healthy Lawmaker ‘Poisoned’ After Getting Flu Shot,29 NOV 2018,2892,"New York State Senator Jose Peralta was pro-vaccine, but his widow is speaking out after his body poisoned itself. The 47-year-old politician got a flu shot a couple weeks before he died, and reports say he thought his symptoms were a result of the vaccine. Although there is no way to know whether the flu shot was a cause in the bizarre death, it is worth mentioning that the young man hadn’t shown any previous problems and was in fact described as healthy. Peralta passed away on Thanksgiving eve in Elmhurst Hospital after developing a fever and later became “disoriented and had trouble breathing.” He had reportedly been feeling sick for at least two weeks before his death and, according to the Associated Press, Mrs. Peralta had told reporters that her husband felt pressure behind his ears and headaches for a week or more. As a result, he visited a doctor. The New York Times quoted Sen. Peralta’s director of communications, Chris Sosa, as stating “It was like pulling teeth to get him (Peralta) to talk about not feeling well. He just thought he was having symptoms related to getting the flu shot.” Peralta’s wife told reporters at the New York Post her husband’s ‘body was poisoning itself’ to death. Evelyn Peralta said her husband suffered sudden septic shock after experiencing two weeks of flu-like symptoms. “All they said is that he was septic,” she said after meeting with the city Medical Examiner’s office. “And that led to organ failure,” she added, “They need to do additional tests.” “There is no final conclusion yet. They don’t know” what caused the fatal blood infection, she said. “His body was poisoning itself.” Tearfully she continued, “I just came back from viewing the body. The doctor said it’s rare, [given] his age and that it happened so quick … he was healthy. He was a healthy guy.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, common side effects of the vaccine include soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot, headache, fever, nausea and muscle aches. The flu shot can also cause fainting and has been associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which is inflammation of the peripheral nervous system. It can create “severe allergic reactions that may be fatal, including difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, swelling around the eyes or lips, hives, paleness, weakness and a fast heartbeat or dizziness. There are ingredients in influenza vaccines that can cause some people to have reactions.” Peralta, who was the first Dominican-American member of the New York state senate, had his funeral held Tuesday morning. “Jose Peralta was a proud son of Queens and the Dominican Republic. He worked his way up from the grassroots, with heart and tenacity. Chirlane and I are both pained by his sudden loss. Our prayers are with his wife Evelyn and his sons,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. The death is both sad and tragic."
Audit Shows California Spent $4 Billion On Illegible People For Government Healthcare,1 NOV 2018,2909,"According to an internal audit, California spent $4 billion in taxpayer funds paying for people who are not eligible to receive their free socialist healthcare coverage. The money was wasted in Medi-Cal coverage between 2014 and 2017. “Medi-Cal provides health coverage for 13.1 million Californians, approximately one-third of the state’s population.” To qualify for the socialist handout, a single adult must make less than $16,754 each year. But apparently, the records between county and state officials don’t match up in some cases, leading to the massive waste. And, this isn’t the first problem the bloated program has had. The audit found 453,000 people marked as eligible in the state’s system, but not in the county records. A number of factors could contribute, such as people dying or moving, or increasing their income, but it points to the very real problems associated with government healthcare. Like the VA, the gigantic bureaucracy is rife with inefficiency and waste. California’s Department of Health Care Services paid $4 billion to health plans and doctors for those ineligible beneficiaries. “The audit found that 57 percent of the discrepancies lasted for more than two years.” The LA Times reported, “In one instance, a Los Angeles County resident died in December 2013, yet the state continued to make monthly payments to the beneficiary’s Medi-Cal health plan until August of this year.” According to the audit, the leftist state shelled out $383,000 for a person who the state “should have known was no longer in need of services.” “Although Health Care Services has established a process for notifying counties of beneficiary records that require follow-up, gaps in this process allowed the problems we identified to persist,” State Auditor Elaine Howle wrote in a letter to the Legislature. But the mistakes aren’t just for people who don’t need the service, approximately 54,000 could have gotten free healthcare, but bureaucratic delays cost them. “These individuals may have experienced hardships in accessing health care services, as they would have been denied benefits until the system discrepancies were resolved,” the audit says. “The audit recommended that the department implement a better system by the end of the year and recover erroneous payments by June. The department said it agreed with the recommendations but could not comply with them within that timeline.” So basically, the state of California has admitted that they can’t deliver free medical in a way that’s workable without wasting billions of dollars. Many people agree that taking healthcare away from the private sector is a death warrant. It doesn’t work, unless the people all agree to become slaves of the state. In England, families have been forced to accept the ‘no-treatment’ the national service decides to doll out, and if they could leave to find better care, the country will not allow it."
Senate Defeats Measure That Attempted To Reign In Health Insurance Choices,10 OCT 2018,4118,"Democrats have shifted their focus from their attempt to impugn Brett Kavanaugh to health care. However, earlier today, their scheme was dealt a blow when a bill to overrule a President Trump health care law fell flat. On Wednesday, a leftist measure to overrule President Donald Trump’s expansion of short-term health insurance plans was defeated on a narrow, almost party-line vote. Many speculated that the left forced the vote in hopes that they could campaign off of it. Although Susan Collins defected to the democrats, but the leftists still couldn’t win. President Donald J. Trump expanded short-term health insurance plans, which didn’t meet ‘Obamacare’ ‘qualifications,’ and which didn’t have to cover pre-existing conditions, or cover mental health services or prescription drugs, looking to provide an option for people who couldn’t afford the expensive ACA-approved options. Democrats sought to overrule Trump’s plan to provide more options to consumers. The vote ended up an evenly split 50-50, thanks to Senator Susan Collins, a ‘republican’ (or a republican in name only) from Maine who voted in a solid bloc against the idea of allowing health insurance consumers to have more choice when it came to their health options. When democrats brought forward the measure, they argued that the plans were “junk” insurance plans, and they seemed to think that they could use the plans to pain the republicans as wrong on health care in the public eye. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York proclaimed from the floor of the Senate that in a few weeks, the American people would be able to choose between candidates like him who would “safeguard protections now in place” in the American insurance market, or republicans who he said would “gut our health-care system.” It’s strange to hear someone suggest that more options, especially options that could work for people who are short on cash, somehow qualifies as ‘gutting’ a health-care system. Furthermore, the idea that it is ‘our’ health care system is a dishonest one. Schumer, like every other politician on Capitol Hill, does not use the same health system as the general public. Senator Lamar Alexander, a republican from Tennessee, pointed out that the short-term plans offered consumers a cheaper choice, and that for those who didn’t want such a plan, Barack Obama’s government healthcare was still available, further raising questions as to how the health insurance options were ‘gutted.’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior republican Senator from Kentucky, said that his constituents deserved more options when it came to their health insurance choices, not fewer, and that the democrat plan to destroy one of the options that was still “actually working for American families” was a poor one. Once again, ‘republican’ Susan Collins showed that she is a republican only when she feels like it, and that when push comes to shove, she is easily convinced to vote against her party. In this case, she caved because left-leaning ‘experts’ claimed that the audacious idea of allowing people choices would take money out of the hands of the ‘insurance pools’ for Obamacare plans, which would raise premiums on people who chose to participate in them. In other words, because leftists know better than consumers what level of insurance they need, other options, not approved by the ‘Affordable’ Care Act, which passed without a single republican vote, should not be allowed to exist. It seems to most people the only ‘choice’ that democrats are really in favor of is the ‘choice’ to abort a child. Short-term plans allowed those who utilized them to carry insurance, for a much lower price than the ‘approved’ plans, in exchange for reduced coverage. Obamacare was pushed by leftists in the government in part because they decided that insurance plans needed to meet their ‘requirements,’ since, again, consumers and plebs obviously couldn’t be trusted to make choices about their health insurance needs on their own. However, those who pushed for greater choices, and a wider variety of options for consumers, came out on top."
CA Gov. Candidate Calls For Free Healthcare For Illegals In State,29 AUG 2018,2965,"Democratic candidate for Governor of California Gavin Newsom stunned many this week when he bizarrely claimed that illegal aliens in his state should receive “free” healthcare and benefits. His plan, many would attest, is illegal, as taxpayer funds cannot be used for those who do not have legal authorization to be in the U.S. During an interview on “Pod Save America,” a podcast hosted by former Obama officials, Newsom endorsed the idea of a universal healthcare program that would use taxpayer funds to cover millions of illegal aliens who live in California. Newsom must believe Americans are stupid enough to think such a radical proposal will work. Or, on the contrary, he may be stupid enough to not see how catastrophic the idea would be on the U.S. economy. Newsom, who is running against Republican candidate John Cox — a Trump-backed businessman — in November’s general election, was asked about notable Democrats pushing a “Medicare for All” program, which numerous studies have shown would likely bankrupt the country over time. Building off the idea, Newsom went on to suggest that everyone — regardless of their immigration status — living in California could be eligible for the program, assuming it ever passed and was signed into law. “I did universal health care when I was mayor– fully implemented, regardless of pre-existing condition, ability to pay, and regardless of your immigration status,” Newsom said. He added: “San Francisco is the only universal health care plan for all undocumented residents in America. Very proud of that. I’d like to see that extended to the rest of the state.” Of course, San Francisco is also denigrating into a cesspool-like existence with dirty needles and feces lining the streets and a homeless situation that’s nearly out of control. Californians and wealthy elites may be looking past Newsom’s admitted adultery, laundry list of wealthy donors, and insistence on defying the Trump administration — but supporting this socialist idea likely won’t sit well with many. If an immigrant doesn’t enter the United States through a port of entry or doesn’t have authorization from the federal government, that is against the law. So, why should American taxpayers be forced to pay millions of dollars in order to ensure criminal aliens — who broke the law to enter the country — receive healthcare and medical treatment at no cost to them? Newsom is either incompetent or utterly delusional, some would argue, if he doesn’t see that such a radical proposal would only invite more illegal aliens to make attempts to infiltrate the nation. On top of that, studies have shown that the socialist “Medicare For All” proposal would cost U.S. taxpayers $32.6 trillion in additional spending over ten years. Newsom is apparently unbothered by this, and has made it clear to many that he is far more concerned with prioritizing illegal aliens over hard-working, legal American citizens. Listen to Newsom’s comments below."
"Sen. Paul Introduces Pro-Life Bill Amendment To Defund Planned Parenthood, Fund Local Health Centers",23 AUG 2018,5812,"Just recently, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) proposed adding what many conservatives would view as an absolutely amazing pro-life amendment to a recent Senate funding bill, otherwise known as HR 6157. If adopted by the legislature, Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics would consequently be defunded of tax dollars and the money would then, quite incredibly, be redirected to local community health centers that do not perform abortions.    To justify his introduction of the amendment, the senator released a statement to his fellow republican lawmakers who claim to be pro-life that “this is our chance” to let their actions speak louder than words.   Specifically, Sen. Paul stated, “one of the top priorities for a Republican Congress that professes pro-life values on the campaign trail should be to stop taxpayer funding for abortion providers. This is our chance to turn our words into action, stand up for the sanctity of life, and speak out for the most innocent among us that have no voice.” By saying this, Paul, who’s also an ophthalmologist, is basically pointing out that if republicans in congress truly care about saving the lives of unborn children and cutting off taxpayer funds to so-called “death clinics” like Planned Parenthood, then supporting his amendment would be a great way to prove that this is actually the case.   During an interview about a similar piece of legislation that he previously proposed, he noted, “I think we can have disputes, you know, over abortion. Our country is divided. Some people are pro-choice, some are pro-life. I think most people do want to defund this…It would be much less emotional for everyone if we just funded community health centers and didn’t fund Planned Parenthood.” Despite this, Dr. Paul mentioned that he didn’t agree with some of his colleagues about shutting down the government down over the issue. “I support any legislation that will defund Planned Parenthood,” Paul explained, adding, “but I don’t think you start out with your objective to shut down [the] government.” Thankfully, Sen. Paul isn’t the one person who’s been actively trying to protect the lives of unborn children. For example, last month, Father Dave Nix, Father Fidelis Moscinski, Will Goodman, and a woman who was only identified as “Baby Jane Doe,” were all taken into custody for refusing to stop praying inside of an abortion clinic located in the nation’s capital or cooperate with law enforcement officials for approximately two whole hours. Apparently, the four individuals were reportedly conducting a so-called “Red Rose Rescue,” which supposedly involves distributing red roses and quietly speaking with and praying for women who are considering ending the life of their unborn child. And back in December 2017, the Pennsylvania House Health Committee voted in favor of a piece of pro-life legislation that would completely ban dismemberment abortions if it’s ever passed. In addition to that, if the bill ever becomes a law, doctors would also be barred from performing abortion procedures on women who are more than twenty weeks pregnant. Unfortunately, though, while various people, who many would recognize as being motivated by compassion, are trying to do everything they can to protect the lives of the unborn, others, who many would agree are far less compassionate, are pushing to make it easier to kill fetuses while they’re still in the womb. A few weeks ago, for instance, a lawsuit was filed against the state of Idaho by the Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands over a law mandating that licensed abortion clinics, hospitals, and physicians file a detailed report any time a there’s a complication with an abortion procedure. Specifically, while medical officials are still required to keep the identity of their patients private under the controversial law, the law made it a requirement for them to provide “the age and race of the patient, state and country of residence, and [the] number of previous pregnancies, births, and abortions of the patient.” Additionally, the legislation mandated that they include “the gestational age of the unborn baby, [the] abortion method used, and identification of the physician” in their report as well. According to the Planned Parenthood branch, however, the reporting requirements, which many would view as completely sensible, supposedly do not “do enough to protect women’s private medical information from being released to the public.” and should, therefore, not be allowed. The abortion activists also purportedly sued the state over the law because they consider it to be “convoluted” and worry that it “puts health care providers at risk of criminal and civil penalties if they guess wrong when attempting to follow the vague reporting requirements.” To many, however, the law doesn’t appear to endanger the privacy of others or punish those who do their job properly. Instead, it simply helps to protect and inform women who may be thinking about ending the life of their unborn baby. And several months before that, US District Judge Carlton Reeves made it much easier for women to slaughter fetuses while they’re still in the womb by placing a “temporary restraining order” on a piece of pro-life legislation that largely bans women from aborting their child after 15 weeks. Prior to that, US District Court Judge Lee Yeakel struck down a Texas law barring doctors from performing dismemberment abortions. Alarmingly, in addition to Judge Yeakel, US District Judge Myron Thompson struck down a similar law in Alabama around the same time. Without a doubt, many conservatives would agree that the slaughter of the unborn is absolutely barbaric and that defunding Planned Parenthood would be a huge step toward putting a complete end to the horrific practice. "
Seattle Rakes In Soda Tax Money As Health Concern Remains,9 AUG 2018,2522,"When places like Seattle or New York City put their noses into what people chose to ingest, the fourth amendment takes a hit and liberty can be said to weep. At least, however, taxing soda drinkers does make everyone healthier, right? According to Fox News, the tax on pop may be a nice to way to fleece money from people with junk food habits, but the city was unable to determine any noticeable health benefit from the burden. While there has been no reported drop in sugar diabetes or other diseases associated with this soda tariff, Seattle, Washington, “collected more than $10 million from its tax on sugar-sweetened beverages” by reaching into everyone’s pocket and posing as a nanny. Now the city is excited that even more money than hoped for may pour in, but if so, isn’t that showing that they are not changing its citizens’ buying habits? It helped the city’s bank account, but apparently, not its residents’ well-being. It just made them poorer. In fact, it could be argued that they are taxing the poor, the likeliest claim group to be drinking the cheap (and admittedly unhealthy) fizzy beverage. That is why a majority of Seattle residents were in favor of the measure while the chicanery was “less popular among black and Asian respondents and people with lower incomes.” As of information given on Tuesday, “the city’s Finance and Administrative Services department had received $5.8 million in second-quarter payments,” admitted spokeswoman Cyndi Wilder. “Together with $4.7 million in first-quarter payments, the tax has raised $10.5 million to date.” The tax, which many people feel is an infringement, “is 1.75 cents per fluid ounce on the distribution of sugary beverages, syrups, and concentrates.” Of course, now that there is money to be made from the sheeple, who knows how high it shall go…or what other things it may be applied to now that the slippery slope has been traveled? It seems clear that this is not about promoting healthy alternatives. If this were truly the motive, the city would likely be more willing to offer vouchers and other incentives to those who buy healthy drinks or sell them. They could work to make a 2-liter of organic unsweetened blueberry juice as cheap as a 2-liter of soda. Yes, this too would be government overreach, but it would prove their honesty. As it stands, the tax appears that it has the goal of raking in the money, as it does nothing to make anyone healthier. Those collecting the cash are surely laughing all the way to the soda fountain about it."
Wendy’s Management Fails To Act On Disturbing Health Code Violation,19 JUN 2018,4902,"More often than one would like to hear do stories occur involving diners finding repulsive items in their food, such as insects or animal body parts. Usually when such occurs, the distributor or restaurant accountable takes responsibility for the mistake and tries to prevent potential customers from learning of the incident. A Wendy’s employee recently witnessed a disgusting discovery while at work which the store’s managers did not take seriously. Repulsed and tired of being ignored, the employee took a video of the extreme health code violation which immediately went viral on social media. Skylar Frame was working her shift at a Wendy’s in Catoosa, Oklahoma near Tulsa when one of her coworkers noticed something in a bag of hamburger buns: a live mouse. The mouse was crawling over the buns, leaving feces behind. Horrified, Frame alerted management which took no urgency in addressing the situation. They brushed off Frame’s observation saying, “Yeah, we’ll get to it; it’s not really that bad of an issue.” Reportedly, about an hour later, a manager finally relocated the infested bag and “put it in her office instead of taking it outside.” However, Frame understandably considered a live mouse amongst food to be a served to customers a significant problem and acted accordingly. She recorded a video of the mouse crawling in the bag and posted it to her Facebook account alongside a photo of a cigarette on a food preparation surface with the caption “Don’t eat at Wendy’s in Catoosa.” Fellow users were also horrified, with some indicating that they will no longer eat at Wendy’s. Yet while the mouse was still in the store, a woman who saw Frame’s post called the store inquiring as to if there was still a live infestation. Frame reported observing a manager known as ‘Lilian’ deny the allegations. However, Frame noted that this is not the first time she or other employees have seen rodents in the store eating hamburger buns. Another worker also had footage on his phone of a mouse in a bag. While any management team responsible for overseeing food safety should take a mouse sighting seriously, whether alive or dead, managers at the Oklahoma location demonstrated that they do not take such disgusting violations seriously. Other employees noted that management knew of the mice infestation at the franchise location. Apparently, the store has previously been found guilty of other offenses such as the cigarettes on food counters “and workers not using gloves when handling food.” Another employee, Samantha Niebelink, noted that on one occasion, she observed a worker rubbing his nose in between constructing sandwiches. He was both working while ill and also failed to wear gloves. It was reportedly a busy evening when the mouse was discovered. Given management’s previously demonstrated neglect, members of the team would have surely still served the contaminated hamburger buns had Frame nor other employees heard about the mouse and raised concern. Realizing this, Frame rightfully advised the Wendy’s corporation that the mice infestation should be addressed, even if it required closing “down the store for a day.” Her reasoning was never to get the managers in trouble but was simply to advise the local community what they may be eating if they dine at their local Wendy’s. “My friends go there. My family goes there,” she said of the store. “I’m personally just not comfortable with feeding people buns that have been touched by mice.” Such a conscientious attitude regarding food that others are to eat is commendable of Frame and shows that she has better management skills than those above her. However, she reported fearing that she would be fired for exposing the restaurant for the disgusting environment that it apparently is. While she may have ruined relations with local management, the corporate department did not punish Frame and noted “taking this matter very seriously.” It even heeded her advice to have the store inspected for any other health code infractions. In a likely temporary attempt to make store appear presentable, managers ensured that the location passed a health inspection on June 15, which surprisingly revealed no violations. However, Frame revealed a disturbing detail following the inspection: that the store has continued to serve mice feces-infested burger buns as the rodents continue to arise. This is telling of the Wendy’s corporation which is neglecting to hold the store accountable if there are still mice at the Oklahoma location. Upper management can also be blamed for hiring individuals with no apparent concern for preventing illness. Had management dealt with the mice problem in a timely manner, Frame would not have been compelled to post the disgusting video which is sure to affect the restaurant’s success. Yet that can only be blamed on incompetent management which is treating the mice like guests of honor."
Canadian Socialist Health Care Sets New Record,11 JUN 2018,5443,"When leftists in the United States try to pitch a single-payer healthcare system, they tend to talk about Canada’s system as some sort of model of how wondrous such a thing could be. According to them, it’s efficient, it’s ‘cost-effective,’ and it keeps Canadians healthy. The truth is that leftists tend to gloss over most of the negative aspects of Canadian health care. One of the big negatives, and one that the media seems in a hurry to ignore recently, is that record numbers of people in Canada have to wait for care. In fact, the country set numerous records concerning waits for care, stunning onlookers and observers. This is what happens when the government seizes control of such an important portion of the economy. A new report by the Frasier Institute, a Canadian think-tank based in Vancouver, showcased that not only do Canada’s absurdly long wait times for healthcare procedures cause discomfort and pain; they also waste money. According to the fine folks at the Frasier Institute, over a million people had to wait for health care last year. That’s an all-time record for Canada, and not one that they should be excited to set. Worse still, the time wasted waiting for treatment cost the nation’s citizens to lose $1.9 billion in lost wages. In other words, each of those million people, on average, lost about $1,800 waiting for health care. Depending on what they do for a living and how much they earn, that can be as much as an entire month’s take-home salary for some Canadian citizens. Around the world, single-payer systems tend to have much longer wait times than those that are not government-operated. England, for example, has constantly been in the news due to such issues with their National Health Service. One family was recently forbidden to leave the country to seek alternate healthcare after their son was deemed too much of a burden on the system and told he must die. It’s strange to see that democrats and their political allies, such as Bernie Sanders, who attempted to defeat Hillary Clinton in the democrat primary, wish to emulate systems that have such long wait times and death rates. Indeed, Sanders admitted that his own ‘Medicare For All’ bill was modeled after Canada’s own health system. He went on a ‘fact-finding’ trip to investigate their health system in 2017, and while he was there he praised the nation for “guaranteeing” health care for all of its citizens, suggesting that the United States could learn a lot from them. However, all that Canada really guarantees is a spot languishing on a waiting list. According to the Frasier Institute’s report, in 2017, more than 173,000 citizens had to wait on an ophthalmology procedure in the nation. Around 91,000 had to wait in line for some sort of surgical procedure, and 40,000 had to wait for a urology procedure. All told, a whopping three percent of the country was waiting for a medical procedure at the end of 2017. After receiving a referral from a general practitioner in Canada, the average citizen had to wait 21 weeks for treatment from a specialist. For those living in rural areas, the numbers are even worse. A citizen needing an orthopedic surgery waited almost 24 weeks, on average, to see a specialist. A typical patient in the more rural Canadian province of Nova Scotia, on the other hand, waited nearly 39 weeks for the same procedure. In one specific instance, a citizen named Judy Congdon was told that she needed a hip replacement in 2016. According to reporting by the Toronto Sun, doctors scheduled the procedure for September, 2017, for the Ontario resident. However, the hospital ran over budget, and there wasn’t enough money to cover the procedure. Physicians then rescheduled the procedure for 2018. According to the Frasier Institute, the value of all the lost time, not just wages, for people who had to wait on procedures, came out to around $5,600 per patient, or about $5.8 billion over the course of the year. That number doesn’t include the money lost or wasted by family members and friends who had to act as de facto caregivers, either. Single-payer systems have to keep their costs under control somehow. To do this, they set a cap on how much money they will provide to any particular hospital. That means the hospital is limited in how much staff it can hire, how much it can pay staff, and how much equipment it can buy in a given year. When they run out of equipment for procedures, or they’re not able to find staff to cover certain procedures, they end up having to cancel and reschedule care that people need. The United Kingdom’s NHS doesn’t do any better, either. According to doctors in the system, hospitals are so overcrowded that it isn’t uncommon to perform procedures in hallways. The government-run system had to cancel tens of thousands of surgeries, including necessary surgeries related to things like cancer, due to shortages of resources. Americans don’t often hear of similar issues in the United States. In fact, the few times that similar stories come out about care in America, they’re usually related to the government-run Department of Veterans Affairs and their medical facilities. Polls in the United States have said that as many as 70 percent of people in the nation are in favor of a single-payer health care system. Maybe the media should be honest in reporting the failings of such systems. However, they won’t. People won’t become slaves if they know the truth."
Veterans To Receive Memorial Day Gift As Senate Reviews Healthcare Bill,18 MAY 2018,5231,"One of the most horrifying liberal priorities is the left’s willingness to assist non-Americans such as illegals aliens and refugees when there is a devastating number of citizens who truly need help. Veterans are of particular concern considering that these men and women have risked their lives for the country, yet upon returning, many end up homeless or unable to access medical care. In the spirit of Memorial Day, the Senate is expected to sign a bill titled the VA Mission Act to expand veteran medical coverage by allowing vets to see doctors outside the VA healthcare system when necessary, thus shortening the time that it takes to obtain care, which will surely save lives. It will give vets a choice in the doctors they see, as it should be, making many wonder why anyone would demand that veterans give up their ability to consult a private physician. On Thursday, Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnel announced that “the House passed [the] legislation on Wednesday” with a 347 to 70 vote, and it will now be sent to the Senate and then to President Donald Trump, who, of course, fully supports it. President Trump even urged the Senate to sign the bill in a timely manner or at least before Memorial Day, as reported by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who said that current veteran healthcare concerns often accompany “never-ending lines.” Under the proposed law, veterans may see their own private-sector doctors when there are realistic geographical or time concerns. Such circumstances include when the nearest VA medical center is over 40 minutes away, when a vet is unable to see a doctor within 30 days, “or when care is determined inadequate by VA leaders.” This is a common problem for veterans who live in rural areas, those without reliable transportation, and those who have difficulty traveling such distances due to their age. The new measure will cause $52 billion, with $5.2 billion of which will “avoid a shutdown of the [Veteran] Choice Program which is expected to run out of funds as early as May 31.” While this may seem steep, it is arguably justifiable given that healthcare is the minimum that veterans should expect after dutifully serving their country. To not invest such funding in American veterans especially pertaining to the Choice program would almost guarantee that many veterans would have healthcare needs delayed which may result in deaths from not receiving health services in a timely manner. The Choice program was originally created as a result of such tragedies due to flaws in the system. While the bill will require significant funding, it will actively “ensure resources aren’t wasted on unused and underutilized facilities,” thus redistributing funds where they are most needed. After announcing that the House passed the bill, McConnell noted that this new law would result in “significant reforms to the Department of Veteran Affairs which will increase and strengthen the healthcare and community care options available to America’s veterans.” As expected, House democrats with no regard for the well-being of America’s bravest opposed the bill based on the possibility that “the VA is headed toward privatization which would remove many responsibilities from the VA system and provide public funding to private medical centers.” While that is admittedly possible, the current state of Veteran Affairs is currently failing vets in need. It should not be of anyone’s concern if a vet requiring medical attention seeks private care if they determine it to be more suitable for them. The main opponent was Minnesota Representative Tim Walz who has reportedly been against VA reformation efforts for years. However, some democrats did support the bill, including Montana Senator Jon Tester of the Veterans Affairs Committee. Tennessee Representative Phil Roe, a republican, called the bill a “promise kept to our veterans,” and 40 other “veterans service organizations” supported the legislation including Concerned Veterans for America which pleaded senators to sign the bill as soon as possible to avoid the VA “run[ning] out of funding at the end of the month.” Despite 70 representatives voting against it, Roe celebrated the victory by calling the House passing the Mission Act a “once in a lifetime transformational bill.” The organization’s executive director, Dan Caldwell, continued that every time legislation regarding veteran healthcare is delayed, vets suffer from “substandard care and unacceptable wait times.” Considering that there are many physical and mental concern which veterans face after serving the country, it is inexcusable that the VA reached a point that it barely can meet vets’ needs. Under current U.S. healthcare policies, veterans have a significantly harder time obtaining necessary care when it appears to be virtually effortless for illegals, criminals, and those who do not work and live off government funding. This is horrifically disrespectful for those who have served and even more so for service personnel who did not return home. Thankfully, President Trump and the House and Senate are working to pass legislation which symbolically expresses sincere gratitude for U.S. veterans and ensures that they are properly taken care of."
Man Exercising Carry Rights Has Gun Seized Over ‘Mental Health’ Concerns,17 MAY 2018,5111,"When applied to a legally appropriate place, the term ‘open carry’ means exactly that. The only exception, it appears, is when liberals are overly offended by law-abiding citizens exercising such a right. This was the exact situation for a Pennsylvania man from the Abington Township who boldly sported an AR-15: the most dreaded and attacked weapon in the recent gun grabbing liberal agenda. Even more ridiculously, the citizen in question had his firearm seized and it allegedly “will not be returned” under mental health concerns which unconstitutionally bypasses due process. Supposedly, the man in question had been carrying conspicuously large guns in his version of supporting second amendment rights. The man who has remained unnamed was obviously not arrested, because he did not in any way violate the law. However, neighbors who knew the suspect reported that he was a suspicious character and had made reputable threats. While this appears to be typical neighborhood feuding, it is a reality in several parts of the country where overreaching state laws have subsequently taken away citizens’ right on the basis of them simply appearing dangerous. Such laws are designed to keep the people safe, however, local governments can be admittedly harmful to those seeking protection. In some states, extreme risk protection orders can be mandated, and, in many cases, do the unthinkable: bypass American citizens’ rights. This type of legislation can manifest in various laws depending on the state. However, even in liberal territories, this admittedly crosses constitutional boundaries. Under the Mental Health Procedures Act and the Uniform Firearms Act in Pennsylvania, the citizen in question had his right to bear arms immediately stripped without the slightest regard for due process. The organization’s claim in doing such bypassed both second and fifth amendment protocols, making it highly unconstitutional on several levels. However, the organization claims that it did such on the basis of individuals who have “require[ed] inpatient care [and] may not possess or purchase firearms.” Naturally, this is where the ‘what if’ factor is relevant. In the case of the Pennsylvania man, he apparently had several reports of him engaging in ‘suspicious’ activity that did not support his argument, but they all still remain speculative in nature. Liberally imposed firearm bans are generally ridiculous, however, mental health statuses must be taken into consideration when appropriate. This appears to be the case with the Pennsylvania gun owner who was questioned on the basis of his ‘odd’ behavior. However, whether the average civilian likes it or not, every U.S. citizen has the right to own a gun or any other legally obtained weapon. The threat, of course, lies in how such power is implemented. In legal constitutional carry states, for example, every person could be carrying; however, it is the concept of one person openly and responsibly possessing a weapon which apparently frightens sensitive liberals. In Pennsylvania, the authorities who arrested the man carrying the AR-15 seemingly only considered this and ridiculously mandated that the man be subjected to mental health evaluation. Of course, as most recently seen in the Parkland, Florida school shooting, mental health is a significant issue pertaining to the gun control argument and more importantly, violence in general. However, as has been seen in all too many cases of gun-grabbing liberal control, those opposing personal protection are generally in full support of laws such as extreme orders of protection which can be mandated by anyone in states as California and New York. According to reports, despite passing such psychiatric evaluations, the Pennsylvania man was told that he should not expect his weapons returned any time soon. Under the ridiculous ‘health’ act, the individual in question may be mandated counseling and other programs of rehabilitation which may arguably not be necessary. In any case, there remains an extremely fine line regarding what may be a legitimate mental health concern and that that is simply neighborhood paranoia. The obvious danger in allowing seemingly anybody from issuing a protective order is that even the most law-abiding citizen could have his rights attacked. Recently, a female college graduate posted photos of herself on her Twitter account where she was open carrying an AR-10 on her college campus in opposition to a rule which allowed visitors to carry on the university campus but not students, professors, or staff. Consistent with ridiculous liberal logic, she was immediately harassed, as was seen in the case of the Pennsylvania man. Of course, as mentioned, any individual who has been determined to be unfit to responsibly bear arms should not. However, the extent that this concern has been addressed has been overly excessive especially recently. While liberals may lead others to believe that the second amendment is up for negotiation, it is not, and any concerns regarding such must be taken seriously through due process considerations for all citizens."
"Texas Doctor Indicted In massive Healthcare Fraud, Treatment Scam",16 MAY 2018,4772,"Few things are as frightful as awaiting a diagnosis from a doctor. Even worse, however, is when the doctor is greedy, dishonest, and possibly a danger the patient’s health. MSN News has confirmed today that that was the case with Dr. Jorge Zamora-Quezada of McAllen, Texas. He has been indicted for a health care fraud scheme netting over $240 million. Roughly five years ago, Maria Zapata went to Dr. Quezada for problems in one of her knees. The rheumatologist informed his patient that she had arthritis and gave her injections “to strengthen the cartilage.” When Mr. Zapata asked “Why are you giving her so many injections?” the doctor promised that it would help. But, he lied. About all of it. The 70-year gained no ease from her symptoms and felt that the shots were actually making the knee worse. When her leg began to look discolored, other doctors began to wonder about what Quezada was doing, too. This only proved to be more of a concern when the patient’s family doctor said that he felt that Mrs. Zapata did not have arthritis. Now, “a joint federal and local investigation” has found that she is not the only patient to have gone through procedures that were not needed. The crooked doctor used “fraudulent statements” that raked in $50 million dollars for himself (his Private jet and Maserati). Dr. Quezada sent fake claims “to health care benefit programs,” according to reports. On Facebook and elsewhere in the community, those treated “at his Brownsville, Edinburg and San Antonio clinics” were alarmed by the news as it broke. The horror is much worse than just a case of greed and a few shots. The Department of Justice has found that “the rheumatologist had given patients chemotherapy and toxic treatments they didn’t need” simply to pay for his “lavish” and “opulent lifestyle.” Chemotherapy alone ravages the body and is something that, if not needed, can lead to a person getting cancer if they don’t already have it. “Today’s indictment is the first step in holding Dr. Zamora-Quezada accountable for his allegedly egregious criminal conduct,” declared C.J. Porter of the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General‘s Dallas Region. He also said, “His patients trusted him and presumed his integrity; in return, he allegedly engaged in a scheme of false diagnoses and bogus courses of treatment and doled out prescriptions for unnecessary and harmful medications, all for his personal financial gain and with no regard for patient well-being.” CDN News has learned that the 61-year-old is “no stranger to the courts” and TMB News found that the Texas Medical Board has reprimanded the physician in the past. As of Monday, Quezada stands “accused of falsely diagnosing patients with various degenerative diseases including rheumatoid arthritis.” Not only that, but the dishonest man is also “charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, five counts of health care fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.” Nora Rodriguez, a 44-year-old patient of the doctors, remembered the time that she was thrown out of the office for simply asking why the plethora of medications that he prescribed did her no good. “He kept getting upset when I was asking him why I was feeling worse and not getting better,” recalled the patient who was likely being poisoned. “He yelled and told me, ‘you are no longer my patient; get out of this office.’ I’m getting chills remembering this,” Rodriguez added. When those who Quezada had treated wanted their medical records, it is known that the greedy man would “conceal patient records from other rheumatologists,” the indictment reads. He would also “hide those records from Medicare in an insecure and dilapidated building in the Rio Grande Valley,” a fact revealed as photos show medical records just tossed to the floor at that location. “Honestly, we didn’t know that was going on there,” lamented a doctor who used to refer patients to Quezada. Dr. Magdalena Caudillo of Peñitas, Texas, also stated, “He would never deny any of our patients, even if we knew there was no major diagnosis.” Now the reason for that quirk is quite clear. Even without “consult notes,” the foul doctors would prescribe the same medications.  “I didn’t think there was anything seriously wrong with you,” Caudillo would often say to those under Quezada’s care. “This isn’t going to work. This isn’t stuff that you need.” Similarly, Roselie Ibarra, now aged 19, was diagnosed with arthritis and it turns out that she, too, likely never had it. The list of those abused or mistreated by the nefarious man seem almost endless. Thankfully, he won’t be doing this to anyone else and where he is likely headed, he won’t be living his “lavish lifestyle” anymore, either."
Bolton Dissolves Global Health Team Amid Ebola Outbreak,11 MAY 2018,5812,"The exact same day a new outbreak of Ebola was reported, the highest ranking global health security official suddenly announced he was quitting. Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer resigned his post with the National Security Council on Tuesday. His supervisor, John Bolton, told the remaining staff of Ziemer’s global health security team to prepare for new assignments, dissolving what was left of the already shrunken unit. This morning, the first officially confirmed recent Ebola death in the Democratic Republic of Congo was announced as the number of cases doubled overnight. Eighteen suspected deaths have so far occurred. The case count went from 14 known or suspected Ebola cases yesterday to 32 today. Three of those cases are health workers and a nurse was one of the ones who died. Nothing can be worse than the “stick your head in the sand” strategy used by the Obama administration the last time an Ebola plague happened. Now is a perfect opportunity to overhaul the badly flawed system and rebuild the U.S. response strategy from the ground up. But, we have to do it quickly. John Bolton served as an Ambassador to the United Nations and generally worked in conservative politics. He was recently appointed by President Trump as national security adviser to replace laterally shuffled H.R. McMaster. As soon as he started the new position, Bolton “purged” his department, planning to reorganize things to run better. That included the removal of Tom Bossert for incompetence. Bossert fell for a “spear-phishing” attack, tricked into thinking the hacker was Jared Kushner. One of Bolton’s plans is to consolidate the NSC with the Homeland Security Council (HSC) to avoid duplication of effort. He didn’t see Ebola immediately on the horizon in his crystal ball, so the timing of the shakeup is rather inconvenient. The latest developments this week mean that there aren’t any officials specifically in charge of directing a global health security response to the hemorrhagic fever flare up. The Trump administration “remains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure,” NSC spokesman Robert Palladino insists. For now, the virus is contained in the Congo and help is on the way. There is still time to get it under control before it gets to the U.S. again. Starting in 2014, it became frighteningly apparent that medical staff and government agencies were equally incompetent at identifying and isolating Ebola cases, and dealing with the repercussions. By 2015, the sheer number of screw-ups had the public panicking. Obama’s media minions simply stopped covering the whole subject. Referring to the way that coverage suddenly fell off dramatically, one writer notes, “that is especially true in the United States… one mainstream news channel – CNN – may actually be covering up some important details.” Nobody was ever able to sufficiently explain how two nurses, garbed in hazmat gear, were able to get Ebola in a Dallas, Texas, hospital. Nina Pham and Amber Vinson both treated Thomas Eric Duncan. Their patient had not been immediately isolated and neither nurse had any hands-on training. The hazardous waste continued to pile up in the hospital because nobody had the permits necessary to transport the contaminated waste. There wasn’t anywhere to take it if they did. Medical Staff weren’t even prepared to spot the symptoms of Ebola. Duncan was sent home from the hospital fully contagious long before the blood tests came back. By then, an entire apartment building had to be quarantined and decontaminated. Nina Pham left the state to attend a wedding. She had the disease as she boarded the plane for Ohio. The bridal shop who served the party went out of business from simply not being able to decontaminate what she carelessly spread into their store. Hundreds could have been infected. When an American doctor treating Liberian patients succumbed to the disease, he was airlifted, along with his equally ill nurse, to Atlanta, Georgia for treatment. Even with three days notice, the staff was unprepared for their arrival. “With two Ebola patients on the way, it quickly became clear that Emory’s specially trained team was too small,” the hospital’s chief of nursing Nancye Feistritzer relates. All of the most recent illnesses are confined for now to an isolated area in DRC’s Equateur province. The affected Bikoro health zone has a population of around 163,000 people with 3 hospitals and 19 poorly funded clinics with limited services. The biggest concern for health officials right now is restricting travel along the Congo River. The disease “hot spot” is connected by the waterway to capital cities in the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. The World Health Organization’s head of emergency response, Peter Salama, explains that WHO is “especially concerned” about the spread of the disease to Mbandaka, the nearest large city, only a few hours away. “If we see a town of that size infected with Ebola, then we are going to have a major urban outbreak,” he warned. WHO is ramping up for “the worst case scenario,” just in case. “Access is extremely difficult,” Salama notes. The organization already has a team on the ground “and is preparing to send up to 40 more specialists in epidemiology, logistics, contact tracing and other areas to the region in the coming week or so.” The United Nations will also be setting up a mobile lab over the weekend. The response “is going to be extremely challenging, and very costly,” Salama warns. One thing different this time from the 2014 outbreak. “The WHO is also awaiting a green light from DRC authorities to begin a vaccination campaign in the area, using an available stockpile of an experimental vaccine.”"
"Planned Parenthood Files Lawsuit To Prevent Mandated Health Inspections, Claims ‘Unconstitutional’",25 APR 2018,5767,"The horrors that occur at Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics are disturbing beyond comprehension. Thankfully, however, the chain is still considered a ‘healthcare’ organization and is thus required to pass routine inspections to ensure the safety of its patients. Yet for unknown reasons, those on behalf of the murderous organization feel that it should be above such inspections and have recently filed a lawsuit claiming that “intrusive requirements” are unconstitutional and ‘shameful’ in nature despite many Planned Parenthood locations having failed to uphold even the most basic requirements for safety and sterility standards. Unsurprisingly, this lawsuit was filed in Indiana. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana is defending the abortion chain throughout Indiana and Kentucky and on Monday formally filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana in response to a law which requires abortion clinics to undergo annual inspections and “requires medical providers who treat women for complications due to abortion procedures to report patient information to the state.” While the law is only to protect the well-being of all Planned Parenthood patients, Jane Henegar on behalf of the ACLU of Indiana has claimed that “once again Indiana politicians are barging in the exam room with irrational demands and intrusive requirements.” Planned Parenthood defended itself by claiming that abortion complications “are both extremely rare…and are more likely to occur after other medical procedures.” Of course, this is simply another one of the lies which Planned Parenthood continues to claim in order to retain the support of liberal feminists. Even more disturbing, while Planned Parenthood does offer non-abortion services such as contraception and STD testing, it has been reported that such services “have been in decline in recent years,” so the chain has undeniably centered its profits around abortion services. The CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Christie Gillespie, however, argued that the Indiana law “is not about patient safety,” irrationally claiming that “abortion ‘is already incredibly safe.’” She claims that the safety regulations were designed with the sole purpose of “sham[ing] and stigmatiz[ing] pregnant” women in Indiana as well as “spread[ing] the myth that abortion is dangerous.” However, it is important to note that not only are chemical and surgical abortions highly dangerous to women, many abortionists have been found guilty of participating in illegal and immoral practices. Most notably, in 2013, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania doctor, Kermit Gosnell was discovered to have killed countless babies who were born alive yet were supposed to be aborted. In one instance, one of Gosnell’s previously pregnant patients even died from a botched procedure. At the time when Americans United for Life released the 200-page report outlining the mentioned crimes, the current vice president, Denise Burke, claimed that the Pennsylvania nightmares were only the “tip of the iceberg” in revealing horrific findings regarding the abortion industry. Burke continued that Planned Parenthood appears to only care about providing “access to abortion” than it does in ensuring that women who choose abortion are safe from undeniable risks associated with the procedure. Considering that abortion is a highly controversial subject, it is of utmost necessity that it be regulated to protect pro-choice women. However, the recent ACLU and Planned Parenthood lawsuit is said to be “sadly predictable” according to Mike Fichter, “president and CEO of Indiana Right to Life.” He continues that whenever conservative lawmakers attempt to implement laws which have women’s health interests in mind, liberals fight to have them overturned, most specifically with Planned Parenthood, “the abortion giant, run[ning] to activist judges to block the laws.” However, it should be noted that the Indiana law, along with others which seek to “bring needed transparency to the abortion industry” are not even openly fighting against the practice of abortion but are simply attempting to keep liberal women safe from often crooked doctors. Yet this has proven to be yet another lie that Planned Parenthood is preaching, claiming that the law’s requirements “clearly violate well-established Supreme Court precedent holding[s] that a woman may terminate her pregnancy.” Unfortunately, this is likely in response to the recently overturned Indiana law which would have mandated that an unborn child cannot be terminated due to his or her “disability, race, or sex.” Since no such protection currently exists, expectant mothers can have their children aborted for classifications such as being female, African American, or having down syndrome. While that was a devastating ruling, conservatives in Indiana and other states will surely fight for similar legislation that babies from all backgrounds have the right to live outside of the womb. Yet even more concerning regarding the clinic inspection law, many Planned Parenthoods have failed to pass such requirements that ensure they are running safe and clean clinics. In Missouri, a Planned Parenthood location applied for abortion licensing but was thankfully denied on the basis that it was found to have been exposing patients to highly dangerous environments such as rusty tools, expired medicine, and workers who had been failing to wash their hands between patients. This is a frightening reality for all potential Planned Parenthood patients, yet such violations could occur at any other location. For this reason, it is not unreasonable for Indiana or other states to mandate that abortion clinics be properly inspected to ensure that patients are not in imminent danger."
"Refugees Sue Socialized Healthcare After Starving Son, Win Millions",16 APR 2018,4904,"Even someone without formal training can understand a few basics about taking care of a newborn. The newborn needs cleanliness, food, water, love, attention, affection. These are basic needs… and babies will explain when they are hungry. Mothers around the world understand that without being told. However, apparently the National Health Service is somehow liable because it didn’t properly inform two immigrant parents that their child, like literally every other living organism on Earth, needed food. Midwives apparently failed to explain in a way that crossed the ‘language barrier,’ that the refugees needed to feed their child, and now the family is going to win millions from the National Health Service (NHS) in litigation. The Rajathapeen family came to England as refugees from Sri Lanka, a small third-world nation off the coast of India. The family came to England during the Sri Lankan Civil War, a long-term conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the ‘Tamil Tigers,’ and gave birth to a son, Nilujan,  at King George Hospital in Essex in July 2009. They were welcomed, and given taxpayer healthcare. The child was born healthy and with no major health issues in July 2009. However, nurses visited the family next day and found that his parents failed to feed him for 15 hours, leaving Nilujan left limp and sick. According to the decision in the case, Mrs. Rajathapeen and her son, Nilujan, were discharged from the hospital too soon. The nurses rushed Nilujan back to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with brain damage as a result of his parents’ failure to feed him. Now, seven years later, he suffers from cerebral palsy, as well as severe mental and physical disabilities. Judge Martin McKenna decided in favor of the parents, saying that the National Health Service failed to render them the appropriate care. He claimed that when medics visited Nilujan at home a day after he was released, the parents were “effectively ignored” when the medics noticed that the child was in terrible health and looked unwell. They also were not ‘properly’ instructed in the importance of taking care of their child, including feeding him. Because Mrs. Rajathapeen and her husband, Sivarajah Rajathapeen, barely speak English, the judge deemed that they were not properly given instructions on taking care of their child by the midwives. The midwives disagree, and say that they have given instructions to many other people who do not understand English without similar issues arising. Due to the ‘failures’ of the midwives and the hospital that delivered the child, the refugees won a civil lawsuit against the King George Hospital in Essex. The only question now is how much money they will receive. The judge suggests that the amount of money the family receives could be well into seven figures, and that the compensation awarded will take into account a number of factors, including the long-term nature of the ‘damage’ caused by the failure to properly explain to the Rajathapeens that they had to feed their child. The National Health Service is using the incident as a ‘teaching’ experience, hoping to ensure that they will be able to avoid lawsuit and injury to patients in the future. Wendy Matthews, OBE and Director of Midwifery for a number of NHS hospitals, said that they are heeding the judgment in the case. Further, she suggests that although the NHS system has improved since 2009, they will use this time to review the case and see if there are “any more lessons about our post-natal care” that the NHS can learn. Wendy Matthews also extended her sincerest apologies to the Rajathapeens. However, it would be very interesting to see people from Sri Lanka who don’t speak at least basic English. England controlled Sri Lanka, also sometimes called Ceylon, since the early 1800’s. It didn’t earn its independence until nearly 1950. Further, English is a widely-spoken language in Sri Lanka. At least 10 percent of the nation speaks it fluently as the native tongue. It is the language used for most official capacities in the nation, simply because it is a common language that most people understand to some extent in the nation. The Constitution of Sri Lanka even lists English as the nation’s ‘link’ language. England is a nation that has a large immigrant populace. It is hard to believe that the nurses wouldn’t be able to find someone who could translate, or that they would not be able to find someone who could help explain with hand motions. Furthermore, people have understood the basics of feeding their children for millennia. It seems absurd that some organization would be liable for teaching a new mother to do so, or that she could sue the entity that paid for the birth her child because she didn’t understand one of the most basic tenets of childcare. But apparently, in England, she can, and she’s likely to get millions of pounds for doing so."
"McDonald’s Health Scare, Worker Found To Have Hepatitis A",13 APR 2018,2443,"When people think of the dangers of fast food, they tend to think of deadly GMO’s, fat, sugar, and HFC. It is rare that one’s mind drifts to thoughts of Hepatitis, but as Kentucky (dot com) has confirmed, that is just the worry that was needed on Glades Road in Berea, Kentucky according to the Madison County Health Department. At one McDonald’s location, a “food handler worked while infected with Hepatitis A” and no one had any clue about it. Thankfully, the risk to those who ate there is said to be low, but that’s also what officials tend to say no matter has happened. Just the same, those that dined there “on March 23 should watch for signs and symptoms of Hepatitis A from April 7 to May 12,” just to be on the same side. As irony would have it, this McDonald’s location received a 100% during the last health department inspection only last February! Owner/operator John Faris said that the restaurant is cooperating in every way with health officials on both the local and state level as they “investigate this matter to ensure the health and safety of our employees and guests.” Again pushing how the risk factor is thought to be small (as opposed to mentioning how bad Hepatitis A is), Faris stated, “We have been informed they are investigating a single, isolated case, and the risk to guests who’ve visited our restaurant is very low.” He added, “We are committed to providing a clean and safe environment for all who visit our restaurant and received a 100 percent score on our most recent health inspection.” However, if the worker did not wash his or her hands perfectly after using the restroom due to a busy rush (which is common in food service, sadly) and then touched food or related items, the risk factor goes up. Both food and water can carry and transmit the horrible sickness, too. Worst of all, there is said to be a “string” of hepatitis cases taking place in Kentucky. For example, the Ashland-Boyd County Health Department is looking into a different case of the illness stemming from a local Ken’s Express Mart on April 7. Also, a similar incident of hepatitis is being investigated at two different Waffle House locations. It seems that the problem is far from solved and the most worrisome part is that no one has much power to protect against the threat when food is purchased. That is why a healthy immune system that is kept in tip-top shape is vital. After all, threats even lurk in the drive-thru now."
Small Boy Becomes Center Of Health Debate As Parents Fight For His Life,13 APR 2018,3912,"When “Dr. Death,” Jack Kevorkian, was peddling the “right to die” movement, many feared that the practice of killing costly or very ill patients would be expanded to those who did not wish to perish. As The Sun reported today, that is exactly what is happening in the case of 23-month old Alfie Evans and his parents, Tom Evans and Kate James in England. For months now, the little boy had been at the “centre of a life support battle between his parents, health officials and the British justice system.” Much like the Terri Schiavo, those fighting to keep the tyke alive have found that courts have ruled that his precious life support could be pulled. Even the Pope has chimed in and sided with the unfortunate child. A “mystery illness” put little Evans in a coma and he has been in that state for the last year. The child was born in perfect health yet by 7 months, he had missed many “milestones” of development. He also began to make “jerking, seizure-like movements” and was then taken to the hospital. Once there, the family claims that the medical staff were all but uninterested in the boy’s case and gave the cavalier response that their son was “lazy and a late developer.” Sadly, the small child developed a chest infection “that caused seizures and was placed on life support at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool in December 2016.”  The poor child was in “a semi-vegetative state” and suffers from “a degenerative neurological condition” that doctors can not pinpoint even now. Medical staff told the parents that their boy would not make it, but he beat the infection and began breathing on his own, proving them wrong. Somehow, the younger Evans was allowed to catch another chest infection that caused “more chronic seizures” and ended with him being placed back on a ventilator. Doctors want to pull the plug on the child and the parents feel that this is a travesty. The child has a form of Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS), which is a group of disorders that lead to “a significant drop in mitochondrial DNA.” This affects breathing and the body’s production of energy. The muscles that are needed for Alfie Evan’s to live a normal life, as well as his brain and kidneys, are affected by his MDS. While no cure exists, nucleoside bypass therapy has been found to be effective in treating the symptoms. That is what the parents wish to see happen, but they are being denied. The parents are both in their 20’s and have been imploring the justice system to keep their child alive. This is the very reason why conservatives and libertarians are so terrified of the government getting involved in the medical system. Often, the concerns of the bottom line trump treatment. Experimental treatments are often hampered by the government, even when the patient is dying. The father has quoted the Bible and reminded the courts of the law, “thou shalt not kill,” as he begs for his son’s life. Evans said that the couple is “in bits, distraught, in pain” as their boy is “about to be murdered.” “Failed disgracefully by the system. Does our son look in any of these pictures like he is dying!!!!!” charged the outraged father. “We as parents are not giving up … Our son is about to be murdered, taking [sic] away from us, his innocent life is about to be taken.” The Pope tweeted and said, “It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard. I am praying for Alfie, for his family and for all who are involved.” With the money that the Vatican has, it seems feasible that the child could be moved and cared for there, but no mention of this has taken place. This is where socialized medicine takes a nation and this is what happens when the cost of care becomes more valuable than human life. No one feels this more acutely than the Evans family."
Investigation Finds 80% Of Public Housing Has At Least One “Severe” Health Risk,4 APR 2018,2622,"When President Donald Trump was on the campaign trail, he often spoke about America as if it were a third-world nation. While some would mock the U.S. leader for this, all laughter will cease when facts obtained in the New York Post today are more fully understood. They have found that over “80 percent of NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) units examined by state inspectors had at least one” problem that was viewed as a “severe” risk to health. The New York City Health Department confirmed these findings in a new report that has many in the area very unhappy. All told, 212 out of 255 units proved a real problem. This is housing that is supposed to be helping the city’s neediest population and is instead making their lives worse. The department looked at 255 dwellings, so it was not a small number that skewed the results. It was revealed that no less than 212 of the units suffered “at least one severe condition” which the state says “could pose a health hazard” to those staying at the residences. Repairs have gotten so expensive, taxes have soared so very high, that fewer people than ever can afford to repair or maintain things properly. As President Trump has said, the very nation is crumbling, and he was not exaggerating. Authorities found “peeling paint, mold, damaged plaster, rodents, insects, inoperable appliances, and malfunctioning smoke detectors” at many of the homes in New York. Furthermore, seventeen of the properties inspected “had both a nonworking stove and a busted refrigerator.” In 22 others, at least one of the two were not working. Adding to the festering problem is the fact that “insect infestations in 121 out of 255 units, or 47.4 percent.” With bedbugs making a comeback not seen since the days of silent movies, one cringes to imagine what was found. Bugs of some kind were a problem in half of the homes tested, after all. America is to be a shining city on a hill. When did Americans lose focus of that? Wages have gone done, it is in the papers every day, perhaps so often that it is forgotten. Sadly, these sorts of problems are not just issues with no fallout. Rather, it is seen as the land and homes that many have worked for their whole lives is overrun. Dilapidation follows, and that is rot that is being seen now in New York City. Landlords who do not wish to be slumlords end up being so due to these high costs. If they raise the price of rent, units sit dormant, so the problem only worsens since the taxes are still due. These are circumstances that need to change if the U.S. is to recover and again be what so many know that it is capable of becoming."
"New “Challenge” Consumes Teens, Experts Point Out Obvious Health Risks",3 APR 2018,2485,"A man with tattoos is seen on a video, snorting a condom up his nose and pulling it out of his mouth. Suddenly, while everyone is expecting a young teen from 2018, the VCR recording shows a time stamp of 1994. The performer is “The Enigma,” and contrary to what is being thought on social media, this trick is as old as alternative radio and Lollapalooza tours (where The Engima cut his teeth in 1994). Don’t tell that to any of the teens reported in a recent Daily Caller article, though. They think that the fad is something new! Much safer than eating Tide Pods or burning themselves on hot stoves for fun, snorting prophylactics is the new rage on social media.  Fox News has found that “sticking a condom up their nostrils, inhaling it then pulling it out from their throats” is the latest waste of time kids are engaging it. If this is our future, God help America. This will prove harmless until some idiot chokes to death or is allergic to latex. Then, things will get quite interesting. Cries of “ban the condom” will be heard as soon as it happens. Bruce Y. Lee, “an associate professor of international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health” has found that the spermicide found on some sexual safety aids can also pose a risk, although anyone recovering from Tide Pod ingestion shouldn’t mind them too much. Summing the whole fad up wonderfully, Lee said that completing this condom challenge would “demonstrate to everyone that you have absolutely no proper judgment.” Considering that the “The Enigma” is a professional performer (who likely knows if he is allergic to latex or what is on the condom going up his nose) this would seem logical. Lee also added, “Even if you manage to successfully pull the condom out through your mouth, inhaling a condom up your nose would be very uncomfortable and potentially quite painful.” Parents and guardians will be up in arms worrying about this for weeks, all the way until the next fad happens. Still, the concern should not be that kids do such things, for so do many adults. Rather, the larger concern is that everyone now lives in a world where, between using the internet to find porn or post photos of lunch on Facebook, the trove of knowledge that is the online world consists of condom snorters. While that is certainly always going to be the case, for better or for worse, it would be nice if the “new” fads were not something made famous by a sideshow performer a quarter of a century or longer ago."
UK Health Officials Release Statement As Doctors Fail To Treat “Super-Resistant” Disease,30 MAR 2018,5767,"Just recently, health officials in the United Kingdom (UK) revealed there’s a strain of gonorrhea, which is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world, that is becoming increasingly resistant to treatment. They did so after they treated a man for the disease, which is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using two different antibiotics and he still came back positive. According to a case report from Public Health England (PHE), the unidentified man was given azithromycin and ceftriaxone, which are two antibiotics commonly used to cure it, earlier this month after he developed symptoms following a sexual encounter with a woman in Southeast Asia. Much to the doctors’ surprise, however, when they performed follow-up tests, they found that he was still positive for the disease. They then injected him with ertapenem, which is another antibiotic, but so far that drug also appears to not be working. “This is the first time a case has displayed such high-level resistance to both of these drugs and to most other commonly used antibiotics,” explained Dr. Gwenda Hughes, who leads the sexually transmitted infection section at Public Health England, in a statement about the matter. “We are following up this case to ensure that the infection was effectively treated with other options and the risk of any onward transmission is minimized,” continued Hughes. To clarify, he said, “PHE actively monitors, and acts on, the spread of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea and potential treatment failures, and has introduced enhanced surveillance to identify and manage resistant strains of infection promptly to help reduce further spread.” While speaking to reporters about the report, David Harvey, the executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, struggled to hide his concern. “[It] is one more confirmation of our greatest fear: drug-resistant gonorrhea spreading around the globe,” stated Harvey. “Here in the U.S. and around the globe, we have to take drug-resistant gonorrhea seriously in order to invest in finding new cures and preventing infections,” he added, noting, “working together, funding must be radically increased to combat this and other life-threatening STDs.” Disturbingly, drug-resistant gonorrhea isn’t the only disease health officials are worried about spreading. Several months ago, for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a plague warning for nine countries and territories in and near Africa. This is because there’s apparently a huge outbreak of the deadly disease in Madagascar, where over 120 people have died and roughly 1,000 have been infected. Officials are worried about the possibility of people visiting the huge African island and bringing the disease back home with them. during a recent hearing about the plague outbreak in Madagascar at the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland, a spokesman for the WHO warned about the likelihood of the disease spreading to neighboring countries. “Nine countries and overseas territories have been identified as priority countries in the African region for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of having trade and travel links to Madagascar,” explained a spokesman for the WHO during a recent hearing about the plague outbreak in Madagascar at the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland. “The risk of regional spread is moderate due to the occurrence of frequent travel by air and sea to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries,” he added. According to reports, the nine countries included in the travel warning are Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La Réunion (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania. Despite the terrifying news, Ibrahima Soce Fall, who works as the Regional Emergency Director for Africa for the World Health Organization, believes that they’ll be able to contain the outbreak before it gets too bad. “I‘m confident that with the strong team we have on the ground, combined with more partners coming and health workers, we will be able very quickly to reverse the trend,” mentioned Fall while speaking with reporters about the deadly disease earlier this week. So far, the WHO has delivered roughly 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to help fight the disease. On top of that, the Red Cross has also been training hundreds of volunteers on the island to help publicise preventative measures. Although the reason for the outbreak is still under investigation, officials believe that a centuries-old tradition known as “famadihana,” otherwise known as “the turning of the bones” or “body turning,” may be to blame. It involves family members digging up the bones of their dead relatives, rewrapping them with a fresh cloth, and dancing with the newly wrapped corpses before eventually returning the remains to their graves. Shockingly, Madagascar isn’t the only place where the plague has recently shown up. Last year in Arizona, for instance, numerous fleas tested positive for the bubonic plague, an extremely deadly disease that has killed millions of people throughout history. Specifically, back in 2017, researchers at the Center for Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University found that fleas collected near Red Lake, Arizona, which is in Coconino County, tested positive for Yersinia pestis, a bacteria that causes the bubonic plague. Officials have since treated the area where they were found to try and stop the disease from spreading and are still closely monitoring the situation. Without a doubt, the report released by the PHE is extremely disturbing. Hopefully, researchers are able to come up with a cure for the new strain in the very near future before too many people are harmed."
"Health Department Reveals CA Signed Up 450,000 For Medicaid Who Aren’t Eligible",28 MAR 2018,4776,"California is a state that has tremendous numbers of citizens on various entitlement programs, mostly at the expense of the federal taxpayer, rather than the state. Indeed, California consumes a lot of welfare money; recent studies from California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) state that they spend at least $375.8 BILLION dollars a year in federal money on welfare in the state, or about $10,000 for every person living in the state. A recent report suggests that a lot of money spent in California is wasted on people who are ineligible for benefits. In fact, the DHS suggests that California signed up an estimated 450,000 for Medicaid who are not eligible for benefits, at a cost of more than $1.15 BILLION dollars. The report, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that the state spent nearly $750 million on 366,000 Medicaid recipients who weren’t eligible for services. These recipients were ‘expansion beneficiaries,’ receiving ‘expanded’ benefits from the government. The HHS inspector general determined that all these people were ineligible, without question, for Medicaid. An additional 79,000 expansion beneficiaries were ‘potentially’ ineligible, according to HHS auditors. California spent $416.5 million on those potentially ineligible beneficiaries, or about $5,000 per person. According to federal investigators, it was the federal government that footed most of the $1.15 billion in funding for ineligible and potentially ineligible individuals, accounting for 90% of the money spent. That means California wasted $1.035 BILLION in federal funding on these ineligible individuals, while the state spent around $115 million from their state-level program, Medi-Cal. The study, performed by the HHS and published in the end of February 2018, extrapolated results from a sample of 150 beneficiaries, and the authors reported a 90% confidence rate in their findings. All this means that the number of ineligible recipients could be as low as 260,000, or it could be as high as 630,000. California’s Medicaid program is the largest in the United States. One out of every THREE citizens in the state of California are on Medicaid of some sort. Medicaid covers 13.4 million people in California. The annual budget for California’s Medicaid system is more than $100 billion. Ben Ippolito, an economist who specializes in healthcare expenditures at the American Enterprise Institute, suggested that the Department of Health and Human Services should perform a more in-depth analysis of California’s spending and ineligibility issues. Ippolito also pointed out that it is the federal government’s responsibility to ensure that state governments are properly spending federal aid money. Among other findings in the report, the inspector general’s office found that the state’s computer system for Medicaid and Medicare eligibility and reporting was deficient, and made it more difficult on caseworkers to report errors or possible ineligibility. Some of the ineligible recipients made too much money to be eligible for Medicaid benefits. Some of the beneficiaries in the audited sample were already enrolled in Medicare (government medical assistance for the elderly and severely disabled), and so were not eligible for Medicaid. In at least one instance, a woman indicated that she didn’t want Medi-Cal, but state Medi-Cal workers enrolled her in spite of her protest. The Medicaid expansion program, part of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), created a backlog of applicants in the state of California, which peaked at a backlog of more than 900,000 applications. The expansion program intended to cover newly eligible patients at a higher reimbursement rate. The program covered mostly childless, ‘low-income’ adults without children. Perhaps in order to ‘clear’ the backlog of 900,000 individuals, California officials simply stopped performing proper research into candidates. Whatever the case may be, wasting more than a billion dollars, for a state that consumes so much tax money every year, is absurd. A third of all California residents look to the government to pay for their medical expense. That’s absurd, and the state of California’s spending is out of control. Only two states in the United States have a greater percentage of their population covered by Medicaid and/or CHIP: New Mexico and West Virginia. If California is going to continuously refuse to cooperate with the federal government and declare itself a ‘sanctuary state,’ why should the rest of the United States continue to fund their wasteful and unverified medical spending? California, at the state level, needs to be a better steward of tax money overall. Actually properly vetting people on welfare is a fantastic place to start."
DNC Makes Outrageous Women’s Health Demand,28 MAR 2018,4972,"Just when it appears that liberals could not get any more ridiculous with their demands, they do. Feminists on behalf of the Democratic National Committee recently made outrageous requests in celebration of ‘Women’s History Month’ by demanding that feminine hygiene products be a free commodity, especially to women who are homeless or in prison. While there is truth to this problem on a humanitarian level, democrats are blowing the issue out of proportion, making exaggerated claims about the “economic justice issue” which is the simple reality that accompanies being female. One might think that feminists of all people would understand this, however, they have once again divided the nation, this time claiming that women are ‘period shamed’ in advocating for their party and for other females to join its efforts. For unknown reasons, on Tuesday the DNC allowed its Vice Chair and New York Representative Grace Meng to take over the organization’s Twitter account to advocate for free women’s hygiene products. She proposed that such products be made more readily available and that by the government not doing anything about helping the movement, they are causing female “punishment for their gender.” Meng continued to boast that she has been fighting for this ‘noble’ cause since 2015. She claims that making these products free to women would “level the playing field,” once against blaming the patriarchy for any of women’s failures. In keeping with true liberal logic, she claims that this issue mostly affects “low-income women,” despite the fact that women of all economic backgrounds face these struggles regularly. As if the argument were not disgusting enough in itself, Meng uses it a way to encourage women to vote democratically “in 2018 and beyond,” claiming that “women can’t wait for economic fairness any longer.” Unfortunately, it only gets worse. Meng even went as far as to propose to the Menstrual Equality for All Act to rid feminine hygiene products of their applicable sales taxes and to hand out an unlimited supply of these items to homeless women and prisoners. Of course, there would be a monetary component to this, and Meng’s suggestion is to allow “federal grant money to purchase tampons or pads.” In an explanation of her bill, Meng claims that women in prison must use the same supplies for days in a row, however, in explaining the number of products supplied to female prisoners, her math does not add up. She explains that the ‘taboo’ surrounding the issue has gotten in the way of advancements being made, but that 2015 was a victory year for women in that it was “the year the period went public.” What that means is that 2015 was when liberals officially began to lose their minds over the ‘tampon tax.’ Feminists are essentially demanding free or discounted products, even though that is undeniably sexist to men who would be forced to pay full taxes on their personal items. While prisoners should not be pitied too much, there is something to be said about the homeless population which still deserves humane treatment on some level. However, a line must be drawn somewhere to prevent the U.S. from becoming a socialistic society. If women’s hygiene products are given out at no discretion, liberals will soon demand that every person in the country be provided with free toothbrushes, underwear, or other items that one would normally pay for, as expected in a capitalistic society. Thankfully, Twitter users who have not completely lost sight of America’s priorities were vocal in their disapproval for Meng’s proposition. One user, @z7greens, humorously demanded, “Can we please get a real party to oppose the republicans?” However, the issue is serious considering that democrats want to spend excessive funding supporting illegal aliens, refugees, and those who do not work. To demand also that women be given free hygiene products is insane and insulting considering that there is a homeless population to begin with and that many of those individuals fought for America’s freedom. Of course, this clearly does not matter to Meng or other selfish liberals. She even said, “If Congress has to deny states certain federal funds to get their prisons to change their current horrendous practices, then so be it.” That in itself is telling of the left’s way of addressing the country’s apparent ‘needs.’ Forget the North Korean threat, school shootings, and constant attacks on the Constitution, Meng clearly believes that this is the most important issue the country is facing. Proving this, she has also called other female politicians to run for office for the sole reason of tackling this ‘women’s’ issue. While conservatives are unfortunate to have to hear this nonsense being addressed as a national issue, it is promising for the party. Apparently, this is one of the strongest arguments liberal feminists have, which is embarrassing for their platform but will hopefully benefit republicans come election season."
"Health Professionals Report New Drug, Bug Spray Mixed With Marijuana Or Spice",23 MAR 2018,2540,"When Russian heroin users discovered a (toxic) way to get the same high by mixing paint thinners and other chemicals into a concoction called “Krokodil,” videos surfaced of flesh rotting from bones as human’s walked around with rotting skin. Sadly, it seems that there are other things entering the culture which can be just as grim, as CBS Pittsburgh reports today. First responders in Indianapolis, Indiana, have found that “a drug laced with bug stray” is inducing “zombie-like” reactions and they are seeing a growing number of overdoses. Just as the above-mentioned Krocodil was a cheap way to keep feeding a needle habit, so it seems that this new drug is a reaction to the fact that fentanyl and other drugs are becoming harder to find. The CBS affiliate WTTV reported that the name of the drug is “KD.” It consists of adding a bug spray like Raid to marijuana, “spice,” or even just tobacco. Indianapolis Fire Department Captain Chris Major said that once the POISON is smoked, the user becomes “slow and lethargic.” Since this is exactly what is seen when cockroaches are sprayed with such chemicals as they are dying, this is a shock to no one. Drooling and “a loss of function” is also witnessed. It seems that even warning labels (which take up most of any can of bug spray) are not enough to stop the foolish from getting a quick buzz. “We find them with their clothes off, eating the grass, pulling dirt out of the ground and trying to put it in their mouth,” the mayor lamented. Medical staff members have seen over a dozen overdoses in just one day, sometimes featuring the same users more than once in a 24 hour period! Authorities are said to be looking for the “source of the drug,” which will likely be the local pest control center. Society can’t ban everything. Already, those in pain are being denied pills because of the number of people who don’t need them and choose to ingest them anyhow. Gun owners who have been peaceful their wholes lives are looked at as criminals by far too many others as doltish high school kids preach about limiting the Second Amendment. Some people are even moving to ban knives. Of course, all of that is pure folly. Many of those using drugs like KD are doing so just out of curiosity, they are not even sad or depressed, which can be the case with some drug users. Putting warning labels on everything and restricting everything is not going to help solve the problems. Perhaps a school curriculum that teaches self-worth, via a creator, would help, but that has already been banned."
"Health Class Takes Political Turn, Demands Youth Question Preferences",23 MAR 2018,5136,"The left has been recently guilty of attempting to culturally and politically influence America’s youth. These highly predatorial methods which have been unfortunately successful in swaying impressionable minds can be most recently seen in students pushing to have second amendment rights taken away. While that is disturbing enough and indicative of liberal teachers’ and administrators’ agendas, such concerns have also made their way into sex education curriculums. It was recently brought to one parent’s attention when his daughter was visibly disturbed at how the information provided encouraged her to question sexual identity and preferences despite being only 12-years-old. Jason Peterson, “a single parent with four other children” from Washington was shocked when his preteen daughter returned home after having participated in a sex ed program at her middle school last fall. She was reportedly crying, saying that the class made her question if she “was maybe a boy inside, or gay.” Of course, the father consulted the material which the program covered and was shocked to see that the liberal and LGBT agenda was being forced upon his child. Instead of the material including scientific information pertaining to anatomy and preventing pregnancy and diseases, it had a significantly heavier focus on gender and other similar issues which have dominated the liberal media. Peterson reported that 20 out of the 32 pages in the distributed material addressed topics mostly pertaining to gender identity. “It’s biased toward that,” he alleged. Peterson was required to sign off on the Sequim School District sex ed course for his daughter to participate, however, he had assumed that the material would be based on facts and not liberal opinions. The course went as far to suggest that students who have hobbies which are not typical of their genders may be transgender. Even though liberals and the gay community supposedly despise being stereotyped, the curriculum suggested that activities such as “skateboarding, fishing, wearing athletic gear, and playing basketball” were associated with being male. While interviewed, Peterson made it known that he does not discriminate against gay people but felt that the ‘informative’ material did. His daughter, he reported, “likes playing basketball, she likes going fishing with Dad, she likes skateboarding, and she likes being a girl.” Peterson was not alone in his concerns about what his child was learning in school and joined several fellow parents who also disproved of the curriculum. They voiced their concerns to the district superintendent, Gary Neal. Neal defended the program but also temporarily halted it. He comforted parents in assuring them that “a group will be formed to discuss content standards and age-appropriate issues for the sex-ed curriculum.” Admittedly, such a program perhaps ought to have already existed. In an interesting defense, the district is claiming to have been using the same education program provided by the Family Life and Sexual Health Curriculum, or FLASH, for about 30 years. However, it is impossible that parents would have allowed such a curriculum to continue for this amount of time, as the content is the epitome of the recent leftist agenda. Still, the director of the Community Health Services division for King County Heath, TJ Cosgrove, is defending the program, claiming that “the information about gender identity is…medically accurate and based in science.” While that can be argued in the scientific community, especially considering that conditions such as being intersex are proven and not part of the liberal sexual identity crisis, it is dangerous to base a young adult sex ed program on such topics. It is highly confusing for young adults, who, at the time of participating in sex ed programs, are generally not sexually active yet, to now be burdened with what gender they identify with or are attracted to. In focusing more on the feelings side of sexual health instead of the facts, students are likely to be misinformed regarding important material necessary to have safe and healthy sex lives as adults. Schools focusing heavily on gender identify topics are sure to neglect comprehensively covering vital information regarding pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases. These topics are critically important in raising responsible and healthy members of society. Although the school district in this case is shifting blame to the health services department and its associated programs, teachers and districts can be blamed for the content that they choose to provide. Reportedly, the FLASH program covers an extensive range of information “reviewed by teachers” which is then hand-chosen by the district as to what content will be covered. Spokespersons from the King County Public Health Department insist that FLASH is approved under CDC National Health Education Standards as well as the National Sexuality Education Standards. While all these logistics may be factual, it is still clear the educators pushing for school safety are endangering America’s youth in other, more personal ways."
Liberal College To Offer Course On How Gender And Class Create Health Conditions,13 MAR 2018,1981,"In the past couple of years, we have seen the left take the subject of gender and deny science and facts. We are being told that humans must forget biology and accept without question that there are countless genders and that the can be switched at will. Those who refuse to do this are labeled bigots or worse. It now appears that for at least five colleges in Massachusetts, the same adaptations are about to be made to disease. The University of Massachusetts (UMass) campus in Amherst, Massachusetts is offering a course called Feminist Health Politics. It will be taught by professor Svati Shah who also teaches Feminist Theory, LGBTQ Social Movements, and Gender and Sexuality. The course description implies that feminists need to target the oppression of disease. That is correct, the class descriptions states they will focus on; “why and how standards and adjudications of health vary according to gender, race, sexuality, class, and nationality; and how definitions of health affect the way we value certain bodies and ways of living.” The idea seems to be that disease can be used to oppressed people based on gender or race. This is a new claim from the left or at least one that hasn’t gained much mainstream traction yet. America can look forward to that if classes like this catch on. The course will “examine how health becomes defined, and will question whether health and disease are objectively measured conditions or subjective states.” The class is being offered by UMass but will be available to all students in the state’s Five College Consortium. This includes Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and Amherst College. Unsurprisingly, the five colleges have many classes like this. These include “Sissies, Studs and Butches,” which claims to challenge “Western, hegemonic and inherent legacies of masculinity,” and a course called “Transgender.” In that class, they state that they will examine “the role of Western medical ideologies.”"
Mental Health Doctor Guilty Of Preying On Gay Patients,12 MAR 2018,3724,"WARNING: This article contains graphic content of a sexual nature and may be offensive to some readers.  Contrary to what the left says, there is a lot of success in the idea that some gay people can be turned around from the practice with proper therapy. That said, there are times when the help does not work, and sometimes that is the fault of the caregiver. That may certainly be the case as Dr. Melvyn Iscove, 72, was found to have been having sex with his male patients as they went to him for help with the issue, according to the Star. Iscove is a Toronto psychiatrist who holds to the traditional scientific findings of conversion therapy which show that homosexuality is a “sexual disorder,” and something that can be helped. While each case is different, this is true for a great number of homosexuals, even if they wish not to admit it. Regrettably, this branch of scientific thought just suffered a black eye as this Canadian doctor was found to have engaged in sex with at least two of his male patients. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario’s discipline committee found that he showed a “special interest in the treatment of patients with problems related to homosexuality.” The reason for such an interest seems to have revealed itself in the interests of this doctor, who betrayed those who trusted him. It is known that he “engaged in mutual masturbation and oral sex with two male patients on different occasions,” even while therapy was to be taking place. Sodomy was even engaged in within the office. Since he is already in trouble for a case pending regarding “improper conduct in a public men’s washroom,” things are looking worse and worse for the man. “Neither complainant described any emotional or romantic aspects of the sexual activity with Dr. Iscove, and both said that at some point, they thought that the sexual activity was part of the therapy and an attempt to cure them of homosexuality by engaging in the acts, rather than fantasizing about them,” the five-member panel wrote. The doctor’s license to practice medicine has been suspended, and if a guilty verdict is reached, he will have it revoked. He asked a person known only as “(Patient A),” “What are you thinking you want to do?” for saying, “You may touch me if you like.” From there, the confused patient felt the man’s hardened penis. “(Patient B) considered beginning a homosexual affair with an unspecified male. After discussing this with Dr. Iscove, who persuaded him that a random partner was undesirable, Dr. Iscove made it known that he, himself, would be available,” the panel also discovered. It would appear from this that the doctor was doing nothing but exploiting what he called a “disorder” to feed his own homo-erotic lusts. “We’re both very disappointed with the result, obviously,” admitted the doctor’s lawyer, Alfred Kwinter. “Dr. Iscove has always denied the allegations, he continues to do so, and he’s seriously considering an appeal.” Up until 1992, homosexuality was considered a disorder. Against the advice of a very large number of people within the medical community, it was removed from the list and in 2005, Canada made the horrible decision to ban “conversion therapy,” a treatment that was a great benefit to many who honestly pursued it. As the debate rages on, there are plenty of people who have been helped and those who call the idea of a “gay cure” quackery, both vying for attention. Since chemicals like BPA can alter hormones and make a person soft towards their own gender, it may not be as cut and dry as either side says. While answers are sought, it would certainly be helpful if the waters were not muddied by doctors who can’t seem to tell the difference themselves."
"125 Out of 600,000, Health Nonprofit Identifies Teen Disease Cluster",10 MAR 2018,4729,"According to different reports, an outbreak of sexually transmitted disease is seriously hitting the Milwaukee area. What seems to be one of the most concerning details about this horrible case is the fact that an alarming percentage of the patients are actually teenagers. Believe it or not, at least 125 people have contracted syphilis, HIV, or both in what has been described as one of the largest sexually transmitted infection “clusters” ever discovered in this city and in the so-called “refugee ridden state” of Wisconsin. Apparently, some of the 125 people that have been harmed by these diseases are high school students, meaning that the epidemic has already reached some academic institutions. Media outlets noted that while less than 10 percent of the 125 people who tested positive are Milwaukee Public Schools students, healthcare experts anticipate the number of cases could easily go up in the next few days. On this issue, the spokeswoman for the Milwaukee Public Schools Denise Callaway told media outlets that they are working with the health department to provide preventative information for the students. In addition, she explained that they have the unique ability to reach hundreds of students at one time with substantial information that could protect their health. Regarding this incredible crisis, Public Health Consultant Melissa Ugland explained that this is an epidemic people are not talking about enough. According to her words, this situation makes people take unnecessary risks regarding their sexual lives. As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “clusters” could be defined as an unusual aggregation of diseases that are grouped together in time and place. Ugland pointed out this cluster was identified because the patients could all be connected and were in contact with each other during a period of one year. Apparently, most of those who were tested in this group were men. According to Ugland and many other healthcare advocates, 45 percent of these men were HIV positive. One of the most controversial details about this concerning situation is the fact that the information about which school or schools are affected by the cluster hasn’t been released. While many believe this is information that should be published in order to take the necessary measures, some others believe that the consequences of this move could be harmful to the city. What seems even more concerning is the fact that healthcare officials recently confirmed via Twitter that three local babies were also born with syphilis. The Milwaukee Health Department tweeted that there has been a terrible increase in new cases of HIV and syphilis, including infants in 2017. Believe it or not, this department recently released a statement that reveals how the entire city of Milwaukee is suffering an incredible increase in sexually transmitted infections in young people ages 15 to 24. The statement points out that because schools have an important number of students in the age group of 15 to 18, the department is now working with the Milwaukee Health Department in a collaborative and preventive effort to share every single piece of information with young people in high schools and middle schools. The statement concludes that the goal of this move is to keep these young people healthy and to protect their health in the most efficient way. According to Ugland, it is quite possible that the number of those people affected with syphilis or HIV could grow. She pointed out that the cluster was still considered ongoing. On the other hand, former health commissioner Bevan Baker reportedly met with Mayor Tom Barret in order to brief him about the cluster. Different reports pointed out these meetings happened in December and again in early January. Apparently, this last meeting was just a week before the mayor decided to resign over troubles with the city’s lead-poisoning prevention programs. Recently, the Milwaukee Health Department started to launch a campaign on the city’s public transit system to inform riders about the threats of sexually transmitted diseases. This action was made in an effort to create public awareness and prevent further spread of HIV and syphilis. According to the Journal Sentinel, after a patient tests positive for an infection, they are eventually referred for care and interviewed about their sexual history. Apparently, officials then reach out to others who may have been infected so they could also be tested and treated. Different reports revealed that while some people in the cluster have been quite cooperative, there are others who have been extremely hesitant to reveal names or any single information about their previous sexual partners."
South American Virus Spreads As Health Officials Cannot Keep Up With Vaccinations,6 MAR 2018,3288,"The proverbial ink is hardly dry on news about the spreading of the plague and talk of the end times (from some) when news of another horror-inducing illness makes the headlines. As if the Black Death were not enough, Yellow Fever is blanketing Brazil and the nation is having a dreadfully hard time vaccinating everyone. For those trusting the vaccine (and some do not), this is awful news. Some of those who do have faith in it “showed up as early as midnight” with air mattresses and chairs, as if attending a parade. Sadly, as the Los Angeles Times reports, ” in downtown Sao Paulo, Brazil,” this line was for the shot. Some people stood in line for hours, fearful of not getting protection from the illness. “Make sure you have your vaccination card and your number in hand,” shouted a clinic worker. Only about 300 of the vaccinations, which are good for life, were available. That fact alone is a travesty! How could mankind have, with such knowledge achieved, allowed the return of such a disease without having what is needed on hand ahead of time? “If you’re not here when your number is called, you’ll lose your place in line!” warns the same worker. The potentially deadly virus is “transmitted by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes and named for the yellowing of the skin and eyes of those infected.” Even with this wisdom well established, Brazil has dropped the ball when it comes to stopping the onslaught. It is worried that the spread of the fever, which so far has been plaguing rural areas, could soon hit the cities. To cover for how badly the system has failed in Brazil, supposed experts are giving only partial doses which they say are effective for 8 years. “Why would I only want only part of a vaccination?” asked Isabel Antonia Martins. “We don’t know if it will have the same effect as a full dose. I’m not taking any chances, especially with the way yellow fever has been spreading.” “It’s a case of opportunity,” admitted Mauricio Nogueira, president of the Brazilian Society for Virology. “To urbanize, it would need a population that is susceptible [to the virus] and mosquitoes that are susceptible to the city. So the quicker we control these rural outbreaks, the lower the chances that it will urbanize.” He also said, “It’s something we can’t waver on. We need to vaccinate the largest number of people as quickly as possible.” Meanwhile, bacteria pneumonia has been tied to the vaccine, at least according to a “post on Facebook claiming a teenager died because of side effects from the yellow fever vaccine.” It has long been known that the jab is not as safe as some experts claim. “Brazilians should be more concerned about the transparency of their government,” stated Nogueira. “The government needs to be very clear and needs to explain why it didn’t start vaccinating last year. It needs to say, ‘Look, we didn’t have enough vaccines then.’ And it needs to admit that what we have right now is an epidemic.” While each person should be free to choose whether or not to accept the risks associated with the vaccine, the fact that the Brazillian government has failed the people so badly is inexcusable. It also causes us to wonder what will happen the next time that they are needed. Sources: The Conservative Daily Post – The Los Angeles Times"
Seattle Police Confiscate First Firearm Under New “Mental Health” Law,5 MAR 2018,2046,"In what many believe is the beginning of a Constitutional crisis, the Seattle Police Department confiscated a firearm from an individual. The new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and police to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The Washington man has not been identified, but he was the first victim of the new protection orders allowing police to confiscate his firearm amid mental health concerns. Neighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. Open carrying is legal in the area, so he was allowed to carry a firearm. Other residents also complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe.” “He was roaming the hallways with a .25 caliber automatic,” said Tony Montana, a man who lives in the same apartment complex as the alleged suspect. “And it created a lot of fear obviously because I didn’t know if he was coming after me or gonna just start shooting the place up,” he added. These lousy complaints from neighbors allowed police to use the newly passed state law to confiscate the man’s firearm because the man apparently stared at others. Under the extreme risk protection orders — also referred to as “erpos” or “red flag laws” —  police and courts are allowed to infringe on a person’s Second Amendment rights and take their firearm if they are deemed dangerous. That means state government officials can now take guns away from an individual without even making an arrest. This overreaching new law allows for dictatorial actions to confiscate weapons from citizens that are arbitrarily deemed guilty and/or dangerous without due process. This scathing attempt by Democrats to infringe on citizens right to bear arms should concern all Americans. Source: Conservative Institute"
Big Pharma Races To Acquire Health Information On Citizens,1 MAR 2018,4744,"Large pharmaceutical companies have been in a race to acquire tech companies in order to achieve the competitive edge. Using large analytical data models, health companies believe they will be able to study the effects of medicine more effectively. By acquiring patient health records, drug makers will be able to better study real-time symptoms and remedial effects. The health records being demanded by the drug manufacturers are made possible by the creation of a national database. Previously, drug companies have been using randomized clinical trials to monitor the effects of new medicines. With the $2 billion purchase of Flatiron Health, Roche Holdings, a multinational pharmaceutical and analytics company, signals to the value of medical health records. Being able to monitor each person individually, drug manufacturers will be better equipped to customize and fine-tune medical drugs. Creating an efficient database to track the different drugs and patients, drug companies have looked to the computer companies for assistance. Seeking help from the companies with the skills and assets to utilize private medical records, big medicine is teaming up with Silicon Valley. Tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have begun looking into the business of healthcare. Creating electronic records and databases, Silicon Valley has identified a very lucrative niche. The partnership between medicine and technology represents the lack of privacy between consumer and corporation. The same companies that placed a phone in everyone’s pocket are now acquiring access to everyone’s medical records. Many experts and activists have raised concerns that the data will begin to be used primarily for advertising purposes. The health industry has responded to the claims of intrusion by announcing the study will yield greater insights into every patient’s unique case. Especially in the fight against cancer, more specific longer-term studies will be extremely useful. As clinical trials become less reliable, the healthcare industry’s new approach is being seen as a savior. Being more cost effective and resulting in a landslide of data, sourcing patient’s medical information may help the company as much as the patient. The increasing digitization of medical records was seen as a breakthrough in the medical field. Now, these electronic records are being eyed by industry regulators. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is a proponent of the real-world evidence (RWE) gathered by the pharmaceutical companies. Being in charge of the largest pharmaceutical market in the world, Gottlieb announced the new developments could result in lowered drug costs and provide doctors with more options. One of the last acts of legislation passed under the Obama administration is the 21st Century Cures Act which directed the FDA to expand the use of real-world examples. Effectively mandating private health records be turned over to giant corporations, the bill was signed in December of 2016. European counterparts have signed similar legislation. Britain originally turned down proposals to use health records for commercial and academic purposes in 2016. A year later, a prominent British hospital was indicted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for misusing patient information. Releasing the data to Google’s DeepMind, an artificial intelligence research and development division, the hospital surrendered the documents of 1.6 million patients. The question of the real-world evidence has drawn critical criticism at the heart of the issue. To whom does health information belong? Medical companies and health care providers are now battling for ownership over the medical records. Competing with drug manufacturers and the patient, the lucrative health records are drawing deep divisions inside the medical field. Many in the industry vow to only use the information for scientific gain. The sheer number of groups trying to use the private information for more commercial means is not reassuring. The Chief Executive officer of Roche, Severin Schwan, expressed excitement over the new deal. Declaring the company’s leadership position in oncology and diagnostic medicine will be reaffirmed. Schwan declared that the pharmaceutical company is not looking to win ownership over the medical records but would rather see a partnership with data management. Apple’s latest iPhone update included a patch that would allow the user to check their medical information. Amazon has announced to declare a partnership with JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to develop a new healthcare company. Consumers continue to forego privacy rights for convenience earning big corporations billions."
"City Attorney Gets Fleeced, Brings Case Against NY Health Insurers",28 FEB 2018,2583,"The scenario is not unfamiliar to many in America. Anyone is susceptible to falling ill suddenly, needing procedures, and racking up debt. If you are lucky, you have insurance which will pay for the bulk of the bills. After all, isn’t that why people pay for insurance? A New York employee is finding out just how wrong that assumption can be. 37-year-old Kami Barker worked as an attorney for the city’s Law Department. Between February 2012 and November 2013 she was hospitalized four times resulting in $1.26 million in hospital bills. She was stunned when she found out her portion would be about $260,000. She is now filing a lawsuit against two of New York’s biggest insurers to the tune of $1 billion that she wants to be returned to the city. That is how much she believes they were able to get in a sneaky “save money” clause in their policies. Barker is bringing the lawsuit under the state’s False Claims Act, a whistleblower protection where she will be awarded up to 30 percent of the payout if she wins. The suit is against Empire Blue Cross-Blue shield and its partner Emblem Health. When Barker became ill she found out the unbelievable conditions on her so-called full insurance. According to her lawsuit, the companies “deliberately exaggerated the benefits available under the plan, while understating the uncovered costs that must be paid by members.” An example is in Barker’s plan summary which declares that if she chooses in-network hospitals, she can “save money.” However, undisclosed in the policy was the fact that many of the doctors working in the hospital are out-of-network. Out of the total $1.26 million in medical bills Barker accrued, Empire and Emblem only paid $625,000 to the in-network doctors and hospitals. She is expected to pay the rest. She told reporters; “So my room and board was paid for but my doctors were not, my surgical procedures were not, and my medicine was not. That’s how I ended up getting footed with all these bills.”
 The total damages for Barker; $13,000 in deductibles and copays, $164,000 for out-of-network costs, $47,000 for denied claims, and $32,000 for lost claims. Barker and her lawyer Steve Cohen also uncovered what they call “old-fashioned accounting fraud to overcharge the city for insurance services.” They state that in a 50-page report submitted by Emblem every year, the profit and loss statement claimed $1.31 billion for claims. Buried on another page was a very different figure, $1.23 billion. The conclusion seems simple. The companies have not commented on the lawsuit yet. Source: New York Post"
Death Row Inmate Cheats Death Due To Health Issues,27 FEB 2018,2263,"The death penalty is used for only the most heinous criminals. However, even considering that these are the lowest members of society, inmates on death row are still human beings with constitutional rights. The process of lethal injection can hardly be referred to as ‘torture,’ but that is not stopping a death row inmate’s lawyer from referring to the practice as such after prison officials had difficulties administering the fatal medication. Doyle Lee Hamm, 61, of Alabama has been on death row for the murder of a motel employee, Patrick Cunningham, in 1987 and has been awaiting execution at the Holman Correctional Facility located in Escambia County. Hamm was to be put to death on Thursday, however, officials were unable to end his life upon facing difficulties administering lethal injection. Hamm has suffered from lymphoma and hepatitis, along with having a history of drug abuse which has made his veins hard to locate. To give him the lethal injection, officials were required to try multiple places on his body. One of which likely pierced Hamm’s bladder, as he reportedly had blood in his urine following the attempt. His attorney, Bernard Harcourt, is also noting that “the execution team may have also hit Hamm’s femoral artery,” due to excessive bleeding. After two hours of failed attempts, prison officials finally gave up trying to find a suitable vein, as instructed by the state. Prison state commissioner Jeff Dunn reported that it was also a “time issue,” as the prison only had until midnight to perform the execution. He referred to the failed capital punishment as “wrongful execution,” which, of course, violates the eighth amendment protecting citizens from cruel and unusual punishment. However, it is important to still consider that Hamm is a convicted murderer who should not be pitied. The incident brings up a very important issue to consider: alternatives to lethal injection when it is not a possibility. While Harcourt is suggesting that lethal injection in Alabama be outlawed, this would permit violent criminals to take the easy way out for their crimes. In carrying out justice for the victim’s family, it is critical that an alternative is determined to end the life of this criminal as the court previously decided."
How The News Is Affecting Americans’ Health,27 FEB 2018,5453,"As it turns out, it is not only “you” laying there at night, looking up the ceiling or covering both eyes in order to try and hide from insomnia. No one is alone who feels as if the sheer exhaustion of life is going to overtake them. USA Today finds that this is only too common, though many of the reasons that they list seem to cater to more recent happenings than the root causes. They list (take a deep breath), “Wildfires, terror attacks, rising tensions with North Korea, racist rallies, political investigations in Washington, the non-stop barrage of presidential tweets, more and worse mass shootings from Las Vegas to Florida, a tsunami of sexual harassment accusations, the role of Russians in our elections, climate change, red state-blue state division and not one, not two, but three of the worst hurricanes on record — including one that nearly blew Puerto Rico out of the Caribbean Sea.” Even some experts at the American Psychological Association and the Ethical Culture Society are taking notice. While the great loss of life in places like Vegas and Florida has hurt us deeply as a people, those are not root causes for any of real stress. Rather, the fact that the media tells us to always fight over such topics is a far greater hint at where this unhappiness comes from, though this is only briefly addressed. New Jersey (dot com) has found that part of the reason rests with the “the chaos of life and its collision with technology and tragedy,” which is true only in part. For those who never get really to see their spouse or best friend without them gazing into a cell phone, this is true. For those who use the phone for “Google Maps” and who don’t run out of gas lost on some empty road because of it, technology is a calming thing. It all depends on how it is used….and when. Our happiness levels are dropping as our families are disintegrating and our marriages are in turmoil. All parties involved seem to care more about themselves than anyone else, more than any promise that they have made, or any sense of unity that is what the United States was named for. “I do see an increase in anxiety in my practice,” admitted therapist Sophia Richman. “Patients are more anxious. They’re having anxiety dreams. There’s a sense that there is some threat to them, an amorphous threat, and they wake up in a sweat. There is a sense of danger — that we’re living in very dangerous times.” While some shall scoff (and such is their right), that sounds a lot like what certain religious scripts say happens when evil is embraced by a culture. Even the nonreligious tend to gravitate against true evil, though that line is so heavily blurred now that it is hard to overstate. This, according to history, has always led to misery. A report from the American Psychological Association entitled “Stress in America” revealed that “63% of Americans say the future of the nation is a very or somewhat significant source of stress for them.” Countless people every day are sensing this as it seems as though there is no stopping the ball from rolling over us. “I don’t know whether we are overwhelmed, cowed into silence or just not cognizant of the danger,” stated Joe Chuman. He is a “professional leader of the Teaneck branch of the Ethical Culture Society, a humanist society that goes back to the 19th century.” He added, “But I have never been more fearful for our country than right now. My sense is that people may be just so overwhelmed by the reality, almost like a deer in a headlight, that they don’t know how to respond to what I consider real danger. These are not normal times.” As for those aforementioned souls who never get a meal with a loved one without the cell phone coming out, this is only making it worse. “I think many of our folks are getting information-overloaded, always connected to their smartphones and tablets and laptops,” warned the Rev. Dr. David Bocock, pastor of the Cresskill Congregational Church. The holy man has found that many in his flock and elsewhere are turning away from such constant phone and data checking. “I think a lot of them are taking a break from it,” he said. “Because everybody’s on it, and everybody’s friends all think the way they do. They’re not really getting alternative views. So their fears are getting reinforced, whether they’re conservative or liberal. [The fear is] driving them crazy, emotionally and spiritually crazy. So I think a few folks are just taking a sabbatical from their devices. Those who do experience this kind of peace they didn’t have before.” Frank Borman talked about the space mission and how many felt that it could never happen in America’s past. Likewise, Gina Miccinilli feels that art helps others unwind. “Artists are on the periphery of society, so we’re looking at it from a critical perspective,” she says. Other ideas were offered to help stave off the stress, but we have to admit a few things to ourselves that USA Today just did not address. There is hardly one thing in our culture that does not try to sell, speak, or pander to our own egos. As that happens, the ego becomes the primary focus and all other concerns fade away. So, while everyone may, in fact, be on their phones too much or be too ready to pick sides based on party affiliation, the root of the problem is much, much deeper. No one’s stress will diminish one title until we accept that. Sources: The Conservative Daily Post – The U.S.A. Today – New Jersey (dot com)"
"Facebook Addresses Mental Health Crisis, Monitors User Activity",24 FEB 2018,5686,"Facebook is using artificial intelligence to detect and prevent suicide to intervene during a crisis. The social media giant has added new technology to automatically flag posts with suicidal thoughts. A staff of humans can then analyze the content, where formerly the company relied on users to flag it for review. For some, it is an effective tool to identify suicidal tendencies. For others, it is “Big Brother” watching, which is concerning since the AI only works half of the time. In November, a new set of tools were launched to help people “manage their relationships on Facebook.” Afterwards, the company alerted first-responders over 100 times. Now the program is flagging 20 times more content than before and twice as many users are receiving “support materials.” The tools are reportedly still in the early stages of development. Facebook’s “compassion team” deals with breakups, deaths, and suicide. It also looks at issues with violence and bullying, which are qualitatively different in terms of surveillance. Nevertheless, with billions of active users every month, the company believes it has a clear role to play. Facebook‘s AI research lab, established in 2013 and lead by Yann LeCun, now includes technology that can analyze photos, translate text, and transcribe videos. Facebook has hired Jerome Pesenti, former IBM chief scientist who helped build IBM’s Watson. The Watson computer can answer questions asked in natural language. AI scientist Umut Ozertem, who has worked with Yahoo and Microsoft, had not heard of these tools before but noted them to be an interesting method for intervening in possible tragedy. Lizzy Donahue, engineer and advocate for the LGBT community, reported that the intervention methods were inspired by the help center of Facebook where users can find answers and support. Industry leaders wanted to create an automated system that “understands context” and can recognize subtleties in human behavior. The team is also focused on immediate flagging, and not waiting for reactions and comments from other users. This makes sense in terms of preventing suicide, but the other ways in which this could be used to manipulate consumers or predict trends are concerning. A San Francisco therapist, Aileen Cho, submits that people might alter their interactions if they realize that Facebook is always listening for suicidal thoughts. Users might stop using the platform entirely if they believe that their thoughts are being monitored for subtle changes and nuanced feelings which are open to interpretation or exploitation. There is little doubt Facebook has an interest in using this technology to prevent the misuse of the platform, like during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook has been accused of using their algorithms to censor conservative voices in media. New algorithms were implemented in an attempt to reduce content such as the Conservative Daily Post in the newsfeed. A German court has ruled that it is illegal for the company to use personal information without the consent of the user. It is clear that the company can update their policies and ask for consent, but this sometimes happens after the fact, similar to when users’ locations were automatically shown to others on the app. Facebook co-founder, Sean Parker, recently said that the initial goal of social media was to make users want to spend as much time as possible on the site. The “social-validation feedback loop” exploited a vulnerability in the human psyche. Parker now views himself as a “conscientious objector.” Facebook, as a for-profit company, is to some degree reasonably working to create a better product. This becomes questionable when the platform is used to deploy psychological studies that examine emotional responses. The site was manipulated to change the number of positive and negative posts that appear in the timeline. Privacy activists responded by questioning the test’s effect on emotionally unstable people. The research found that when negative content spread, it influenced viewers to post more negatively. What a revelation! Perhaps the real outcome or directive remains unknown. What might you do with the “god view” of a couple billion user accounts? What can be learned from compiling public information from such a large dataset? Facebook now touts a feature to help users get over a breakup. Instead of purging the account, one can answer a series of questions about how much of their ex’s profile they wish to see. Studies have shown that social media can actually contribute to “negative relationship outcomes,” cheating and jealousy being major contributors to dissatisfaction. As society is more experienced with psychological issues and the free flow of information, questions to consider are how influential social media platforms should be and what their social responsibilities are. The sheriff in Chautauqua County, New York, Joseph Gerace, does not see Facebook suicide watch as an intrusion. In conjunction with Facebook representatives, he once helped a woman who posted threats to herself. By including key phrases used by people who suffer from depression, algorithms can offer help by returning results such as links to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Software engineer on the Facebook compassion team, Dan Muriello, feels that it is important to get help to as many people as possible. In the future, AI will continue to direct our online interactions in new and exciting ways. If it can help save a life, that is a great gift. If it can do it in such a way as to preserve the privacy of those who do not need help, it would be truly amazing."
California Health Benefits Provider Refusing Access To Auditors,23 FEB 2018,4933,"A California-based Obamacare provider is hiding the ball by refusing to cooperate with the Office of Inspector General. By refusing to cooperate with a security audit, Health Net of California “breached” their contract and the hammer is about to come down hard. Health Net, Inc.’s “actions are in direct violation of the company’s contract with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and also disregard the statutory authority of the OIG,” a recent government flash audit warns. Not only does Health Net provide coverage under the Affordable Care Act, they offer “HMO, POS, insured PPO and government contract” insurance to “5.9 million individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through group, individual, Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare and Veterans Affairs programs.” Health Net is part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program which administers health plans for all government and military employees. “Auditors cannot evaluate Health Net’s IT security controls,” the report states. “As a result, we are unable to attest whether Health Net is acting as a responsible custodian” of “critically sensitive” personally identifiable and protected health information. Health data is a goldmine for hackers and the OPM branch of the Inspector General considers protecting it vital to our national security. Enough is at stake to fully justify an in-depth audit of the insurance provider’s IT systems. As part of the contract with Health Net, OPM is allowed to “scan the company’s IT systems.” That means “its entire IT environment.” Health Net of California says that is way beyond the “scope” of what they are willing to allow. The auditors want to examine and test Health Net’s systems directly but the company says the reports from self-administered scans are all they are going to get. Months of “pre-audit communications” happened leading up to a meeting between government and company officials on January 22. They interviewed some of the staff and planned to “follow up with systems testing in mid-February.” As the deadline approached, auditors started to realize that they were never going to get answers to “13 separate data requests with due dates spanning between Jan. 22 and Feb. 1.” “As of Feb. 6, not a single document had been provided to us. Furthermore, Health Net refused to confirm that it would deliver the requested items or let us perform critical vulnerability and configuration management testing.” The OIG sent Health Net a memo the same day “and asked, point blank, whether the insurer planned to cooperate.” The next day, Health net responded, “no.” The giant conglomerate is now in jeopardy of losing all their colossal contracts with the federal government over the serious data security issue. Failure to meet OPM standards for Health Benefits Carriers may be cause for OPM’s withdrawal of approval of a health benefits carrier and termination of a contract,” a spokesman for the OPM relates. Health Net did provide some information, “including a limited list of employees and associated user ID’s that have access to federally relevant systems.” That is only a drop in the bucket compared to the comprehensive data the OIG requires. The inspectors want “information on employee access systemwide” and the ability to directly perform full vulnerability scans. “Although we focus on servers that directly process or store FEHBP data, we judgmentally select other high-risk servers to include in the scope of testing.” The report points out that the chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Another thing the audit points out is that the fact Health Net is doing so much foot-dragging is highly unusual and suspicious all by itself. “Health Net’s refusal to allow this standard audit test work as part of our audit leaves multiple questions about Health Net’s vulnerability and configuration management programs unanswered.” “OPM inspectors general have been conducting these types of vulnerability assessments for more than 10 years across some 70 unique IT environments.” “In that time, they have never been denied the kind of access being requested. Health Net’s refusal to provide complete access and termination lists is unprecedented in our IT audits.” “The company has offered to provide copies of its own scans limited to the part of the network and servers that directly process FEHBP claims,” one OIG official informs. “The OIG has rejected that approach many times in the past, not just at Health Net but at other carriers, because our independently conducted scans have shown that carriers often have inadequate scanning programs. Our scanning tests are designed to uncover those weaknesses in their scanning programs, not just to find system weaknesses,” like missing patches. The official adds, “there is nothing unique about Health Net, its technical environment, or the nature of our proposed testing that would exempt Health Net from our oversight and this testing.”"
"Public Health Teachers Ignore Morals, Explain Adult Films To Students",22 FEB 2018,4931,"Warning: This article contains adult subject matter that may be offensive to some readers. One of the most dreaded of all conversations that parents have to have with their children has long been ‘the talk,’ where they tell their children, at very least, where babies come from. However, public health educators in Boston, Massachusetts, have accepted that now, teens and ‘children’ are getting their ideas about sex from pornography. As such, they have decided that it falls to them to teach classes on ‘porn literacy.’ These ‘porn literacy’ classes are paid for via a publicly funded initiative in Boston. This initiative is called Start Strong: Building Healthy Teen Relationships. It was meant to be and sold to voters as, an initiative that would focus on dating violence. Somehow, it blossomed to include classes on ‘porn literacy.’ Now, to be fair to the school district, rather than the class being a required class for graduation, it is simply an ‘after-school elective.’ However, it is still an elective teaching children about things that they would be better served learning about in a health class. Or, even better, in a discussion with their parents, as uncomfortable as that discussion may be for everyone involved. The ‘after-school elective’ course is designed to give students an understanding of ‘sex’ viewed through the spectrums of health, safety, and PHYSICAL PLEASURE. This is a big difference from most ‘sex-ed’ courses offered by public schools to high school students, which tend to focus on biology and safety. Students in sex-ed courses have generally been taught about the mechanical process of sex, and what happens, biologically, during and after. They are also taught about what can go wrong during intercourse, most importantly the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (once called sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, the term has since been updated for accuracy). This course, according to its own testimonials, focuses on, “not yucking on someone’s yum.” That is apparently the very adult language that the course uses to reference the idea of not ‘shaming’ people for the things that ‘turn them on.’ The class also aims to teach them to be more ‘woke’ in their consumption of pornography, by examining various aspects of the films such as gender, aggression, race, and the usual litany of social justice warrior-approved concepts and how they play out in pornography. An article about the class in the New York Times provided the sordid details of conversations that occurred in the class. The article is easy to find online, but the majority of discussion in the class seems to involve discussing what the students have seen in pornography and the (often incorrect, dangerous, and disturbing) lessons they have taken from it. One thing that the New York Times,  and seemingly the class, which is properly titled ‘The Truth About Pornography: A Pornography-Literacy Curriculum for High School Students Designed to Reduce Sexual and Dating Violence,’ never seems to touch on, though, is that pornography is a business. It’s not a place to learn about how to have sex with someone. Pornography, especially in an age when most are viewed via clicks and not by paying for movies or pictures, is a business. Because of this, the things in pornography (which is mostly aimed at its target market, men) are not necessarily representative of reality. Quite the opposite, really. Pornography can be viewed through a similar lens as any television show or film. It’s designed to make viewers watch it and to get them to watch more. Because of this, reactions are exaggerated, content is exaggerated, almost everything is exaggerated. Women in pornography seem to be up for anything and to enjoy it all. But that’s not the real world, and that’s not what young men (or women) should be taught is a realistic expectation of sex. As one of the students in the class said, “I’ve never seen a girl in porn who doesn’t look like she’s having a good time.” The reality can be much different. Further, the class, which claims it is teaching ‘critical thinking’ concerning pornography, seems to be more based around the idea of discussing pornography, not teaching students to have a meaningful and yes, sexual, relationship. The pornographic industry is not something to use as a teaching tool for children. It’s an industry that breaks spirits, abuses individuals, and puts some people in danger.  It’s an industry that has led more than a few ‘stars’ recently to suicide and drug addiction. The class also doesn’t talk about the long-term damages that over-consumption of pornography can cause to a relationship or a person. At the end of the day, this elective course seems to do little more than give high school students the chance to discuss pornography that they’ve recently watched with adults, something that sounds more at home on an episode of ‘To Catch A Predator’ than a school system."
Shopper Snaps Picture Of Disgusting Health Conditions,30 JAN 2018,5007,"A California 99 Ranch Market supermarket and a local meat distributor are facing major investigations regarding a customer account of raw meat being improperly delivered to a store. On January 14, in San Jose, a shopper, Loretto Seto, witnessed a horribly unsanitary practice occurring, notifying the community and all 99 Ranch Market customers of the “new level of gross” that she saw taking place. The photographs that Seto took, captioned “Beware,” which were later confirmed by surveillance footage, shows a meat vendor delivering large slabs of raw meat by piling the shipment directly into Costco shopping carts and wheeling them into the store. The vendor later determined to be Jim’s Farm Meat Co., is the new target of the investigation. The supermarket chain has since terminated relations to the distributor, and Jim’s Farm Meat fired the employees delivering the shipment, however, the Santa Clara Department of Environmental Health has begun an investigation of the plant. Jim’s Farm Meat, based in Winton, California is being scrutinized, however, Ranch Market is receiving criticism from having a business relationship with a company using such practices. Costco has also yet to comment on its store’s carts being “illegitimately” used in the meat transport, but will unlikely be tied to the investigation. It is unclear why the meat packaging company employees did not opt to use equally unsanitary Ranch Market carts instead. Seto’s initial Facebook post has reached thousands of viewers who will undoubtedly reconsider shopping at Ranch Market or other wholesalers who use a variety of distributors such as Jim’s Farm Meat. The reoccurring comment being made on social media is that if the unsanitary practice had gone unnoticed, many Ranch Market customers and their families could have become seriously ill from consuming the mishandled meat. If the workers were careless enough to pile unpackaged product into a dirty shopping cart, then there is no telling how else the meat may have been mishandled, considering critically important temperature zones that raw meat must be kept at to avoid food-borne illness. Jim’s Farm Meat is being investigated. However, Seto was right to warn to warn other consumers of the potentially hazardous food item. The meat packing plant is obviously incompetent in hiring and training employees of safe handling practices and stressing the importance of meat being kept safe, as it is highly susceptible to bacterial diseases which could be fatal in some people such as young children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. Citizens throughout Santa Clara County were spared becoming ill. A tragedy could have occurred from one or two employee’s carelessness. It is, however, concerning that other batches of infected meat could already be in the fridges and freezers of California residents if this practice has ever been used before but went unnoticed. Even worse, the shipment was reportedly solely pork meat, which arguably requires stricter sanitation measures to prevent illness transmissions than other meats. The meat vendor, defends the integrity of the company, saying that transporting their products in filthy shopping carts is not something they “typically do.” A spokesperson for Jim’s Farm Meat, Maria Moon claimed that meat always leaves the processing plant in wrapped packages “in a combo bin,” and that that was how the shipment in question was sent out. Moon continued that the company holds no responsibility for the employees who thought transporting meat in such a way was acceptable but have since terminated them. She continues to express confusion that the delivery workers would remove the meat from its packaging, but never once considers that perhaps the meat was never packaged to begin with. She further “declined to comment” about the incident while the investigation is still occurring, though, as expected, the 99 Ranch Market has also filed a complaint against the meat distributor. The incident is undoubtedly serious given the highly unsanitary conditions and has alerted “regulatory and oversight agencies, including those at the federal and state level” to address the situation. The 99 Ranch Market company apologized to its customers for being involved in such an unsafe situation, claiming it is “committed to food safety and customer satisfaction.” Seto and other concerned customers were not convinced with the generic apology and agree that there is reason to be concerned that such an incident may happen again. If the store was negligent enough to allow it to occur once, it could likely be overseen in the future. It is extremely fortunate that Seto had noticed the dangerous meat shipment and was willing to speak up about it. However, it is inexcusable for both 99 Ranch Market and Jim’s Farm Meat to allow such barbaric food handling practices to even be considered. Thankfully, social media was able to inform potential customers of the way that both companies handle their products."
Trump Health And Human Services Secretary Confirmed: “Affordable Care Act Has Failed”,26 JAN 2018,4790,"The position of United States Secretary of Health and Human Services has been vacant since the resignation of Tom Price at the end of September. A month and a half later, President Donald Trump nominated another person for the position, nominating former pharmaceutical executive Alex Azar, who is on record saying that the “Affordable Care Act has failed.” Democrats were not happy about this nomination, and they complained about it for weeks.However, almost two months later, the ‘crucial’ position of Secretary of Health and Human Services is finally being filled, as Alex Azar, in a party-line vote, has finally been approved. Democrats are still unhappy about this appointment, but there is little that they can do, and their disapproval of Alex Azar is hard to square with their claim that the absence of an actual Secretary of Health and Human Services is an impediment to proper governance. Alex Azar has a long history in the medical world. After attaining a Juris Doctorate at Yale, as well as serving on the executive committee of the Harvard Law Review, he spent almost a decade and a half working as a lawyer. In 2001, he entered government service and was confirmed to be the General Counsel for the United States Department of Health and Human Services. As the General Counsel for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Azar played a central role in many emergency situations, including responding to the anthrax attacks of 2001, finding a vaccine for smallpox when bioterrorism became a concern and dealing with the overblown SARS outbreak fears and various influenza outbreaks. In 2005, he was confirmed to be the United States Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, twice unanimously confirmed by the Senate to be the person working directly underneath the position he has now been confirmed for. As he worked under Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt, Azar was responsible for helping to implement government policy, improving government response, and streamlining government processes. After he resigned in 2007 as George W. Bush’s Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, Azar took a job with Eli Lilly, working as their top lobbyist and their spokesman. However, after Barack Obama became President, he left the position, as Eli Lilly wanted a Democrat to be in the position so they would have some rapport with President Obama. Shortly thereafter, Azar became the Vice President of Eli Lilly’s U.S. Managed Healthcare Services organization, a group within Eli Lilly that was dedicated to finding ways to lower the cost of healthcare. In 2012, he was promoted to President of Lilly USA, LLC, and became responsible for the entire of Lilly’s operations in the United States.  He served in that position until he resigned from the company in January 2017. Though Azar has experience in both the private and public sector of the industry of health and human services, one would think he would be a shoe-in for the position. However, Democrats did not care for his policy positions and took every opportunity they could to represent them as absurd or outlandish. The Democrats did not care to hear that Azar would be concentrating on tackling Obamacare as it continues to crumble, nor did they care to hear that he believed that the “Affordable Care Act has failed millions of Americans who have lost the plans they liked and the doctors they liked.” In particular, Virginia Senator and Hillary Clinton’s Vice President nominee Tim Kaine claimed that Azar was dead-set on “sabotaging” the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. According to the Senator, “The Trump administration’s determination to destroy the Affordable Care Act through executive action has destabilized our health care system and threatened coverage for millions,” ignoring that the only thing keeping the Affordable Care Act afloat were executive actions that were likely illegal. Azar was not incapable of defending his position, though, nor was he without supporters. When pressed on Obamacare, he stated that “what I do not support is forcing 6.7 million Americans to pay $3 billion of penalties to not buy something they don’t want to buy through a mandate upon them, 90 percent of whom make $75,000 a year or less.” Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch remembered Azar from his days working with the Bush administration, stating that Azar was and is “one of the best public servants that I’ve seen in the whole time I’ve been here.” Whether Democrats like him or not, Alex Azar is now the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and he has a wealth of experience to draw on. Hopefully, he will be able to improve the health care and insurance system in the United States without repeating the mistakes of the Obama administration."
What Is CHIP? What To Know About The Child Health Care Funding Held Hostage In Government Shutdown,22 JAN 2018,3224,"Families dependent on medical treatment through the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are scared by the government shutdown, which increases the likelihood that states will run out of funds. As Republicans and Democrats battle to blame one another for a historic government shutdown, parents dependent on a child health care program for low-income families are fighting to explain the significance of the key government program being placed in jeopardy. The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides millions of minors in the U.S. with health care coverage even if their parents lack insurance of their own. An estimated 20 states will run out of CHIP money by February 1 if Congress is unable to make a bipartisan deal, according to Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute, based in Washington, D.C. The pending expiration places more than 1.75 million children at risk of losing their health insurance next month. If those children lose their insurance, then they would be unable to receive routine checkups, immunizations, dental care and other emergency services. Congress could have fully funded CHIP in September, but politicians were unable to agree on a source of funding for the program, which serves 9 million children, and its security was delayed. Now, amid the first government shutdown under unified party control, politicians are struggling to place the blame for CHIP’s funding peril on one another. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for viewing health care for needy children as “hostages ripe for the taking,” while Schumer responded that Republicans, who control every federal branch of government, can only blame themselves. He added that “negotiating with this White House is like negotiating with Jell-O. It’s next to impossible.” The government shut down on Friday after the Senate failed to pass a budget bill to continue funding government operations. Some Republicans, like Ohio Senator Rob Portman, had backed a short-term measure that would fund CHIP for a few more months, noting that “nothing in this short-term funding bill that either party opposes,” but the party leaders are deadlocked on long-term solutions for military funding, CHIP and immigration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office revealed weeks before the shutdown that CHIP would save the federal government approximately $6 million if funded for another 10 years. That massive difference is partially due to President Donald Trump’s repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. The repeal made the Health Insurance Marketplace significantly more expensive, so if CHIP disappears, more families will flood that market. The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Colleen Kraft, urged Congress to pass funding for the longest possible duration on behalf of the families dependent on CHIP. “Congressional inaction on CHIP along with a government shutdown is a dangerous combination for families. Taken together, this lack of meaningful action to fund programs so important to children’s health has pediatricians alarmed,” Kraft said in a statement. “This carries real consequences for children and families.” H/T: News Week"
"JUST IN: Paramedics Rush To SCOTUS Home, Serious Health Concerns For Obama Appointed Justice",22 JAN 2018,4784,"Justice Sotomayor experienced symptoms of low blood sugar. Paramedics rushed to the Washington home of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor Friday morning, court officials confirmed. The 63-year-old, who has suffered from type 1 diabetes all her life, was treated for low blood sugar “but was able to go to work afterward,” Kathy Arberg explained. “Justice Sotomayor experienced symptoms of low blood sugar at her home this morning. She was treated by D.C. Emergency Medical Services and is doing fine,” the court spokeswoman announced publicly. “She came to work, resumed her usual schedule, and will be participating in planned activities over the weekend.” One of four left-leaning justices, Sotomayor was appointed by Obama in 2009 and has historically been open and forthcoming about her chronic illness. The first Hispanic justice to serve on the Supreme Court has the more serious version of the condition, which requires her to manage her diabetes “through insulin injections, glucose tablets, and regular testing of her blood sugar.” Since becoming the third woman named to America’s highest court, she has been vocal about “her previous struggles and scares.” As President Trump pointed out, this is not a good thing for someone in her position of responsibility. When interviewed about the possibility of having the opportunity to appoint more justices besides Neil Gorsuch, whom he named to replace Antonin Scalia, the president named Sotomayor as one of three potential candidates for replacement. “If you’re as controlled as I am, that 15 minutes is critical,” Sotomayor says. Anthony Kennedy is rumored to be considering retirement and Ruth Bader Ginsburg isn’t getting any younger, “What does she weigh? 60 pounds?” President Trump asked. His final guess for replacement, “Sotomayor,” President Trump thinks, “Her health. No good. Diabetes.” Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and used to be called “juvenile diabetes.” The body does not create its own insulin, which breaks down sugars and allows the body to absorb glucose. When glucose levels get too low, symptoms range from shakiness and nervousness to seizures and unconsciousness. Sotomayor mentioned her condition in a 2013 interview. “I’m super vigilant when I’m in court,” she told Diabetes Forecast Magazine. “My most obvious sign, which I can’t see, is paleness. If I start feeling any sort of lightness coming on, I immediately check.” Each fall, when her new batch of legal assistant “clerks” arrives, she orients them on ways to recognize if she may be having a medical emergency. “You only have like a 15-minute lead time for the insulin to start working. If you’re as controlled as I am, that 15 minutes is critical.” As President Trump pointed out, this is not a good thing for someone in her position. Glucose tablets are stashed everywhere Sotomayor spends time. “I have tubes in my pocketbook. I have them in my car. I have them in the office. I have them in my travel bag. I have them on the bench. I have them in the judges’ conference room.” During her confirmation hearings, Sotomayor’s diabetes was a huge issue. Complications she could experience, like kidney failure, nerve damage and heart attacks are the most serious. At any time, she could have a stroke, heart attack, or “damage to blood vessels to the eyes, causing blindness.” While “Justice” is supposed to be “blind,” members of the Supreme Court must be able to “discharge the powers and duties” of the job. Speaking to a group of children affected by the disease, Sotomayor related that she “constantly calculates how a meal will affect her.” No matter where she is dining, she will self-inject the needed insulin. “There is many a five-star restaurant that I have shot up at openly,” she admits. She needs about four shots a day. “Occasionally I’m at a place where there are children at another table and I’ve never had a child look away with disgust. I’ve always had children look at it with fascination. Always, if I’m leaving, I’ll walk past the child and say, ‘You saw me giving myself my shot, didn’t you?’ I’ll say to them, ‘I’m a diabetic and I need that medicine before I eat.'” Justice is supposed to be blind but members of the Supreme Court must be able to discharge the powers and duties of the job. One of her biggest assets as a Supreme Court Justice is her power of concentration but it can also be a double-edged sword. “When I’m doing anything, I am totally focused,” she notes. “That can be dangerous if you’re disconnected from feeling what your body is saying. My worst lows have happened in the middle of some activity in which I’ve been really concentrating. It’s still a challenge for me to not ignore, or not to disconnect from, self-monitoring during those intense concentration periods.”"
"Progressive CEO Under Fire As Health Craze Means Company Chucking 138-Year-Old, Most Notable Item",17 JAN 2018,4532,"Mark Schneider, CEO of Nestle, wants to transition toward making healthier products. To start the process, the company sold its entire U.S. candy business, giving up such beloved brands as BabyRuth and Butterfinger. Liberal mania is infecting corporations. Candymakers are being pressured into creating healthier options. Headed by CEO Mark Schneider, Nestle is abandoning its U.S. chocolate business in an attempt to clean up its image. Nestle first started selling chocolate 138 years ago. Our society is flush with its products, you can’t enter an American convenience store without finding a Butterfinger or BabyRuth. But, now Italian chocolatier Ferrero will control the iconic brands. Schneider is already facing heat for his decision. The health craze gripping the left is not what it seems. “While economic concerns remain in the forefront for consumers, health and wellness concerns continue to increase in importance. The reasons vary from societal, demographic, technological, governmental and, most importantly, a shift in consumer focus on the role diet plays in health,” said  James Russo, SVP, Global Consumer Insights at Nielsen. Consumers want access to healthier, ethically-sourced foods, but they also want to pig out on junk food sometimes. America isn’t facing a severe obesity epidemic because consumers are too focused on health. Nestle sold its U.S. chocolate business to Fererro for a whopping $2.8 billion.  “More than 3 million tons of cocoa beans are consumed worldwide annually… Global demand continues to rise, in part due to increasing demand from emerging markets for confectionery. The overall chocolate market rose 13 percent between 2010 and 2015 to hit $101 billion,” writes CNBC. Is Nestle making a financial mistake? According to Reuters, “Tuesday’s deal only accounts for about 1 percent of Nestle’s sales, but is part of a larger shake-up by chief executive Schneider, a healthcare industry veteran one year into the job.” One percent is obviously a minuscule part of its sales, but many industry experts believe that that the market will surpass $100 billion in yearly sales. If Nestle focused on revamping their image and enticing new costumers, the company could increase sales enough to justify holding on to the chocolate business.  “After the recent surges in the prices of cocoa and sugar, we think that prices are likely to fall back a little from currently high levels,” Hamish Smith, commodities economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC via email. “While lower prices can be expected to benefit producers in terms of cheaper production costs, raw commodity costs tend to be a relatively small share of overall costs of goods such as chocolate (other costs include labor, transport, packaging and marketing). Healthy eating is important, but most people like to indulge at least occasionally. Despite persistent concerns that they sold the confectionary business too early, it’s hard to argue that Nestle’s deal won’t be useful in the short-term. “The chocolate business, which it is selling for $2.8 billion, has about $900 million in sales… the deal represents a multiple of roughly 20.7 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization,” CNBC notes. Schneider was in part motivated by a desire to avoid competitors. In the U.S., Nestle’s sales trail behind Hershey, Mars Inc, and Lindt. “The switch of assets makes a lot of sense,“ Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said of the move. ”You’re going out of a weak business in terms of financials and … entering a market with strong growth and higher margins.” Schneider has indicated that he plans to lead Nestle away from chocolate and toward vitamins.   In addition to health concerns, many people are troubled by the way large companies source their cocoa. Nestle, along with every other candy giant, has had to defend itself numerous times. Hershey, which owns Nestle’s KitKat sales in the U.S, is one of the biggest candy companies in the world. “No company sourcing cocoa from (Ivory Coast) can guarantee they have completely removed the risk of children working on small farms in their supply chain. Nestle is no different, but we are determined to tackle the problem,” the Swiss food and beverage company said in a 2015 statement. The chocolate industry is rife with problems, and Nestle’s U.S. chocolate sale represent a minuscule part of the company’s revenues. However, they abandoned the effort too soon. Chocolate is still popular, there’s a way that Nestle can appeal to consumers if it tried."
Reporter’s Mental Health Under Suspicion After Odd Press Pool Behavior Demonstrates Delusion,17 JAN 2018,2482,"CNN’s Acosta mental health now big question after press briefing. After White House Physician Dr. Ronny Jackson revealed Tuesday that President Donald Trump was very healthy and mentally fit for office, many are now questioning CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s mental health after his odd behavior during the briefing. Perhaps displaying signs of delusion, Acosta suggested Jackson was withholding information about Trump’s health from reporters. “One question,” Acosta asked. “There isn’t anything that’s part of the president’s health records or his overall physical fitness or any medications that he’s taking that you’re not permitted to tell us? Is there anything you’re keeping from us for privacy reasons?” Acosta, who has peddled utterly groundless claims that Trump was mentally unfit for office, couldn’t believe the president’s physical didn’t produce any negative results. Jackson told Acosta that no information has been withheld from reporters, putting a swift end to the endless barrage of leftist conspiracy theories about Trump’s health. “I can promise there is nothing that I am withholding from you. I can tell you, I’ve done the last four or five of these,” Jackson replied. “I’ve been involved in probably the last six or seven of these and this is hands down more information that has been put forth by any other assessment to date.” Check out Jackson’s full briefing below, with Acosta’s bizarre theories beginning at that 22:10 mark: During his hour-long briefing, Jackson made it clear that Trump is “exceptionally healthy,” passed his cognitive test with a “perfect score,” and has “incredible genes.” Jackson, who also medically oversaw and advised former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, also said that Trump asked him to administer an additional cognitive test, which is not required as a part of his overall physical. Trump got a perfect score of 30/30 on his cognitive test, proving that he very well may be more of a stable genius than the reporters who scream and throw temper tantrums every single day. Acosta’s delusional actions have lead many to question his mental capacity given he floated a conspiracy theory that Jackson was lying and withholding information from the press about Trump’s health. He and his fake news network can’t fathom that the president is mentally well. Now that we know Trump’s completely healthy, what crazy conspiracy theory about Trump will liberals come up with next?

"Government Issues Transgender Healthcare Update, Biology Discounted As Move Infuriates Leftists",16 JAN 2018,5670,"Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, is also in charge of the administration of the National Health Service (NHS). This means that it is under his watch that this ridiculous pamphlet was printed and the new policy of appeasing transgender individuals to the detriment of their health was begun. The British National Health Service has been under fire lately as it has suffered through various scandals, including the cancellation of 50,000 procedures because they were unable to deal with a flu outbreak. But now, a combination of social justice pandering and national ‘single-payer’ health care in England has led to the government-controlled healthcare system making an absurd decision to pander to people who ‘feel’ like they are men, even if they are genetically and biologically women. According to a newly-released pamphlet from the English NHS, a pamphlet called ‘information for trans people – NHS screening programmes,’ ‘trans people’ who identify as men will not receive notifications or invitations for certain services.  Those services, cervical examinations and breast examinations, are important medical services that can help prevent cervical and breast cancer or catch them before they progress and spread, saving money, pain, and time. The basis for the change to the ‘programmes’ is the desire to avoid offending transgender individuals by allowing them to register as whatever sex they like. Therefore, when an individual born as a woman registers as a male, the NHS records show them only as a male, even though they have a cervix and breasts and do not have a prostate. One of many hospitals in the NHS systems, most of which underperform. However, with this recent decision to allow people to choose their gender, hospitals like this one will experience slightly less need for preventative care. Therefore, when the NHS sends out its computer-automated invitations to screenings, those individuals who were born as women but now ‘identify’ and are registered as male won’t get those invitations. On the positive side, however, the NHS will likely offer them prostate exams when they are in the appropriate age range, so individuals who ‘feel’ that they are a certain sex will be able to have their feelings protected while being offered wholly useless medical procedures. To be fair to the NHS pamphlet, it does state that people should come into the NHS system for appropriate exams for whatever body parts they have, no matter what they may ‘identify’ as.  However, the NHS decision to send out ‘invitations’ for exams that the patient does not actually need seems to be risking actual health to protect ‘feelings,’ and to avoid offending patients by pointing out the medical reality that someone who has spent NHS money on hormone treatment and even surgeries still has all the parts they were born with and is still prone to all the medical afflictions of their birth sex. Conservative British MP David Davies released a statement to local outlets, saying that “this NHS effort to be politically correct is putting the lives of women who claim to be men at risk,” and continued on to say that it is “wasting the time of men who claim to be women by offering them tests for organs they do not have.” Even woman’s rights advocates, such as Laura Perrins, said that it was wasteful, stating that “it’s a ludicrous use of NHS resources to invite men for a cervical smear test, while it’s immoral and dangerous not to invite women.” The National Health Service system often finds itself hanging on by a thread. During the Christmas season in 2017, they were swamped by people with the flu and had to cancel more than 50,000 procedures that patients had been waiting for (some for months) so that they could keep up with the demands on the system due to the flu. This is the obvious outcome when feelings are believed to be more important than science; eventually, countries and their health systems begin to decide that they would rather play along with the politically correct game, rather than risk lawsuits for ‘misgendering’ individuals. However, this decision could also lead to litigation risks, as those individuals being pandered to may be more prone to missing important medical procedures that could prevent them from developing serious illnesses. If there is a positive for the British National Health Service, however, it is that by not automatically sending appropriate notices to clients who need specific medical procedures, they may lessen the strain on the system to provide appropriate medical care. In other words, by sending notices to people to remind them that they can receive care that they don’t actually have a use for, they may save themselves money and ration care away from ‘transgendered’ individuals. This will also likely serve to lower the already unusually low life expectancy for such individuals. Trans activists around the world demand that they be treated as if they are whatever new gender they claim they are on any particular day. However, when this collides with the medical fact that hormone treatment doesn’t change the body as drastically as they would like to believe, a choice must be made. England chose to ignore biological reality to pander to political correctness. It is rare that one ‘single-payer’ health system manages to provide so wonderful an example of the ills of both socialized medicine and political correctness, but the British NHS has accomplished that lofty goal. This pamphlet and the willingness of the NHS to pander to the delusional will only end with a lessened standard of care and worse outcomes for an already tragically mediocre healthcare system."
"2,000 In One Week, Health Officials Warn Highly Contagious Outbreak At 7-Eleven Not Contained",9 JAN 2018,4282,"Salt Lake County Health Department Executive Director Gary Edwards explains the value of getting the hepatitis A shot. In a small Utah 7-Eleven, an employee made a colossal error that could spell disaster. Over the course of a work week, this employee came to work not feeling well. Between December 26 and January 3 this sick employee exposed at least 2,000 people to hepatitis A. This recent exposure is part of a much larger outbreak in the area. Local health officials link this current outbreak to a sudden increase in cases that date back to August. Hepatitis A is extremely contagious, and it can appear to be a case of the flu or another virus. In the case of this 7-Eleven, something as simple as a sick employee coming into work started a chain of exposures. The virus is spread by close contact with an infected person or someone coming into contact with tainted food or liquids. For example, an outbreak at a cafe is more often than not tied to small levels of infected fecal matter in the food. The worker at 7-Eleven came to the store sick and due to something as simple as inadequate handwashing exposed customers. The local health authority warned that customers using the bathroom in the store or buying food prepared on-site were at risk. According to a press release from the local health department: “Customers who used the restroom or consumed a fountain drink, fresh fruit or food from the hot food case should contact the county health department to get information about receiving a preventive hepatitis A injection. Prepackaged items don’t pose a risk of exposure.” The health department is cautioning anyone who may have been exposed to get a preventive injection to stop the spread of the virus. It is far better for everyone involved to treat the possible virus exposer than to wait to see if symptoms arise. The vaccination is a single shot and should block the virus. For the most part, the shot is available to anyone who asks for it. In the local Utah area, the health department has a supply on hand. There are some limited concerns about the shot supply running low with each new exposure, so officials suggest getting the vaccination as early as possible. They have also asked that the information about the 7-Eleven outbreak be shared widely to hopefully reach as many people as possible. Based on sales data for the store, the company estimated that up to 2,000 customers could have come into contact with the virus. Currently, they have treated about 300 people with the preventative shot. With only 300 of the 2,000 exposed customers vaccinated, it seems there are far more out there that may end up with hepatitis A. On its own, the virus is not usually life-threatening. It can be treated, and this includes making sure to avoid things like dehydration. Dehydration can be a deadly outcome of the infection. Symptoms of the virus usually surface weeks after exposure. It is still possible to get the shot to stop the virus within the first two weeks of exposure. Hepatitis A is caused by a virus and is very easy to pass from one person to the next. Unlike the other strains of hepatitis, this does not appear to do long-term damage in most of the people who end up with the virus. It is a virus that affects the liver and has some very uncomfortable symptoms. These symptoms include: “Fatigue
Sudden nausea and vomiting
Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially on the upper right side beneath your lower ribs (by your liver)
Clay-colored bowel movements
Loss of appetite
Low-grade fever
Dark urine
Joint pain
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
Intense itching” For some, the symptoms are very mild and only last a few weeks. For others, the symptoms can last a month or more with much more of an impact on overall health. Factors like age and other health issues can make this virus much harder for a body to fight. Young children and the elderly run the risk for significant complications from the illness. One of the reasons officials are focusing on prevention is the fact that there is no real treatment to cure hepatitis A. Doctors can help manage the impact of the virus but once symptoms set in the patient just needs to let it run its course. This can be a few weeks or even up to 6 months in severe cases."
"JUST IN: Social Healthcare Ruin, 50,000 Surgeries Axed As “Third World” Conditions Exposed",8 JAN 2018,6024,"Jeremy Hunt, the current head of the National Health Service, has a hard job to manage. His organization is responsible for spending a full third of the budget of the British government, but their health outcomes remain terrible. Sadly, if this crisis is any indication, he is not doing well at improving the system. As the 2018 elections come closer, expect to hear more and more from Democrat candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and Socialist candidates like ‘Independent’ Bernie Sanders about the beauty of a single-payer healthcare system. It’s a favorite Democrat talking point during election time, and it’s an easy sell to their base who routinely demand that they are afforded things at others’ expense. However, all this talk of the utopian wonders of single-payer healthcare leaves out the realities of such a system. These are realities that England experienced anew as the British National Health Service ordered the cancellation of 50,000 ‘non-essential’ surgeries. The National Health Service mandated its order early Tuesday, January 2, 2018, as hospitals across the country struggled to meet medical demands related to an outbreak of the winter flu. According to witness accounts, English hospitals were overwhelmed, with some patients forced to wait for up to twelve hours to receive medical care.  Furthermore, as seating in the waiting rooms filled, some patients were forced to stand. Waiting to be seen by a doctor in a British emergency room usually requires a wait of three to six hours. Most tests and procedures require further waiting still. One doctor claimed to be providing ‘battlefield medicine’ to patients suffering flu symptoms, and other doctors pointed out that the hospitals were providing ‘third-world conditions’ as the staff became unable to cope with the demand for their services. Eventually, the only thing that the NHS could conceive of was to cancel surgeries and reassign the manpower to other functions. Theresa May, the current British Prime Minister, made a statement on Thursday, saying “I know it’s difficult, I know it’s frustrating, I know it’s disappointing for people and I apologize,” as she went to a London-area hospital and visited patients languishing there while waiting for their appointments. Britain’s National Healthcare Service and the system that it oversees rarely performs well. Hospitals are short-staffed, under-equipped, and lagging behind other nations.  Britain’s cancer survival rates are atrocious, and often on par with third-world countries and former Soviet satellite states. In general, their hospitals are in poor condition, and many of their most talented medical professionals flee to the United States or elsewhere. Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has no answers. The National Health Service and its single-payer waste of money have become so ingrained in the U.K. political scene that talk of reform is toxic to political ambitions. It’s shocking to see how little the United Kingdom is able to get out of a healthcare system that they spend a third of their budget on every year. Apparently, one-third of Britain’s annual budget only buys them a single-payer healthcare system that is on par with Chile and Poland when it comes to cancer outcomes. Single-payer is not some utopian healthcare system; quite the contrary, it kills healthcare systems. There’s a reason that the United States produces the vast majority of all new procedures, medications, and other medical innovations in any given year. In socialist and communist nations, cash-strapped healthcare systems are barely capable of meeting the demands for actual healthcare, let alone expanding the world’s medical knowledge base. Those 50,000 patients whose procedures were just suddenly canceled have no recourse but to wait until the government can give them another appointment. This means that people waiting for life-saving and important procedures may be waiting for weeks, or even months, until the National Health Service can find a new time slot for them. The United Kingdom had to cancel 50,000 appointments and procedures across the country, which has a popular of 55 million people, because the flu season overloaded their health system. A better example of the failings of single-payer, one could not think of. Another interesting problem that arrives from single-payer healthcare systems is that people, especially those prone to hypochondria, no longer feel the need to be responsible about the care that they seek. When they have to pay the bill, they’re less likely to run to the hospital with a cold or the flu (both of which, in most cases, the hospital can do little about). In other words, when people have to pay for healthcare, even if it is only a modest amount, they tend to be better stewards of that access. They think more about whether or not they actually need health care, or if they just have something minor wrong with them. If American citizens doubt that single-payer systems are generally awful, they can look at the Department of Veteran Affairs here in the United States to see how easily such a system can fail. Compounding that failure, the VA has a very limited set of illnesses it treats, for a very specific subset of American citizens, and it still cannot manage to function. Two states in the United States have recently considered single-payer healthcare systems. Vermont, Bernie Sanders’ home state, considered operating their own single-payer healthcare system but abandoned the plan when it became obvious the expense would be too great. California, never one to balk at absurd spending, is still attempting to make such a plan work, even after finding out that at best, a single-payer system in California would double the state’s annual budget. Single-payer healthcare is not a utopia, despite what Bernie ‘I think bread lines are great’ Sanders may say. It’s a quick way to destroy a healthcare system to the point where a minor illness like the flu can cause the system to grind to a halt."
Yale Mental Health Hype: Author Admits “Dangerous” Falsehoods As Trump Claims Recanted,8 JAN 2018,2568,"Dr. Lee has been exposed for lying about a key meeting to support her claims. A Yale University psychiatry professor claimed has met with lawmakers to discuss President Donald Trump’s mental health is now walking back a major claim as her credibility is crumbling under public scrutiny. Dr. Bandy Lee secretly met with a dozen Democratic members of Congress in December to discuss their theories that Trump wasn’t mentally fit to hold office. When she began speaking with liberals in the media to push her completely unfounded conspiracy theory, Lee initially claimed that a Republican senator attended the meeting to show that there was bipartisan support for challenging Trump’s mental health. During an interview with the Weekly Standard, she claimed she met with the GOP senator in a Senate office building on December 5, but refused to say if she met with the senator in the hallway or in a closed door meeting. Dr. Bandy Lee is now peddling falsehoods that Trump is mentally unfit for office. After being pressed for answers by the Weekly Standard, Lee admitted that the “meeting” was “accidental” and “incidental,” and took place in a public hallway with dozens of tourists and other people. “It wasn’t arranged in advance,” Dr. Bandy Lee confessed to the Weekly Standard. “It was accidental. It was incidental.” “I won’t comment. I’m sorry,” Lee said. Asked directly by the Weekly Standard if the GOP senator agreed with her insane assessment that Trump was unfit for office, Lee said: “No. I mean, they engaged us, but that’s about it.” So Lee admitted that she never met with a Republican congressman who agreed with her unverified assessment. It’s important to note that Lee has never met with Trump face-to-face to make any scientifically sound determination of his mental state, but now she is working with Democrats to claim Trump should be unfit for office. Trump is a counter puncher, and these leftist are getting exposed for peddling lies. Her utterly insane and incompetent remarks follow author Michael Wolff’s new book, titled, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” where the liberal made a slew of claims that have already been proven to be completely false. Wolff’s tabloid gossip cast significant doubt on the credibility of the erroneous claims he made in his book, which has been refuted by many who are quoted in the book. Both Wolff and Lee have been elevated by the mainstream media in recent weeks to levy attacks against Trump, where both discredited leftists are pushing lies to derail Trump’s presidency.

"Obama Refugee Deal UPHELD, Military Aged Middle Eastern Men With ‘Mental Health’ Issues Welcome",28 DEC 2017,4795,"Obama made a deal with Australia that allows them to send in a group of mentally ill foreign nationals from third world countries into the United States. These men are of fighting age and have wreaked havoc in the communities around their detention camps in Australia. President Trump has neglected to address a plan in place that will allow Australia to dump 1,250 mentally ill people from third world countries into the United States. The 1,250 “refugees” will be resettled throughout our country and the United Stated will get nothing in return. These people are currently in detention centers and have proven themselves to be so violent and destructive Australia insist they be expelled from their nation. These “refugees” are mostly adult single men, many of whom are of fighting age and chose to flee their countries rather than to defend them. They are cowards who abandoned their people and nations out of greed and lust for the wealth and comfort of western nations. They have a propensity for crime and seek only to take advantage of our flawed immigration system posing as refugees. Some 54 of the mentally ill Middle Easterners have already arrived on our soil, and hundreds more will be on the way after January 12. According to the New York Times these refugees all have “acute mental health problems” which means they will not be able to contribute to our nation in any meaningful way. They will be just another horde of immigrants draining our social welfare systems living off the fruits of Americans labor. Australians don’t want these immigrants in their country so they intend to ship them to the United States. Australia has made their intentions clear, they will be shipped out of their country whether or not the United States takes them in. The Australian Director for Human Rights Watch Elaine Pearson said, “If the U.S. isn’t going to accept people from certain countries, they should make that crystal clear now so Australia can make alternative arrangements…There is no time to waste- these refugees have acute mental health problems made worse by years of uncertainty and insecurity on Manus and Nauru (Islands in Australia where they are currently in detention centers). A girl was brutally raped by one of the inmates in the detention center in January. The attack was so vicious when she finally escaped she bled so profusely she lost consciousness en route desperately fleeing toward her family’s residence. The Sri Lanka national who raped the high school girl claims to be a “refugee.” Rapes are a common practice of these people that Australia is pushing into the United States. A young girl the age of ten was brutally raped by a Pakistani national from the detention center. The 28 year old man who repeatedly rapped the young girl was charged with four counts of sexual penetration of a child. The Pakistani “refugee” caused outrage and the Manus MP and government minister said, “I demand they secure these people and remove them forthwith before our local people massacre them.” This is the detention center on Manus Island and is filled with fighting age men claiming to be “refugees.” These depraved criminals sometimes act in groups to perpetrate their heinous crimes. Three of the “refugees” were caught leading a small boy, five years of age into the detention center. If the three men had not been caught the boy may have suffered the same tragic fate as other victims of the detention center detainees. The immigration minister Peter Dutton said, “There was concern about why he was being led or for what purpose he was being led back away into the regional processing center.” The people living in proximity to the detention center have had enough of their savage behavior, and now plan to ship them to the United States. They suffer from many mental conditions and have committed an array of criminally insane behavior. Bringing these people into our nation to live in our communities would be a grave mistake and pose a serious danger to Americans and their families. Obama made the deal with Australia to settle these people in our nation. This is one of many examples of how the Obama administration often showed little regard for the safety of Americans. President Trump promised to end such dangerous refugee deals, however, Trump has not spoken up to halt this absurd arrangement to date. If the president doesn’t act soon these criminals will be settled in our neighborhoods wreaking havoc on our communities and endangering our children. Americans will be forced to pay for their housing, and medical care. These people are not “refugees” and they do not belong in our country, Trump must force Australia to make those “alternative arrangements.” This is the Nauru detention center filled with fighting age men claiming to be “refugees.”"
Agency Responsible For Protecting Health Fails As Water Fountains Spew Unthinkable,18 DEC 2017,2571,"Dan Becker (pictured), director of the Safe Climate Campaign, has quite the irony on his hands as his title implies something different that the news that he faces about fountains at the EPA. Those who say that the government does everything so much better than the private sector does are sure to be quite shocked by how wrong such thinking is. As if often the case, the things that we allow the government to do are often the very things which get done the worst. We have seen it with the Department of Education, for instance, as American children perform well below the standards of other nations. Today, the Conservative Daily Post has shown that another huge fail has happened as the Environmental Protection Agency (who presidential candidate Ron Paul wisely wanted to abolish) allowed “actual sewage” to gush from “it’s fountains.” As Vice writes, a “water back up” was causing an “issue” with the fountains, according to an E&E newsletter. “A sewer problem at EPA HQ has resulted in poop exploding out of water fountains,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign bluntly. That will an unappetizing thought the next time that someone takes a sip from those fountains in the future. https://twitter.com/safeclimatecamp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconservativetribune.com%2Fagency-clean-water-sewage%2F “Sometimes there were some very odd smells coming out of those drinking fountains,” an administrator admitted to E&E. “I can’t imagine that anyone would actually drink out of those drinking water fountains. I think I used it to pour my coffee down.” That is great for those who know about it. However, what happens during those days when the smell is not that ripe and visitors have a nice gulp of rotten water? This agency has been one that is beholden to the lie of global warming and they have hounded landowners (like the Bundys) time and time again for simply utilizing their property. Most of what the EPA does caters to a liberal worldview that damages progress and upward mobility for everyone. Their yoke is heavy and it costs the average person quite a bit of money everytime that they use the heat or the air in their homes. Trump had it right about this agency. The only good news to be found is that many staffers at the agency are said to have quite since President Donald Trump took office and began doing things correctly. Hopefully, many more will quit. At some point, in theory, there will be no one at the agency at all. In such a world, America would be much better off. Source: The Conservative Daily Post – Vice"
Health Department To You: Step Away From Your Smartphone,15 DEC 2017,1577,"Health department has issued guidelines to reduce risk of radiation exposure. SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The California Department of Public Health is urging you to keep your smartphone away from your body and out of your pocket as much as possible. Smartphones emit radiation when they send and receive signals to and from cell towers. And, according to some scientists and health officials, research suggests long-term, heavy use may impact your health. “Although the science is still evolving, there are concerns among some public health professionals and members of the public regarding long-term, high use exposure to the energy emitted by cell phones,” said CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Karen Smith. “We know that simple steps, such as not keeping your phone in your pocket and moving it away from your bed at night, can help reduce exposure for both children and adults.” About 95 percent of Americans own a cell phone, according to CDPH, and 12 percent use their smartphones for everyday internet access. Kids are also getting their first smartphones around age 10, often keeping them by their beds at night and nearby most of the day. “Children’s brains develop through the teenage years and may be more affected by cell phone use,” said Smith. “Parents should consider reducing the time their children use cell phones and encourage them to turn the devices off at night.” The scientific community has not yet reached a consensus on the risk, but the health department has issued guidelines to reduce risk of radiation exposure. They include: H/T: ABC13"
California Health Report Creates Panic As 95 Percent Of Americans Impacted,14 DEC 2017,4348,"California health department chief Dr. Karen Smith believes that people need to take more precautions when using cell phones. The devices are thought to cause cancer with prolonged usage. Beware the dangers of cell phones. It sounds like a setup for a Stephen King novel, but concerns over increased cell phone usage are growing. The California health department warns people to take precautions to protect themselves. The danger is in the microwaves. Cell phones use radiofrequency (RF) waves, a potentially dangerous version of radiation. Pressing a phone to your face allows the waves to penetrate your skin and wreak havoc.   “Children’s brains develop through the teenage years and may be more affected by cell phone use… Parents should consider reducing the time their children use cell phones and encourage them to turn the devices off at night,” California state health officer Dr. Karen Smith said. Doctors are urging people to take precautions. Too much exposure to RF waves can lead to cancer, or other abnormalities. Keep your phone away from your bed; don’t stash it in your pocket; keep conversations to a reasonable time limit. “We know that simple steps, such as not keeping your phone in your pocket and moving it away from your bed at night, can help reduce exposure for both children and adults,” said Dr. Smith. Technology is racing ahead at breakneck speed. Health officials can’t keep up with new risks that we’re constantly being exposed to. 95% of Americans have a cell phone, and most people use them every day. Radiation from cell phones goes directly into your brain. The waves pierce through your skin and affect your health. Further clouding the issue, not all side-effects are bad. “I think if a person experiences a temporary loss of vision in one eye, that’s potentially a very important problem for which they should seek medical attention,” Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. Dean Wingerchuk said. “But, it doesn’t always mean there’s an abnormality.” Researchers have to differentiate between the risks involved with staring at an electronic screen for too long and the dangers of RF waves. People have been regularly using cell phones since the 90’s. If prolonged use leads to cancer, there hasn’t been enough time to detect it. “In a way, we’ve all unwittingly become part of an uncontrolled population-wide experiment on cell phone safety,” said leading natural health practitioner Chris Kesser. “And the precautionary principle applies — we don’t know that it’s harmful, but it makes sense to take reasonable measures to reduce exposure in case it is.” Experiments on animals have been largely inconclusive. Exposure to radiation obviously doesn’t help a mammalian body survive, the damaging effects can be hard to see. One study examined rats, blasting them with constant RF waves. “I was surprised because there had been so many studies before that had pretty consistently not shown elevations in cancer,” said David Carpenter, director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the State University of New York at Albany. “In retrospect, the reason for that is nobody maintained a sufficient number of animals for a sufficient amount of time to get results like this.” Cell phones have dramatically altered our culture. If the common devices turn out to be deadly, it would be disastrous. Simple precautions can slash your risk of getting sick from your phone. According to the American Cancer Society: “The RF waves from cell phones come from the antenna, which is part of the body of a hand-held phone. The waves are strongest at the antenna and lose energy quickly as they travel away from the phone. The phone is typically held against the side of the head when in use. The closer the antenna is to the head, the greater a person’s expected exposure to RF energy. The body tissues closest to the phone absorb more energy than tissues farther away..” Children face the biggest risk. Their brains and bodies aren’t as equipped to defend themselves as adults. Parents who don’t want to limit their own cell phone use might want to monitor that of their children. “The rate of microwave radiation absorption is higher in children than adults because their brain tissues are more absorbent, their skulls are thinner, and their relative size is smaller,” reads a report from the Environmental Health Trust."
Health Department Says The Flu Is Running Rampant In New York,14 DEC 2017,853,"The agency says there have been over 1,800 confirmed cases of influenza in 54 counties and all boroughs of New York City. ALBANY — The state Health Department says influenza is now prevalent in New York state, which means health care workers who haven’t had a flu shot must wear procedural masks around patients. Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker says everyone over 6 months old is encouraged to get a flu shot as soon as possible. He says the vaccine is especially important for people at high risk of complications from flu, including children under 2, pregnant women and adults over 65. The agency says there have been over 1,800 confirmed cases of influenza in 54 counties and all boroughs of New York City. More than 600 required hospitalization. Influenza season typically runs from October through May, often peaking in February. H/T: NY Post"
Fraud And Deception Alleged In Class Action Lawsuit Against Teachers Health Trust,13 DEC 2017,2295,"Class action lawsuit. LAS VEGAS (KTNV) – We count on them to teach and care for our children every day. But in many cases, they cannot care for themselves. “Medication is not affordable and access to care is not available,” Clark County School District teacher Sheri DeBartolo told Darcy Spears in May. DeBartolo has since left CCSD in order to get more reliable health insurance. “And it’s very difficult and it’s very frustrating,” said former CCSD school psychologist Diana Goodsell, who also quit CCSD over inadequate healthcare. Goodsell, DeBartolo and CCSD Special Education Facilitator Paul Feaker are spearheading the lawsuit against Teachers Health Trust, its administrator, WellHealth, and its board of directors for negligence, fraud and deception. “When you purchase a product, especially a health insurance product, you expect to have your medical claims paid,” said Attorney Matthew Callister, whose firm is representing the plaintiffs. According to the lawsuit, Teachers Health Trust routinely denies valid medical claims and charges sky high co-pays. CCSD educators often have to choose between paying out of pocket or not getting care. After Diana Goodsell was side-swiped in a car accident, she was forced to delay a needed cervical spinal fusion surgery when her entire year’s out-of-pocket expense was demanded up front. “It was $6,800 in one lump sum.” She says she didn’t find that out until the morning of the surgery when she was being admitted. “It was shocking to me that there would be any kind of average family that worked for the school district–or even the average family in this valley–that could afford to pay that much to have a needed surgery.” The lawsuit also says teachers are being turned away by doctors, even “sued by providers WellHealth refused to pay.” “I can’t fathom the fact that we can treat people so poorly who do so much for the kids in this community, and do so little to make sure that they’re taken care of, and really to the point of putting people and families on the brink of medical bankruptcy.” The school district says it provided a $9 million-dollar bailout to the Teachers Health Trust in 2016, but the trust paid 100,000 fewer claims last year than the year before. The class action could cover an estimated 30,000 people. H/T: KTNV"
“They Have Ruined My Health”: Appeal Court Upholds Community Ban Against Couple,12 DEC 2017,2456,"Hermine Ricketts and her husband Tom Carroll just want to grow their vegetables. Hermine Ricketts and her husband Tom Carroll never imagined they would have to argue for their right to grow vegetables. That is exactly what they are doing however since the community they live in has banned them from having a garden in their front yard.  This week Florida’s 3rd District Court of Appeals upheld the ban, shutting another door for the couple. The two live in Miami Shores and a village ordinance restricts the growing of edible plants to the backyard. The couple argues that they should have rights on their own property. Ricketts believes this is just a case of government overreach; “That’s what government does – interferes in people’s lives. We had that garden for 17 years. We ate fresh meals every day from that garden. Since the village stepped its big foot in it, they have ruined our garden and my health.”
 Is this garden really an eyesore for the community? The ban began in 2013 and the couple was forced to dig up their garden or face a $50 a day fine. The two claim they cannot grow the vegetables in their backyard due to a lack of sufficient sun. The Institute for Justice, a non-profit law firm is assisting them in their fight. Lawyer Ari Bargil states; “This decision gives local governments tremendous leeway to regulate harmless activities in the name of aesthetics. It gives government the power to prohibit homeowners from growing plants in their front yards simply because they intend to eat them.”
 The court sided with Miami Shores under the idea that they have the right to control design and landscaping standards in order to protect the appearance of the village. The control also aims to preserve “property values and the enjoyment of property rights by minimizing and reducing conflicts among various land uses.”
 The story has made news all over the country. Ricketts says the village is going too far; “What is the definition of edible? I can go into any front yard and find something edible because every plant has an edible part. Miami Shores claims to promote green living. What could be more green than walking out your front door and picking what you’ve grown rather than driving to the store and buying what has been trucked in, in quantities that contribute to food waste?”
 Ricketts and Carroll have no intention of giving up their fight. They plan to proceed to the Florida Supreme Court next.

Watch: Jimmy Kimmel Makes Another Emotional Plea For Children’s Health Care,12 DEC 2017,1271,"Jimmy Kimmel while holding his 7-month-old son Billy. Jimmy Kimmel has issued another emotional plea for viewers to get involved in protecting affordable access to health care. While holding his 7-month-old son Billy, who underwent a second heart surgery last week after being born with congenital heart disease, the late-night host discussed the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Monday night. The program is in jeopardy because Congress failed to secure funding in October. According to the Washington Post, CHIP provides low-cost health care to 9 million children across the country. “Overwhelmingly, Democrats and Republicans supported it until now. Now CHIP has become a bargaining chip. It’s on the back-burner while [Congress] works out their new tax plans. So that means parents of children with cancer and diabetes and heart problems are about to get letters saying their coverage could be cut off next month,” Kimmel said. He then slammed representatives in Washington D.C. for failing to secure funding for such a crucial program and encouraged viewers to get involved. “I don’t know what could be more disgusting than putting a tax cut that goes to rich people ahead of the lives of children,” Kimmel said.

State Cites “Public Health” As Massive Gun Collection Operation Heralded As Solution,11 DEC 2017,5213,"Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. praising the Goods for Guns program for its “public health” contribution. The Leominster Police Department in Worcester County, Massachusetts will host a gun buy-back event to help its citizens disarm themselves for the sake of “public health.” On December 16, “Goods for Guns” will be held at the police department, encouraging firearm owners to surrender unwanted guns. The programs will offer gift cards in exchange for the following: $25 for long guns, $50 for handguns, and $75 for semi-automatics. While commendable to be proactively considering the public’s safety, programs such as these send the wrong attitude to the community to disarm against potential threats. They are often effective, however, since the events are sponsored by highly regarded community services. The Massachusetts event will be put on by the UMass Memorial Hospital and the Worcester District Attorney office. Benefitting from their titles, officials heading these organizations can use such buy-back events to advocate for gun control once again. The medical director for Worcester’s Division of Public Health, Dr. Michael Hirsh said, “This isn’t just about crime. It’s about public health.” In reality, however, this does not do much for public safety at all. Dr. Hirsh and others pushing these programs are failing to see the actual link between armed citizens and crime prevention. Advertising buy-backs lets potential criminals know that after the sixteenth of December, fewer community households will be able to defend themselves. The goal of getting weapons out of the hands of dangerous criminals will never be accomplished by a community buy-back. Potential perpetrators are not going to give up their weapons so easily and especially not for such a measly trade-off. Gun buy-backs take firearms away from willing law-abiding citizens. Rather, as expected, the event will only attract law-abiding citizens, looking to take advantage of the service. Goods for Guns will also be accepting any other gun-related items that community members may wish to have taken off their hands. No gift cards will be awarded, but individuals can also drop off “non-operable guns, live ammunition, and firearm accessories.” Faulty guns can obviously be hazardous, but ammo and accessories cannot be dangerous if used on their own. Yet, the police is making it seem like this is a disposal service for some sort of hazardous waste. Another negative side to gun buy-backs is that some citizens could even take advantages of programs by trying to get something in return for a gun which, appears operable, but when firing, proves faulty. At some events with more profitable return incentives, citizens have traded in homemade guns in exchange for a value greater than the gun itself. Controversy aside, this will be Goods for Guns seventeenth year. The police boast about how many guns they have relieved citizens of and “returned to law enforcement”: over 2,500 total. Return is an odd word to use about a Constitutional right unless it was borrowed in the first place. The annual event, however, is supposed to make citizens feel safer with fewer firearms on the streets. Unfortunately, buy-back events are most effective at disarming the community, rather than criminals, decreasing overall public safety. Unfortunately, however, this is not the first or last community to fool its citizens into willingly disarming themselves. In July this year, New Jersey held a buy-back for actual cash that the collected over 4,000 firearms total, including what law enforcement is calling “assault weapons.” Even more horrifying, is that none of the guns “returned” will be tested for utility, but were promptly “melted down.” Second Amendment proponents have suggested a compromise as a way for community officials to use buy-backs to increase public safety without disarming “law-abiding people who live in high-crime neighborhoods.” Buy-backs could collect unwanted firearms to be re-distributed to areas where citizens may require personal protection. However, the left does permit this idea to potentially save innocent lives if they immediately destroy perfectly good firearms. Not all buy-back events are a success, however. In 2015, Boston held a “Your Piece for Peace” buy-back which only yielded a single firearm for the entire event. It is unclear whether police simply did not accept all firearms offered, or if citizens were rightfully not willing to part with their defense. In any case, the Commissioner of the Boston Police Department, William Evans said, “If we get one gun off the street…” Coincidentally, that is all the buy-back accomplished. Firearms which could otherwise be used as defense against crime are collected at gun buy-backs and often destroyed. While this undeniably makes the community a much more dangerous place to roam and reside in, officials and gun-control advocates will have the false satisfaction of ensuring the safety of citizens. The upside to these pointless events, however, is that appeasing the liberal gun control agenda could perhaps make them happy enough with the perceived safety concern that they shut up about gun control for just a little while."
"Busted: Police Surgeon Charged As “Massive” Health Care Scam Uncovered, $146 MILLION",5 DEC 2017,2350,"DA-elect Eric Gonzalez briefed reporters on the arrests. 26 people have been indicted in a massive healthcare scheme. Four of the arrested were doctors and one of them was a New York Police Department surgeon. Dr. Robert Vaccarino, 61, has been charged with grand larceny and enterprise corruption for his role in the multi-million dollar scandal, with the total being $146 MILLION. These indictments come after a long-term investigation by the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office. The ringleader of the scheme is Kristina Mirbabayeva and officials claim she and the others defrauded health insurance companies, laundered money, and falsified business records over a three year period. Dr. Robert Vaccarino was arrested as part of the scheme. The plot allegedly involved sending people out onto the streets of Brooklyn, New York to recruit homeless and low-income patients. If the had Medicaid or Medicare for insurance, the recruits would be offered $40 or $40 in cash to go to a clinic and be examined. Once they arrived, the patients would be given multiple unnecessary tests such as ultrasounds and allergy tests. The insurers were billed for the expensive procedures. The money would then be laundered through a series of shell companies and bank accounts through countries such as China, Pakistan, and Turkey. Eventually, the money ended up back in the bank accounts of those involved. District Attorney-elect Eric Gonzalez stated; “These defendants allegedly exploited the poorest among us to divert millions of dollars from publicly-funded insurance programs these same vulnerable people rely on. Some of the defendants then used the stolen funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle consisting of multi-million dollars homes, expensive handbags, and luxury travel.”
 The other three New York City doctors involved were (left to right) Dr. Hamid Alam, Dr. Kevin Custis, and Dr. Jeffrey Chess. According to the website SeeThroughNY, Vaccarino made approximately $134,665 this year. He is affiliated with NYU Langone Health and Maimonides Medical Center. If he is convicted he could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison. DA Gonzalez stated;

Pennsylvania House Health Committee Passes SB 3 As “Innocent Children” Spared,5 DEC 2017,4989,"The Pennsylvania House Health Committee recently approved Senate Bill 3, which is a piece of pro-life legislation that prohibits doctors from performing dilation and evacuation (D&E) abortions, otherwise known as “dismemberment abortions” (pictured above). Earlier this week, the Pennsylvania House Health Committee approved Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which is a piece of pro-life legislation that prohibits doctors from performing dilation and evacuation (D&E) abortions. A D&E abortion, otherwise known as a “dismemberment abortion,” is a barbaric second-trimester abortion technique that essentially involves using medical forceps to rip fetuses, sometimes limb from limb, out of their mothers. In addition to banning dismemberment abortions, SB 3 would also ban abortions after twenty weeks. Unfortunately, while this vote is certainly a step in the right direction, there’s still a long way to go. This is because, even if it’s ultimately passed by the full House, where it’s headed next, there’s no guarantee that it’ll be signed into law due to the fact that Tom Wolf (D), the state’s Governor, has vowed to veto the legislation if it makes it to his desk. Tom Wolf (D), the Governor of Pennsylvania. “Put simply, women’s health care decisions should be left up to women and their doctors, not politicians in Harrisburg,” explained Wolf when asked about SB 3, noting, “[it] flies in the face of everything I stand for.” What’s worse, even if it does eventually get passed, the battle still wouldn’t be over as it’ll likely be overturned in court, which is what has recently happened to similar pieces of legislation. Earlier this month, for instance, Judge Lee Yeakel, a federal judge with the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, ruled that SB 8, which is a Texas law prohibiting doctors from performing dismemberment abortions, is unconstitutional. According to Judge Yeakel, such a cruel and unusual procedure must not be prohibited because it’s one of the easiest methods available. Judge Lee Yeakel, a federal judge with the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. “The State’s valid interest in promoting respect for the life of the unborn, although legitimate, is not sufficient to justify such a substantial obstacle to the constitutionally protected right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability,” reasoned Yeakel in his decision. “That a woman may make the decision to have an abortion before a fetus may survive outside her womb is solely and exclusively the woman’s decision. The power to make this decision is her right,” he explained, adding, “requiring a woman to undergo an unwanted, risky, invasive, and experimental procedure in exchange for exercising her right to choose an abortion, substantially burdens that right.” To clarify, he stated, “the evidence before the court is graphic and distasteful…[but it’s] germane only to the state’s interest in the dignity of fetal life and is weighed on the state’s side of the scale,” noting, “it does not remove weight from the woman’s side. And it does not add weight to tip the balance in the state’s favor.” In addition to SB 8, a similar law in Alabama was also recently struck down by a federal judge. Specifically, Myron Thompson, a senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, ruled several weeks ago that the state of Alabama cannot prohibit dismemberment abortions. In addition to banning dismemberment abortions, Thompson also overturned a state law banning abortion clinics from operating within 2,000 feet of elementary and middle schools. Myron Thompson, a senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. “The court finds the fetal-demise law effectively terminates the right to abortion for Alabama women at 15 weeks. Because it imposes an undue burden on the right of women in Alabama to obtain a pre-viability abortion, the court holds the fetal-demise law unconstitutional,” explained Thompson in his written decision before asserting that he doesn’t believe the government has a strong justification for the law, which he claimed places an “undue burden” on women. To clarify, he explained that “the fetal-demise law imposes a substantial burden in at least two interacting ways.” First, it “imposes significant health risks on most women who choose to have an abortion by requiring them to undergo a fetal-demise procedure that is unsafe or experimental.” And second, it “makes standard D&E–the only method of second-trimester abortion available in Alabama as a  practical matter–largely unavailable because no safe, non-experimental methods are feasible in the vast majority of cases.” Regardless of these rulings, conservatives must continue doing everything they can to put an end to dismember abortions. Doing so will help better protect the dignity of unborn children as well as uphold the Eighth Amendment."
"The Health Dangers Of Underground Trains: Subway Commuters Are Exposed To 10 Times More Cancerous Toxins Than Car Drivers, Study Warns",30 NOV 2017,3252,"Riders on some underground trains may be exposed to 10 times the level of carcinogens deemed safe Underground train riders are exposed to far more cancer-causing air pollution than is safe, recent research reveals. In Los Angeles, levels of toxins on one of the city’s most heavily-trafficked lines are 10 times greater than what is deemed acceptable by the US government and international health organizations, a University of Southern California study found. But even the busiest Los Angeles train lines see far fewer trains and commuters than other metropolitan areas like New York and London, where billions are in danger. The study’s findings suggest that subway systems – and particularly subway cars – need to be better ventilated to prevent the accumulation of dangerous toxins. Public transit is thought to reduce the green house gas emissions released into the environment by limiting the number of cars on the road. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that about 27 percent of total green house gas emissions come from the transportation industry and that the majority of that is created by cars and trucks on the road. In addition to the USC study, Canadian research published last month concluded ‘expanding the current configuration of public transit in North American cities is unlikely to yield improvements in local air quality.’ Meanwhile, evidence suggests that continued use of current underground systems without improvements poses a serious risk to public health. The grind of train cars against steel tracks creates a fine dust that is harmful to humans. The dust collects in underground tunnels and train cars, where there is insufficient ventilation to whisk it away. Los Angeles ridership has been on the decline, falling 20 percent in the last year, according to statistics from this past summer. But in cities like New York and London, underground trains are essential to the daily lives of millions of commuters, in addition to visitors. Each year, 1.65 billion people ride New York City trains. In London, about 2.18 billion people use trains annually. Steel train rails contains an element called chromium. When the metal is heated or subjected to friction – as it is as train cars run on the rails – a compound called hexavalent chromium is created.
Exposure to the compound is known to cause cancer. Extremely fine air pollutants – called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like hexavalent chromium – are particularly worrisome, as little can be done to protect us from coming into contact with them. They can infiltrate and become imbedded in the lungs and other internal organs, where they wreak havoc on our health. Hexavalent chromium is linked to nasal and sinus cancers, damage to the kidneys and liver, and irritation to the skin and eyes. The more train cars grind against the steel tracks, the more toxic dust is produced, and the greater the risk of health conditions becomes for commuters. In New York City, for example, there are more than 6,000 train cars in service. The Los Angeles subway system requires that train car windows be kept closed at all times, but the new University of Southern California research found that that measure did not keep commuters safe.

JUST IN: Dem Claims Health Issues As Supreme Court Dismisses “Frivolous” Confederate Flag Case,30 NOV 2017,4431,"The plight of this poor judge would end if the state would only cave to his demands. A Clarksdale city judge was on a crusade before the United States Supreme Court put an abrupt end to it. Judge Carlos Moore set his sights on the removal of the Mississippi flag after he declared it “An official endorsement of white supremacy.” The flag’s Confederate overtones were too much for Moore to bear. Moore should stay away from the governor’s mansion where the flag could cause his health to further deteriorate. Laughably the judge pins his health issues on the Mississippi flag. Moore’s expressed his pain, “I do believe once the flag is taken down from public property, I would immediately lose that stigmatic injury and that my blood pressure hopefully will go back to normal, will be controlled by medicine, my EKG will go back to normal and that I will have to take one less pill to sleep at night…I have too much pressure on me and the state is contributing to that pressure.” Moore claims the sight of the flag is threatening as he enters courtrooms in the great state of Mississippi. According to the judge, the flag in public areas means he is being treated like a second-class citizen, so the state must remove it. The judge sued the governor to force the state to change the Mississippi flag and he failed miserably. He then filed an appeal with the United States Supreme Court who rejected the ridiculous lawsuit. The courts just did not agree the innocuous flag was “an unconstitutional relic of slavery” as Moore’s suit alleged. The judge claims the flag is an “oppressive symbol” and that it is “racist.” Moore is also unsettled his daughter has to look at the flag in school. The judge even blames the flag for hurting Mississippi’s economy. Moore has removed the flag from his courtroom because he was so deeply troubled by it. The judge reported receiving death threats from citizens that were outraged he removed the flag from his courtroom after he was appointed. The deaths threats continued to roll in after he filed the failed lawsuit which would eventually be rejected by the United States Supreme Court. The citizens of Mississippi held a vote in 2001 regarding the state flag. The citizens who turned out voted to keep the flag as it was, soundly rejecting any move to change it. The state of Mississippi has been bullied by liberal social justice warriors and many of its institutions have caved to the pressure. Public Universities in the state have stopped flying the flag all together in an attempt to appease snowflakes who may have their feelings hurt at the mere sight of it. Other Confederate symbols across the state have been under attack by liberals feigning outrage. An anonymous coward made a threat online to destroy a 100-year-old monument in Corinth that honored a Confederate officer. William Rogers was killed in 1862 defending Corinth from Union soldiers, the statue was erected in his honor in 1912. Local police were dispatched to Alcorn County Courthouse so they could place barricades around the statue. An officer was also stationed there to guard the historic monument from criminal vandals. In August of this year, a group of liberal activists descended on a statue in Durham, North Carolina. The band of criminals tore down a statue of a Confederate soldier holding a gun. The mob was chanting “NO TRUMP, NO KKK, NO FASCIST U.S.A.”  The statue stood there since May of 1924 when it was dedicated to Confederate soldiers. The vandals were caught on camera and police would arrest the thugs in the days following the statues tragic demise. Takiya Fatima Thompson, Dante Emmanuel Strobino, Ngoc Loan Tran, and Peter Gull Gilbert were charged with two felonies, participating in a riot causing more than $1500 in property damage and inciting a riot. Moore is active on twitter and has used his account to spread anti-Trump stories published by left wing liberal media activist. He once retweeted a news rag reporting “Democrats think Trump is mentally ill and are contacting psychologist to help remove him from office.” The governor of Mississippi stands in opposition to Moore with the judge’s ridiculous claims and demands. Last year the Governor declared the month of April to be Confederate Heritage Month. The governor chose the month of April because it is the month the Confederacy began its struggle against the Union and four years later on the same month is when it ended.  "
"Trump Health Secretary Nominee, A Former Pharmaceutical Executive, Pledges To Take On High Drug Prices",29 NOV 2017,2759,"Alex Azar. Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive tapped by President Trump to be Health and Human Services secretary, told senators Wednesday that making prescription drugs more affordable would be one of his top priorities. “Drug prices are too high,” Azar told the Senate health committee, pledging to look at ways to increase competition and stop drugmakers from gaming the system. “I believe I can bring the skills and experiences to the table that can help us address these issues.” That appeared to satisfy most of the Senate health committee’s Republicans, who praised Azar’s experience at Indianapolis-based drug giant Eli Lilly. But Azar’s assurance drew skeptical questioning from many Democrats and from Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a conservative Republican who grilled Azar on his opposition to allowing Americans to import lower-priced drugs from Europe and elsewhere. “You’ve got some convincing to make me believe you are going to represent the American people,” Paul said. Azar, whom Trump nominated to replace Tom Price, would be the first Health secretary to come out of the pharmaceutical industry. Price stepped down in September amid criticism over his use of expensive chartered jets to travel. The White House has cited Azar’s industry background as an asset at a time when pressure is building on the federal government to rein in the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. But many consumer advocates are skeptical he will do anything that threatens drugmakers’ profits. “If Alex Azar’s nomination is confirmed, then Big Pharma’s coup d’état in the healthcare sphere will be virtually complete,” Public Citizen President Robert Weissman said Wednesday. While Azar was at Lilly, the company dramatically increased prices for its insulin product, prompting accusations of price gouging and investigations by officials in five states. Azar is widely viewed as more pragmatic and less ideological than Price, a staunch conservative who was an outspoken critic of the Affordable Care Act and many of its quality-improvement initiatives. Azar, by contrast, suggested one of his top priorities would be using the Medicare program’s leverage over doctors and hospitals to push for better outcomes for patients. But he also indicated he is interested in looking at ways to loosen health insurance rules implemented by the 2010 healthcare law, a key flashpoint in the ongoing partisan debate over the law, often called Obamacare. Prior to joining Lilly, Azar served in the Health and Human Services Department under former President George W. Bush, first as general counsel and then as deputy secretary. He will next appear before the Senate Finance Committee before his nomination is considered by the full Senate. H/T: Los Angeles Times"
Breakthrough For Growing Food On Mars After Scientists Prove Worms That Are Vital To Healthy Crops Can Reproduce In ‘Martian Soil’,28 NOV 2017,4268,"Dr Wieger Wamelink lead author of the study You may see them as irritating garden pests, but earthworms are actually vital for the survival of any ecosystem. Now, scientists have discovered that worms can reproduce in ‘Martian soil’ for the first time. The findings suggest that worms could reproduce on Mars, in what is a major step towards colonisation of the red planet. Researchers from Wageningen University in the Netherlands carried out an experiment that simulated life on Mars, and showed that two young earthworms were born in simulated Martian soil. The breakthrough follows a study by the same team last year in which various vegetables were harvested from the same soil. Dr Wieger Wamelink, lead author of the study, found the worms in a Mars soil simulant that he obtained from Nasa. The surface of Mars is covered by sand and dust – formed by the erosion of iron-rich igneous rocks similar to basalt. Known as ‘Regolith’ this material can be coarse, fine or powdery. Nasa’s soil simulant originates from a volcano on Hawaii and Dr Wamelink has been growing rocket in it to which worms have been added – along with pig slurry that mimics human waste. Dr Wamelink said: ‘The worms were from my own garden!’ But he was stunned when he discovered a couple of new arrivals – that he hadn’t completely expected. Dr Wamelink said: ‘Clearly the manure stimulated growth – especially in the Mars soil simulant – and we saw the worms were active. ‘However the best surprise came at the end of the experiment when we found two young worms in the Mars soil simulant.’ To feed future humans on Mars a sustainable agricultural ecosystem is a necessity, and worms will play a crucial role as they break down and recycle dead organic matter. Dr Wamelink said human excrement and urine will also have to be used to fertilise the soil, but pig slurry is being used for ‘practical and safety reasons.’ The Mars soil even outperformed silver sand – a fine white sand used by gardeners on Earth. Dr Wamelink said: ‘The positive effect of adding manure was not unexpected but we were surprised it makes Mars soil simulant outperform Earth silver sand.’ His team added organic matter from earlier experiments to both sands and the manure to a sample of the pots. Then – after germination of the rocket – they put in the worms. Dr Wamelink said: ‘We therefore ended up with pots with all possible combinations with the exception of organic matter which was added to all of the pots.’ Dr Wamelink’s experiments are crucial in determining if people can keep themselves alive on the red planet by growing their own crops. Worms are needed for healthy soil not only on Earth but also in future indoor gardens on Mars or the moon. They thrive on dead organic matter such as old plant remains which they eat, chew and mix with soil before they excrete it. This still contains organic matter that is broken down further by bacteria – releasing nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium for use by the plants. By digging burrows the worms also aerate and improve the structure of the soil – making watering the plants more effective. The latter proved to be very important in earlier experiments where water would not easily penetrate the soil. Dr Wamelink said: ‘Worms will solve this problem.’ To feed the future humans living on Mars or the moon the project Food for Mars and Moon aims to set up a sustainable agricultural system. It’s based on the presence of soils and water – in the form of ice – on both Mars and the moon. Dr Wamelink said: ‘For the Earth-based research we are using soil simulants delivered by Nasa. ‘The simulants originate from a volcano in Hawaii for Mars and a desert in Arizona for the moon.’ He said: ‘The experiments started in 2013. Nowadays we are able to grow over a dozen crops – the only species that has resisted our efforts so far is spinach. ‘However crops such as green beans, peas, radish, tomato, potato, rocket, carrot and garden cress all seem possible. ‘The crops were analysed for heavy metals and also alkaloids to check their safety for human consumption. ‘After passing these tests we organised a dinner based on the harvested crops for the people that supported our research via the crowdfunding campaign.’ H/T: Daily Mail"
Congress Scrambles: Health Impact Reveals 6 Million Americans Exposed To Cancer Chemical,22 NOV 2017,5018,"Fluoride has been banned in Europe and Japan for the health risks it poses. Flint, Michigan is notorious for having their unpotable drinking water.  1 in 54 Americans are being poisoned by the water that they drink.  The level of fluoride content in the water has reached dangerous heights. The chemicals that have come under the greatest scrutiny and have been most studied are now being linked to a list of health problems.  High cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer are only a few of the conditions that are appearing now. The fluoride used to sterilize drinking water is the same chemical that can be found in furniture and carpet as well as cosmetics, food packaging and firefighting foam.  All the chemicals that come out of manufactured facilities or are created as a byproduct in factories find their way into the environmentn and eventually our bodies. Director of the Center for Disease Control’s National Center for Environmental Health, Patrick Breysse, has labeled the pandemic, “one of the most seminal public health challenges for the next decades.”  Some scientists have gone so far as to suggest our government is carrying out an unintended experiment on the people of the united states (Dr. Strangelove?). The Eurofins Eaton Analytical laboratories had done some initial studies for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Some estimates show that the contaminated drinking water may be impacting up to a quarter of the nation’s water systems.  With 28% of the nation’s water showing signs of toxicity, 6 million Americans are in danger. Spatial analysis of 2013–2015 national drinking water PFAS concentrations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3) program. Eaton said he believes part of the issue began in 2013. The EPA at the time was primarily worried about PFOS contamination above 200 ppt, and PFOA above 400 ppt, as those were temporary health advisory levels at the time. But in 2016, the EPA created a new, much lower advisory level: 70 ppt combined.  This dropped the permitted amount safely allowed by an eighth.  First, the 70 ppt safety level is precariously close to the 60 ppt detection level the EPA used for its study. Second, there were four other perfluorinated compounds considered in the EPA program, and each was analyzed separately. Detection of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in U.S. drinking water are compounded by industrial sites, military fire training areas, and wastewater treatment plants.  Thirty-nine leading scientists and physicians signed a letter, which was sent to legislators on key committees in the House and Senate. The letter was also sent to legislators of impacted regions to draw attention to the pollution of drinking water with these chemicals.  The Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration also received this letter, because firefighting foams used at military bases and airports are responsible for a major share of the contamination. The response to immediate threats such as in Flint, Michigan, has been lackluster to say the least.  The government seems unable to produce an adequate reaction to the widespread issues of plaguing the nation. A small step that has been taken by Congress was to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  This bill passed both the House and Senate last week allocating $7 million to begin a 5-year long health study of communities afflicted by the firefighting chemicals.  The legislation would also establish the first-ever nationwide study on the human health effects of exposure to highly fluorinated chemicals from drinking water. Fluoride levels in bottled waters Another provision in the bill apportions $72 million to be added to the Air Force and Navy’s budget to be used for environmental restoration and cleaning impacted areas. The NDAA also takes additional steps to prevent future contamination.  Certain chemical and aviation fires must be put out using the fluorinated foams as per Department of Defense rule referred to as the Milspec.  Thanks to the NDAA the Department of Defense is now required to submit reports and develop new materials and methods to fight fires. These foams are required to be phased out and replaced within 6 months.  Unfortunately, the newer variety of foams currently in use are also highly fluorinated.  New foams must be developed to replace the materials the military will be switching to because the ecological and health impact is no different. Oil drilling platforms and airports across the world are capable of using fluorine-free foams.  As soon as the Department of Defense can change their Mil-spec rule, domestic airports can make the switch. The EPA will consider occurrence data along with health effects information to determine whether or not to initiate the process to develop stronger regulations; a decision is expected in 2021. Water treatment facilities add chemicals like chlorine, sodium, and flouride to the drinking water."
Mom Filed Mental Health Warrant Against Son Day Before She Was Killed,21 NOV 2017,1936,"Constable Alan Rosen released the new details to reporters. Cindy Therwhanger was a therapist and a counselor who helped people cope with trauma and family violence. For six years she worked at Shield-Bearer Counseling Center. “A very generous person,” said Executive Director Roy Wooten. “(With) a generous heart.” The loss is difficult, especially given the circumstances. Investigators said Saturday that Therwanger was stabbed to death. Her 30-year-old son, Tyler, was arrested at the scene. His clothes were bloody. “We are, all of us, in grief,” said Wooten. “Shocked, and in deep sadness.” She was a mother to three and a grandmother to two. She also worked at Northwest Ministries, which said they grieve her loss and offer sympathy to the family — a family that told ABC13 they are struggling. Eyewitness News has learned on Friday, the day before the 55-year-old was killed in her northwest Harris County home, she filed for a mental health warrant against her son. “If they state the sufficient facts that this person may be suffering from a mental illness and because of the mental illness they pose a threat, either to themselves or to others, then the judge will sign the warrant,” explained Harris County Probate Court 3 Judge Rory Olsen. Precinct 1 Constable Alan Rosen said that after a judge signed it, within four hours, his deputies went looking for Tyler Therwhanger. “We made a few attempts to get this young man and bring him into the hospital for an evaluation by a medical doctor,” said Rosen. They could not find him. When they checked back the next morning, it was too late. A woman who spent her adult life helping those coping with violence was a victim. “She was really gifted and wise in her work with seeing pain in people’s lives and bringing them some comfort and healing there,” said Wooten. Tyler Therwhanger is in the Harris County Jail’s medical unit on a capital murder charge. H/T: ABC 13 Houston"
Judge Blasts CA Health Giant Over “Specific And Unusual Destruction” Of Evidence,20 NOV 2017,6495,"San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow says Sutter Health, the Northern California health care giant is guilty of evidence destruction. When corporations start acting in favor of their own interests by cutting corners or breaking the law, it can get ugly real fast. Take Sutter Health, for instance. The Northern California-based company is a giant in the California healthcare industry. But when employers and labor unions sought evidence in a lawsuit that accuses the healthcare network of abusing its market power and charging inflated prices, Sutter destroyed 192 boxes of evidence, according to a state judge. “Sutter destroyed documents knowing that the evidence was relevant to antitrust issues. … There is no good explanation for the specific and unusual destruction here,” San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow said in a ruling this week. He also cited an internal email by a Sutter employee which said she was “running and hiding” after ordering the records destroyed in 2015. The most generous interpretation to Sutter, he wrote in his ruling, is it was “grossly reckless.” Sutter Health is a giant in the California healthcare industry Sutter’s network includes doctors, 24 hospitals, and other healthcare services in more than 100 Northern California cities and towns. Sutter Health-affiliated hospitals provide cardiac care, women’s and children’s services, cancer care, orthopedics and advanced patient safety technology. The company generates nearly $12 billion in annual revenue. Sutter Health sanctioned the destruction of nearly 200 boxes of evidence for its own trial. It said the destruction of the evidence was “a regrettable mistake.” One reason this case is important is that it exemplifies the bigger concerns healthcare policymakers, academics, and think tanks had about ObamaCare. They predicted President Obama’s health care reform law would consolidate the market by halting the construction of physician-owned hospitals and driving private practitioners into healthcare networks. Employers and policymakers are watching the case closely because of the financial implications of industry consolidation. Large health systems with deep pockets are gaining market share due to their ability to raise prices by acquiring more hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, and physician offices. Smaller systems are being winnowed out through attrition. Richard Grossman, the lead plaintiffs’ lawyer representing more than 1,500 employer-funded health plans, told Kaiser Health News it’s stunning what Sutter did to cover up incriminating documents in this case. In 2015 Melissa Brendt, the chief contracting officer in Sutter’s managed-care department, and Daniela Almeida, an assistant general counsel, authorized Brendt’s executive assistant to destroy 10 years’ worth of managed-care documents going back to 1995. These documents had originally been designated to be destroyed in 2035 — 20 years later. In her deposition, Sina Santagata, Brendt’s executive assistant, testified she wasn’t aware of any other time in her 17 years at Sutter when the managed-care department destroyed records held in storage. One email by Santagata was considered “particularly noteworthy,” said the judge. After sending the order to destroy the records Santagata emailed Brendt on July 30, 2015. She wrote: “I’ve pushed the button … if someone is in need of a box between 3/15/95 & 11/23/05 … I’m running and hiding. … ‘Fingers crossed’ that I haven’t authorized something the FTC will hunt me down for.” The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is an independent agency of the United States government. It was established to promote consumer protection and to eliminate and prevent anti-competitive business practices, such as coercive monopoly. In healthcare, it enforces antitrust laws to prevent hospitals, drug makers, and other industry players from engaging in anti-competitive behavior which could harm consumers. Santagata testified she was being “sarcastic.” Sutter told the judge the FTC reference was just a “joke.” But Judge Karnow saw no humor in it, writing: “There are infinite topics for jokes, and the choice of this one is strong evidence” in the plaintiffs’ favor.” The judge ordered Sutter to examine email backup tapes from 2002 through 2005 to search for documents on some of the same topics as the destroyed records. Karnow also wrote he will consider a plaintiffs’ motion for issuing jury instructions which are adverse to Sutter in light of the document destruction. A trial is scheduled for June 2019. Karnow wrote: “The record shows that Sutter’s conduct was more than just an inadvertent error.” The is not the first time Sutter Health has been in trouble. James Brosnahan, an attorney with Morrison & Foerster, speaks at a news conference in 2010 concerning legal action against Sutter Health Corp. regarding a missing $120 million. Brosnahan stands with Marin General Hospital Board members, physicians and nurses, elected officials from Marin County and representatives of community groups throughout Marin. Grossman, the plaintiffs’ counsel, told Kaiser Health News much of the evidence is irreplaceable, and until we address the anti-competitive behavior of entities like Sutter, we will not solve the problem of high costs in health care. The plaintiffs seek to recover hundreds of millions of dollars from Sutter. They claim the company illegally inflated prices. For instance, the lawsuit alleges an overnight hospital stay at Sutter hospitals in San Francisco or Sacramento cost at least 38 percent more than a comparable stay in the more competitive Los Angeles market. Hospital prices at Sutter and Dignity Health, the two biggest hospital chains in California, were 25 percent higher than at other hospitals around the state, according to a study published last year. Researchers at the University of Southern California concluded Sutter and other giant health systems use their market power to drive up prices — making the average patient admission at both chains nearly $4,000 more expensive. Kathy Hempstead, a health care researcher at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told Kaiser Health News that Sutter is a pretty extreme case of market power, but health care consolidation has become a really important issue across the country. “It’s been on the back burner somewhat because of the debate over the Affordable Care Act, but there is bipartisan interest in tackling this,” she told Kaiser Health News."
"Army Lifts Ban, People With Certain Health Issues Allowed To Join As Resolution Passes",13 NOV 2017,4918,"The Army’s Lifted Ban Could Spell Trouble! The US Army will now allow waivers for those wishing to enlist for a wider variety of mental issues. The new change to waiver policy will allow those with history of self-mutilation, bipolar disorder, depression, and those with a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse to join. The US Army has long had fairly strict standards for those wishing to enlist. These standards became all the more strict after the military began to draw down troop strength during the Obama presidency, as soldiers were shed to reduce payroll costs to the Army and other US Military branches. Waivers have long been available for various infractions considered “minor,” in order for the military to attract and accept talented individuals with skills that the Army was seeking. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were fought in earnest during the Bush presidency, and as the need to recruit a larger number of soldiers grew, waivers became commonplace for a wide variety of otherwise disqualifying factors. Recruits from 2006, taking the oath of enlistment. Mental health waivers for certain mental health problems were disallowed in 2009 due to the rise of suicide rates among troops. However, according to Lieutenant Colonel Randy Taylor, the increased availability of medical data concerning new enlistees has made such a waiver useful again. Now that they can more accurately get a feel for the medical history of a recruit. Colonel Elspeth Richie, an Army psychiatrist and expert on waivers for military service, disagrees, however. According to Colonel Richie, people with an issue of mental health problems are more prone to having those issues resurface during service, when they could be a disruption to the unit the soldier is serving with. US Army recruits during Infantry One-Stop Unit Training (OSUT) Those suffering from bipolar disorder often are able to maintain a stable mindset with the help of medication. However, many authoritative psychological and psychiatric texts, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-V), published by the American Psychiatric Association, state that behavior such as self-mutilation can be the sign of a larger underlying mental health issue. There have been issues with waivers in the past, which are sometimes used to allow soldiers with otherwise poor qualifications to enlist in the Army. In 2006 a group of soldiers, including one with a waiver for minor criminal activity and poor educational background, raped an Iraqi girl and killed her family. Groups have found that an increase in moral waivers has implications concerning the killing of noncombatants during combat. Army recruits at Basic Combat Training firing M16’s The waiver system is not a simple one, and the onus is on the applicant to show that they are deserving of the waiver. The waiver system is meant to allow individuals who may have had issues earlier in life enlist. These applicants are meant to be those with other merit, such as high Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), or specialized skills that are in demand. However, the military is undergoing a recruitment drive, aiming to recruit 80,000 new soldiers by September 2018. In the last fiscal year, they managed to recruit 69,000 new soldiers, which was done via a variety of incentives. Us Army recruits practice proper hand grenade-throwing posture In hopes of meeting the new demands for troop strength, recruiters and the Army have upped the incentive for enlistment.  For example, they are now offering up to a $40,000 enlistment bonus, depending upon qualifications and the Military Occupational Specialty that a recruit chooses. In fiscal year 2014, the Army spent $8.2 million on enlistment bonuses.  In fiscal year 2016, that number had jumped to $284 million, and in 2017 it has grown further to $424 million in enlistment bonuses being paid out. However, as the demand for more soldiers continues to grow, so too does the number of soldiers getting waivers or coming from less desirable classifications of potential recruit. Category IV recruits, those who score below what is generally acceptable on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, made up 0.6% of recruits in 2016. In 2017, 1.9% of recruits were in Category IV. Category IV recruits, who score between 30 and 10 on the ASVAB, are considered to be barely trainable for even the most basic of Army tasks. The Army is, by law, barred from accepting more than 4 percent of its recruits in any given year from Category IV. In 2018, this could mean as many as 3,200 enlisted troops from the lowest acceptable level of volunteer. Waivers are meant to allow the military to accept recruits with skills who have minor disqualifying factors in their history.  Whether the loosening of standards concerning mental health issues will be a positive or negative for the military remains to be seen."
"United Cancels Flights, “Health Emergency” Puts Popular Destination Off-Limits",13 NOV 2017,4677,"It is too dangerous to travel to the city with air like this. As thick smog crept over India’s capital this past week and smudged landmarks from view, Nikunj Pandey could feel his eyes and throat burning. Pandey stopped doing his regular workouts and said he felt tightness in his lungs. He started wearing a triple layer of pollution masks over his mouth. And he became angry that he couldn’t safely breathe the air. “This is a basic right,” he said. “A basic right of humanity.” Pandey is among many people in New Delhi who have become more aware of the toxic air in recent years and are increasingly frustrated at the lack of meaningful action by authorities. This past week the air was the worst it’s been all year in the capital, with microscopic particles that can affect breathing and health spiking to 75 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization. Experts have compared breathing the air to smoking a couple of packs of cigarettes a day. The Lancet medical journal recently estimated that some 2.5 million Indians die each year from pollution. United Airlines suspended its flights between New Delhi and Newark, New Jersey, for Saturday and Sunday because of the heavy air pollution in the Indian capital, said Sonia, an airline official who uses one name. Pandey said the millions of rural folk who have moved to the city understand the problem better than they once did, and are trying everything from tying scarves over their faces to eating “jaggery,” a sugar cane product that some people believe offers a range of health benefits. Masks once considered an affectation of hypochondriac tourists are these days routinely worn by government workers and regular people on the street. Volunteers handed out thousands of green surgical masks this week to make a point about the pollution, but such masks likely have a limited impact on keeping out the tiny particles from people’s lungs. “This is truly a health emergency,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of research and advocacy at New Delhi’s Centre for Science and Environment. She said doctors in recent days have been dealing with a 20 percent spike in emergency hospital admissions from people suffering heart and lung problems. And that’s in a city, she said, where one in every three children already has compromised lungs. Seema Upadhyaya, who heads a primary school, said she has never before witnessed so many children suffering from respiratory illnesses as she has this year. That has prompted changes to the curriculum. “It’s impacting everybody,” she said. Authorities have been taking extraordinary measures to try to mitigate the immediate crisis. They have temporarily closed schools and stopped most trucks from entering the city. The government put off a decision for rationing car usage starting Monday as pollution levels started coming down in the city, said Kailash Gahlot, New Delhi’s transport minister. But everyone agrees such measures don’t address the root causes, which remain hard to solve. Roychowdhury said the city’s pollution has been trapped this week by a lack of wind at ground level, colliding winds in the upper atmosphere, and cooling temperatures. Air quality typically gets worse at this time of year as nearby farmers burn fields and people build street fires to keep warm. The conditions this week prompted the capital’s top elected official, Arvind Kejriwal, to describe his city as a “gas chamber.” While crop burning has been banned in and around the capital, officials say it’s hard to punish impoverished farmers for continuing traditional methods that have been handed down through the generations. Pandey said it’s part of a broader problem in India. “Your water is not healthy, your food is not healthy, your vegetables are polluted, they are poisoned,” he said. “I mean, everything is polluted right now.” Roychowdhury said she is encouraged there is rising awareness of the air quality problem, both among residents and the medical community. But she says authorities need to do more. She said officials have been asking people this week to use more public transport, but at the same time the city doesn’t have enough buses and hasn’t bought any new ones in recent years. “What we are saying, and the Supreme Court has already asked for it, is that there should be a comprehensive plan for all sources of pollution,” she said. Meanwhile, people like Pandey say they are going to have to suffer through because New Delhi is where they need to be based for work opportunities and their families. “We are India, right?” he said. “We just try to survive in whatever condition we are in. That is how it is.” H/T: ABC 7 Chicago"
"143 Dead In 3 Months, Plague Threatens Mainland As Health Officials Name 10th Nation",11 NOV 2017,2189,"Health officials are struggling to keep up with the outbreak. Less than three months ago, news began coming from Africa that a plague was sweeping through Madagascar. The cause of the outbreak had a gruesome source, an ancient local tradition of dancing with dead bodies. Health officials have now confirmed that the plague has killed at least 143 people since August. Now Malawi, another nation in Africa has become the 10th to be warned that the disease is on its way. The plague is threatening the mainland. The outbreak coincides with a yearly ritual which seems quite strange to us in America. Families exhume the bodies of their dead relatives, wrap them in sheets, and dance in the streets with them. Many of these dead passed away from the plague. Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff states; “If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for [the ritual], the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body.” Unfortunately, locals believe the plague is a government conspiracy. They have no intention of foregoing the sacred ritual. More than 2,000 people have been infected in Madagascar so far and at least 143 are dead. Health officials believe they are ready for an outbreak in Malawi, a nation that has not seen the disease since 2002. Dr. Dan Namarika, principal secretary in the ministry of health stated; “We have infection prevention materials ready and groups and teams ready to be activated if there is a trigger.” Additional information about the plague. South Africa, Mauritius, Seychelles, Tanzania, La Réunion, Mozambique, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Comoros have been put on alert as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) has pledged about $5 million to fight the disease. They predict that it could take six months to stem the outbreak, however. This strain of the plague can be cured with antibiotics. In the span of one week, the number of cases has risen 8%. The biggest fear right now is the disease spreading to mainland Africa. Jimmy Whitworth, professor and health expert, describes this outbreak as the “worst in 50 years or more.” Source: Daily Mail"
Nebraska Center Of Controversy As Health Officials REFUSE To Answer Questions,9 NOV 2017,5160,"Officials in Nebraska are under the gun as their refusal to provide key information to citizens could endanger thousands of lives. Intrigue and mystery are surrounding the death of a patient in Nebraska as the authorities responsible for detailing the death are suddenly silent. The patient’s identity has not been revealed as their cases was of great public interest because they had contracted Tuberculosis. Although the patient was diagnosed and later transferred, the patient still died, which makes people wonder how someone in this country and in this day and age could contract such a rare and practically erased disease. The real reason that people are worried about the lack of information is because the patient was diagnosed and died only a few short days after the diagnosis. Essentially, that means they had likely been walking around or engaging with others with active Tuberculosis for a long time.. Concerned citizens have been met with silence and dead ends as they try to piece together information that could explain the death of this patient. Were they an American citizen who had been traveling to countries with active TB or was it an unvetted refugee whose illness has been hidden long enough to spread within a community? Neither of these cases are particularly true or not but the fact that an identity has not even been released is enough to cause concern. The number do not lie and it shows that nearly 50% of those with TB are refugees in the United States. As harsh as it sounds, it comes with them and the United States cannot risk accepting extremely ill immigrants, especially with a disease as easily spread as TB. Authorities are complicit with statistic cover ups all the time as those within police forces and other institutions are silenced about the crimes committed by illegal aliens and refuges. Apparently it is not good press to expose the fact that the people the liberals are demanding be let in are actually uncivilized criminals bent on doing as they please. Many of the stories do not make the headlines because the main stream media is insistent killing stories that go against their narrative. It is entirely possible that a refugee entered into Nebraska with the deadly disease as a part of a lottery or another refugee program but they could not have been documented or examined properly. It seems like a no brainer to at least make sure someone is not carrying a deadly virus or disease, as the United States used to do with all of their immigrants on Ellis Island. Now it is apparently racist to make sure people do not bring dangerous illnesses with them. In fact, any form of questioning is probably some form of white supremacy according to leftists, as their arguments have been reduced to mere demagogic language used to inspire fear and hate. The living conditions for refugees across the globe is abysmal and a breeding ground for disease and illness. A problem like TB could spread through a community extremely rapidly. It just does not make any sense as to why the Nebraska authorities are withholding the information surrounding the patient.  Their jobs involve keeping the public safe and informed about the growing dangers present and yet by limiting the information available, they are censoring important information. If it was just an American who got it when they were overseas then that is one thing, but if it was a refugee or illegal alien the American people have a right to know. This is a disease that ravaged the United States throughout its history but for the first time, this nation managed to severely reduce the number of cases until it was practically eliminated. This is a disease that used to cripple and rip families apart and yet in the modern age we have had the luxury of forgetting about this terrible and horrendous disease. However, it does not seem that way for much longer. If the evidence stated above is confirmed to be true and the patient was engaging with their community for months prior to being diagnosed then the chances are high that the disease is spreading. TB is spread extremely easily as coughing or any kinds of saliva exchange, laughing or singing, can transmit the disease. If the patient was walking around for weeks or months prior to being diagnosed, then who knows exactly who or how many have been infected? This situation would not bode well if it turns out that the patient was a refugee because those communities are tight and often involved tight living quarters which can cause the disease to spread even more. This is not cause to panic as enough is simply not yet known, but the fact that there is an attempt to sweep this under the rug and keep the identity anonymous does not bode well. Those complicit with withholding crucial information that could prevent deaths or the spread of this disease need to speak up or be held accountable if the unthinkable happens and this outbreak spreads. Those trying to protect a narrative that suggests that refugees and illegal aliens pose no threat to American lives need to reconsider their position and realize what is at stake if they continue to conform to failed progressive talking points."
"Florida Health Officials Claim First Case As Virus Transmitted, Stressing Non-Issue",7 NOV 2017,2578,"Florida health officials are taking the battle to the mosquitoes which are likely to spread Zika. Zika is a virus that, while often doing very little to adults, can cause deformities and other cognitive problems in babies as they are being carried to term by their mothers. This is a disease which terrifies mothers and keeps the father to be awake at night, full of dread. Sadly, CBS Miami has confirmed that “Florida health officials are reporting the first sexually transmitted case of Zika in Miami-Dade County.” The infected person is said to have not traveled, however, the father had recently been to Cuba and other areas where the fearsome virus is known to thrive. Both the mother and the father have tested positive for Zika, and still, health officials are saying that “there is no evidence of ongoing, active transmission of Zika anywhere in Florida.” That is a non-issue is this disease spreads like it is capable of doing, for while that may be true at this time, it does not take a genius to deduce that the infection could spread just from these two. For that matter,  it may have spread already and it may simply have not been discovered yet. In 2017, a total of 205 people have been shown to have acquired the virus and there is no shortage of people warning that this is a disease that is just waiting to become a massive problem for cultures the world over. There is a lot of reason for this concern, too. Everyday Health reports that mosquito bites and sexual contact spread the disease and that it hides from detection because it’s symptom are seemingly harmless. However, unborn babies are the target of concern for Zika and horrifying cases of mental retardation can be its payload. A vaccine is in the works, but considering the risks that are already known from vaccines, this too is cause for worry. Considering the way that Zika blazed through Africa, however, the risks may be worth it for those traveling to known hotspots. Chemical sprays are used to combat Zika carrying mosquitoes. Those in Florida who have a high immune system defense (which some define at no less than 3000 mg of vitamin C in liquid form per day) are thought by some to be the best prepared to ward off the illness. Still, nothing is guaranteed for anyone. That is why this medical case will be watched very closely as it develops. While many are blind to this virus, the damage that it can bring is limitless. It needs to be taken that seriously. Each case needs to be logged, recorded, and properly monitored. Unborn lives depend on it. Sources: CBS Miami – Everyday Health"
"Florida Health Officials Reveal The Worst As Woman Avoids Treatment, Issues Plea",1 NOV 2017,4361,"Florida Health officials are warning residents about contact with wild animals after an identified individual was bitten by a bat, but did not seek treatment. The person’s painful death was caused by rabies. Health officials in Florida recently announced that a victim died after being bitten by a bat. The resident apparently contracted rabies, but did not seek treatment for the deadly disease. Florida Department of Health spokeswoman Mara Gambineri told told local reporters in Orlando that the victim lived in Highlands County in southwest Florida. The name of the person was not released, nor did Gambineri say exactly when the bite occurred or when the victim died. However, she did caution all viewers to avoid direct contact with local wildlife and urged people to seek treatment for any animal bite, whether the animal was rabid or not. According to the World Health Organization, 30 percent of rabies cases that end in fatalities are contracted through bat bites. Rabies is a life threatening condition that is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths around the globe each year. Dogs are the most common source of the disease, but people have been exposed to rabies from other animals too. Recently, a group of Muslim migrants in Europe were infected after using a donkey for sexual relations. Apparently, that sort of conduct is a common “tradition” among some followers of Islam. The infection attacks the central nervous system and can be transmitted from human to human if bodily fluids like saliva is exposed to broken skin, but it is rare. Most cases are contracted from an infected animal. Rabies can be treated, but the cure is painful. As soon as saliva from an infected animal (or another bodily fluid) comes into contact with broken skin or a mucus membrane, the deadly disease is transmitted. The illness attacks the central nervous system, causing the brain to swell. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 59,000 people die of rabies each year. About 99 percent have been bitten by a dog. As it attacks the nervous system, it causes inflammation of the brain, and the key to survival depends on fast treatment. Most people have an image of a dog foaming at the mouth if it is rabid. However, the initial symptoms include muscle weakness and fever. Two different types of the disease produce different symptoms. People who contract Furious Rabies can display erratic behavior and become extremely excitable. They might also develop insomnia, anxiety, confusion, and hallucinations. And, it does actually produce excessive saliva. Paralytic Rabies is slower to develop, but just as deadly. The victim eventually becomes paralyzed and will slip into a coma before death. About 30 percent of the reported cases each year are this form of the disease. Nearly 60,000 people are infected with rabies and die each year from the disease, according to the World Health Organization. Fatalities in third-world countries are naturally higher than in nations that offer vaccinations and treatment. The people most at risk are those who live near large bat populations, those in developing countries, and rural areas where there is an increased animal population. Although dogs are responsible for the most cases of rabies, bat bites are the leading cause of rabies deaths in America. Treatment includes getting a series of five shots to prevent infection. It’s crucial for people to seek treatment immediately after being bitten for the best chance of survival. Once the infection is full blown, it cannot be treated. However, rabies can be prevented with a vaccination. People who come into contact with wild animals are recommended to get it, or anyone who plans to travel to a third world country. Keeping pets vaccinated and preventing them from roaming outside can also reduce the odds of exposure. Bats, most certainly, should be kept away from homes and other structures where people go. Because they are the leading cause of death from the disease, it’s best to avoid them altogether. Health officials in Florida say that the main cause of infection in that state is from raccoon and bat bites. Taking precautions during camping excursions is recommended. No other information was released about the victim or how that person was bitten. Health officials used the incident to warn communities about the deadly disease."
"Health Officials Issue Plea To Families As Plague Spreading, Deadlier Strain Revealed",1 NOV 2017,3053,"Health officials are warning that this practice of dancing with the dead must end at once. Some people have frighteningly strange and often dangerous religious beliefs. For instance, most readers will remember the man who the Conservative Daily Post reported about on October 24th who boiled himself alive on accident as he tried to cleanse himself in a human wok. Now that Halloween has come and gone, the next few days should see quite a few disturbing examples of some of these similar practices. One such story comes from the Sun who’ve found that relatives are “dancing with the corpses of their loved ones who have died from the Black Death” and are spreading it around like fall leaves. The plague is actually making a comeback in Madagascar because people are dancing with dead victims. The deadliest strain of this dreadful disease can be transmitted just by breathing in the same air as an infected person. The practice is called Famadihana and Madagascans are being asked to halt the practice which entails digging up deceased ancestors and dancing with them before their rotting corpses are put back into the Earth. The island has seen over 120 people die after engaging in the ghoulish ritual and the nation’s health chief, Willy Randriamarotia, said, “If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for a Famadihana, the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body.” Even in such a far removed place in the world, the basics of modern medicine are common and this is done as if it were not. Those engaged in the religion will likely continue the practice even as the new victims become tomorrows dance partners. Though the disgusting dance has been banned, one practitioner said, “I have participated in at least 15 Famadihana ceremonies and I’ve never caught the plague.” Rather than be thankful for his luck, he views it as some kind of boasting opportunity. They show no fear as they handle the death shrouds and burial clothes of those who perished from the Black Death. Out of the  1,200 people who have acquired the Black Death, an illness that killed one-third of Europe in past times and during the Dark Ages, 50 were confirmed as aid workers. Olivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger has warned, “The epidemic is ahead of us, we have not yet reached the peak.” Dr. Ashok Chopra, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas agreed and said also, “If they are traveling shorter distances and they’re still in the incubation period, and they have the pneumonic (form) then they could spread it to other places.” The line of people engaged in Famadihana seems limitless. He added, “We don’t want to have a situation where the disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control.” Since between 30 to 60% of those who get the plague die from it, this is a stark warning in the strongest terms. Will it be heeded? That we won’t know until the body count has reached its climax. Sources: The Conservative Daily Post – The Sun"
Liberals Attack “Grossly Unhealthy” Activity As Progressive Officials Ban Popular Holiday Sight,31 OCT 2017,1103,"Liberal Democrat councilor Richard Kemp argued that the product promotes obesity in children. The famous red Coca-Cola truck should be banned from visiting the city of Liverpool this Christmas, according to members of a U.K. political party The English city’s Liberal Democrat party has written a letter to mall owners who host the truck, asking that the tradition should not take place because Liverpool “is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.” Originally reported in the Liverpool Echo, Liberal Democrat councilor Richard Kemp said almost one in three 11-year olds in the city were currently obese and the visit of Coca-Cola was a cynical event. Kemp claimed that 10 percent of all hospital beds In Liverpool are currently occupied by people with type II diabetes. Responding to the criticism, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola Great Britain said in a statement that the Liverpool truck visit, now in its seventh year, always elicited a “positive response.” Coca-Cola Great Britain also said that anyone visiting the holiday truck could enjoy sugar-free and diet versions of the carbonated drink.

Researchers Announce Shocking New Breakthrough As Mental Health Study Reveals All,31 OCT 2017,2455,"Marcel Just (pictured) is excited about what this new tool could offer those trying to save lives. We live in a very suicidal time. Some profess that it is because God is missing from his rightful place in our schools, other suggest that the culture that the MSM pushes makes us all sociopaths to some degree, and some have no idea why it is. Still, we all know that it is true and now the Verge is telling us that something rather scary may be done to try and curb it. According to their report, scientists “have trained a computer program to identify people with suicidal thoughts based on their brain scans.” It is said that this “study is small” but that it opens the door to being able to find mental illness on a physical level. This new way of looking for mental illness may reveal it all! Over one million people choose to take their own lives every year when the pain of existing becomes too much for them. Since many people do not wish to address such concerns while in the midst of sorrow, in a study “published today in the journal  Nature Communications, researchers observed” and monitored the brain activity in two different people. The secrets of the brain are being unlocked. One of the test subjects was suicidal while the other one was not. They were told to think of the words “evil” or “praise” and the data was fed into the algorithm created by the researchers. Those with thoughts of killing themselves were predicted with a 91% accuracy, the study concluded. In the past, the rate has been as high as 94%! Sadly, brain scans are too expensive for this to employed very often, though study author Marcel Just, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University said, “it’d be nice to have this additional method.” There is the chance that such predictions could set a person off who was not going to end it all or who was wavering, however, and this concern was not addressed in depth. Since the testing is not perfect, it is unlikely at this time that we shall see very much of this new technology in practice. Over one million people commit suicide every year. This does open the door for predictive medicine which could work in tandem with predictive law enforcement someday. Needless to say, this is a slippery slope that none of us wish to tread upon and it could be only right around the corner. New “breakthroughs” are often used to bait a doltish public into dreadful ideas. Hopefully, this won’t be one of them. Source: The Verge"
Texas Health Department Makes Shocking Find As Liberal Clinics REEK Of Violations,27 OCT 2017,4456,"Abby Jonson (pictured) was appalled by what she found at WWH clinics. There are those opposed to abortions and those who are pro-choice. Likewise, there are those who are accepting of certain kinds of abortions which take place prior to the third trimester while there are some that are against even “the morning after” pill. There won’t be any way to sway very many people on either side at this point, but we all agree that any place conducting such procedures should at least have to meet health standards. Well, they don’t. The Daily Caller writes that a “string of abortion clinics across the country continues” to break the law and puts women’s health at risk by “failing to keep clinics clean and train staff adequately,” according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The were reeking with violations and yet they remained open as a so-called health clinic. A “slew” of Whole Woman’s Health (WWH) abortion clinics did a miserable job of passing any inspection between 2011 up to the present and they reeked with violations, the Free Beacon also confirms. The news outlet was said to have worked “in conjunction with ‘And Then There Were None (ATTWN).'” Speaking to both sides of the debate, Arina Grossu from the Center for Human Dignity Director at the Family Research Council said, “Anyone who cares for women’s health and safety should want abortion facilities to be frequently inspected, no matter what their position is on abortion.” This was a disgusting place and unfit for practicing medicine. She reminds us that “Because this is a health and safety issue, and just because it has to do with a hot-button topic, does not mean that the abortion industry should get a free pass. Restaurants and tanning salons and vet clinics, they’re all more closely regulated than the abortion industry” This should outrage even the most pro-choice advocate the most. This is how the industry is treating those who “make the choice.” They are interested in the pregnant woman’s money and maybe furthering their agenda, but not about the health of the ladies who use their services. Findings showed that “instruments were unsterile and rusty.” Yes, rusty. Nothing sounds more appropriate to have inserted into the female body than rusty tools, or so it seems that those at WWH. It makes a person cringe just imagining it. Who knows if it was even washed properly after the last use? The report also found that “medication had expired, staff was inadequately trained, and the facilities were dirty enough to constitute health hazards.” Expired medicine can make a person deathly ill and, at the very least, be not as effective. That means that those taking antibiotics to ward off infection after an abortion were just lucky if they worked well enough. Nauseating facts. Patient records were found to have been “faulty” and consent seemed to be “disregarded.” On top of that, “undercover calls and visits from minors, and waiting period violations” were also uncovered. The McAllen location of the clinic ‘was in disrepair, with stains, cracks in exam tables and holes in the flooring.” Missing STACKS of deadly Fentanyl were even found and this could be a major issue in and of itself. “I was appalled at the state of the Austin Whole Woman’s Health. It looked more like a prison than an actual facility where patients went for healthcare. Disgusting does not do it justice,” said ATTWN founder Abby Johnson. She spoke about how these horrible conditions come to be when she disclosed, “What we see in the abortion industry across the country is that inspections are done, people come in, they’re cited for violations, they make a temporary plan to improve, a year later an inspector comes in, they cite them for the same violations, they make a temporary plan to improve … it’s the same cycle, over and over again.” The founder also said, “If we’re going to say that we’re for women, and we’re for protecting women, then this was sort of a common sense measure.” The Caller closes by showing that 220 clinics were guilty of “1,400 health and safety violations” according to facts presented by “a 2016 Americans United For Life (AUL) report.” The reality is, this really does transcend the debate about abortion and moves into the realm of medical soundness. No dentist, hospital, or even veterinary clinic would be allowed to run in such a shoddy manner and abortion clinics should be no different. Sources: The Daily Caller – The Free Beacon"
"124 Dead, Over 1,000 Infected As Health Officials Release Warning, Travel In Question",26 OCT 2017,5786,"Earlier this week, officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a plague warning for nine countries and territories in and near Africa in response to a massive outbreak in Madagascar, where over 120 people have died and roughly 1,000 have been infected (pictured above). Earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a plague warning for nine countries and territories in and near Africa. Apparently, there’s currently a huge outbreak in Madagascar, where over 120 people have died and roughly 1,000 have been infected. Officials are worried about the possibility of people visiting the huge African island and bringing the disease back home with them. Specifically, during a recent hearing about the plague outbreak in Madagascar at the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland, a spokesman for the WHO warned about the likelihood of the disease spreading to neighboring countries. “Nine countries and overseas territories have been identified as priority countries in the African region for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of having trade and travel links to Madagascar,” he explained, noting, “the risk of regional spread is moderate due to the occurrence of frequent travel by air and sea to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries.” According to reports, the nine countries included in the travel warning are Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La Réunion (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania. Despite the terrifying news, Ibrahima Soce Fall, who works as the Regional Emergency Director for Africa for the World Health Organization, believes that they’ll be able to contain the outbreak before it gets too bad. “I‘m confident that with the strong team we have on the ground, combined with more partners coming and health workers, we will be able very quickly to reverse the trend,” mentioned Fall while speaking with reporters about the deadly disease earlier this week. So far, the WHO has delivered roughly 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to help fight the disease. On top of that, the Red Cross has also been training hundreds of volunteers on the island to help publicise preventative measures. Although the reason for the outbreak is still under investigation, officials believe that a centuries-old tradition known as “famadihana,” otherwise known as “the turning of the bones” or “body turning,” may be to blame. It involves family members digging up the bones of their dead relatives, rewrapping them with a fresh cloth, and dancing with the newly wrapped corpses before eventually returning the remains to their graves. Officials believe that a centuries-old tradition known as “famadihana,” otherwise known as “the turning of the bones” or “body turning,” may be to blame for the recent outbreak of the plague in Madagascar. “If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for [the ritual], the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body,” explained Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s Health Ministry Chief of Staff. Shockingly, Madagascar isn’t the only place where the plague has recently shown up. Earlier this year in Arizona, for instance, numerous fleas tested positive for the bubonic plague, an extremely deadly disease that has killed millions of people throughout history, prompting widespread terror. Officials have since treated the area where they were found to try and stop the disease from spreading and are now closely monitoring the situation, but residents are still understandably worried beyond belief. Specifically, researchers at the Center for Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University found that fleas collected near Red Lake, Arizona, which is in Coconino County, tested positive for Yersinia pestis, a bacteria that causes the bubonic plague, earlier this month. Coconino County officials provided more details in a statement released online. Numerous fleas found near Red Lake, Arizona collected by researchers at the Center for Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University have tested positive for the bubonic plague. “Coconino County Public Health Services District (CCPHSD) officials confirmed that fleas collected in the Red Lake area, approximately five miles northeast of Williams, tested positive for plague (Yersinia pestis),” they began. “The burrows [where they were found] are being treated and the area will be closely monitored to determine if further action is required,” they continued, noting, “this is the first location in the County where fleas have tested positive for plague this year. Because the disease is endemic in Coconino County, there are likely additional locations with infected fleas. CCPHSD Environmental Health staff will continue to collect and test flea samples from locations throughout the County.” Later in the statement, the county officials pointed out how to tell if a human is infected with the disease. “Symptoms of plague in humans generally appear within two to six days following exposure and include the following: fever, chills, headache, weakness, muscle pain, and swollen lymph glands (called ‘buboes’) in the groin, armpits or limbs,” they explained, noting, “the disease can become septicemic (spreading throughout the bloodstream) and/or pneumonic (affecting the lungs), but is curable with proper antibiotic therapy if diagnosed and treated early.” Although it’s possible to cure the disease, there’s still a chance that a person who contracts the disease will die if they’re not treated soon enough. Because of this, public health officials should do everything they can to stop the disease from spreading. Failing to do so could result in catastrophe.  "
"BREAKING: Trump Issues “Public Health Emergency” As 64,000 Americans Die, Action Taken",26 OCT 2017,4709,"President Trump took a bold, measured step against the opioid crisis this week. Too many American lives have been destroyed by opiates. Trump’s actions will save countless lives. President Trump is expected to declare a public health emergency Thursday. The country is in the grip of a devastating opioid epidemic. Sickening numbers of Americans have had their lives destroyed by the powerful drugs as 64,000 died just last year. The left is already complaining. Trump originally promised to declare a national emergency, a promise that liberals now want to hold him to. White House officials, however, insist that declaring a public health emergency is a better decision. “Under the Stafford Act, as unfortunately, we have seen on multiple occasions over the last several months, the Stafford Act is designed to respond to mostly natural disasters that are (of a) very short time duration and a specific geographic region,” an official told CNN. The Stafford Act is designed to quickly free up funds after a national disaster. Public health crises, meanwhile, are suited for long-term problems. “Using FEMA funds to combat the opioid crisis would be… a little bit like asking an engineer to bake a cake,” said Rafael Lemaitre, the former communications director for the White House Drug Policy Office under Barack Obama. “I do think the public health service act is more appropriate route to take than the Stafford Act designation… I worked at FEMA for two years and dealt with multiple disasters. The Stafford Act is not structured to deal with a long-term, complicated public health crisis like the opioid crisis.” The opioid epidemic has been raging across the U.S. for decades. Barack Obama did little to address the issue. States need help. Record numbers of Americans are falling prey to severe addictions. Entire communities are being swallowed up in drug problems. The only way that people can get any relief is if state governments receive more funds. “I don’t understand why more resources aren’t flowing to help out a rural state like West Virginia,” West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinley complained. States that supported President Trump in the last election have been the hardest hit. Trump has been promising to help rectify the situation since before he was inaugurated. While still a candidate he promised to devote money and attention to the crisis. “When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you – we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves,” Trump told a crowd in Maine weeks last year. A problem as deeply entrenched as America’s opioid epidemic will take a multi-pronged approach to solve. Rehabilitation centers and more compassionate (or, alternatively, tougher) policing aren’t enough. Pharmaceutical companies and prescribers must be made part of the solution. Acting Health and Human Services Secretary Eric Hargan is the one who technically can declare a public health crisis. “One of the things that I think is most beneficial part of having a public health emergency is you really can marshal public support and then you can bring all the resources of the federal government to bear on it, bringing people from all of the agencies to combat the issue,” Tom Coderre, a former senior official in Obama’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration office, said. Congress has been fed up for a while. The opioid epidemic is one of the most important issues affecting their constituents, yet American politicians have been wasting their time with the Russia investigation. “We don’t want any more photo-ops,” Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, a member of the President’s commission on opioid addiction, raged to CNN Wednesday night. “I’m just speaking as an advocate… We don’t want any more visits to rehab centers and photo-ops, saying how courageous we are. Enough already. We want to save lives.” The commission has been bogged down by political realities. President Trump’s agenda is struggling to pass through Congress, most issues are still stuck on the Senate or House floor, or worse, haven’t been brought up at all. “Deaths are preventable, if someone has the medication then they are not going to not only have the craving, but if they do use, their chances of dying are dramatically reduced. If you had medication that could do that for any other illness that was killing this many people, you would make it available at every physician’s office in this country. Period,” Kennedy sighed."
"Multiple Errors Detected By Department Of Health, MN Officials Investigating Death",25 OCT 2017,1759,"Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Edward Ehlinger. Health investigators in Minnesota are questioning at least one nurse at an assisted living facility after a deceased patient who was scheduled to receive 42 doses of chemotherapy medications in a 12-week period only got 26. The patient, who was not identified, had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and was put on a strict schedule of treatments both at the Legacy of St. Michael and at home, Fox 9 reported. A Department of Health report revealed multiple errors in the patient’s treatment, including delays inputting information regarding administering the medication and dosage data into a computer system. The nurse at the focus of questioning reportedly told investigators that she “shadowed a staff nurse for two days before she was on her own,” but could not provide any training documents or a background check, Fox 9 reported. A facility spokesman has refuted the department’s findings about the nurse. “We respectfully disagree with some of the Department of Health’s findings in this matter and have filed an appeal with documented facts to the department, including documentation that the nurse identified as not having a current license, in fact, did have a current license, was trained to administer medications, had a completed background study and was tested for tuberculosis,” the spokesman told Fox 9. The patient’s treatment was scheduled to start in September and continue through April, though lab work showed that the cancer had progressed with one provider saying “the chemotherapy never had a chance to work.” A relative told Fox 9 that they were notified of one instance in which a dose was missed. No criminal charges have been filed, Fox 9 reported. H/T: Fox News"
Mega Retailers Pull California Crops From Stores As Deadly Bacteria Threatens Public Health,23 OCT 2017,840,"California is adamant about government healthcare but lax concerning real public health threats. Fears of listeria has resulted in the voluntarily recall of vegetables from more than 20 brands. The products include Trader Joe’s Kohlrabi Salad Blend, Walmart Broccoli Slaw, and Archer Farms’ Brussels Sprouts. All the products are from Mann Packing of Salinas, California. Mann Packing says it is issuing this recall in response to a single positive result found on one of its products during random sampling by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. To date, public health officials have not reported any illnesses associated with these products. The recalled products were distributed throughout the United States and Canada with “best if used by” dates from October 11 to October 20 listed on the front of the packaging. H/T: ABC 13 Houston"
San Diego Health Officials Discover “Patient Zero” In Deadly Outbreak,20 OCT 2017,2086,"The massive efforts continue to get the outbreak of Hepatitis A under control. As San Diego’s hepatitis A outbreak has continued to grow, so has a fascination about the identity and importance of “patient zero,” the first person believed to be infected in a surge of illness that has now killed 19 people. At first unwilling to say much about this mysterious person, San Diego County health officials disclosed twice during public meetings in late September that the apparent first patient — what epidemiologists often call an outbreak’s “index case” — was a homeless man who tested positive for hepatitis infection in East County. Dr. Eric McDonald, chief of the county’s Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch, reiterated in an email this week that this man was treated in a La Mesa hospital and “when interviewed said that the exposure period was mainly in El Cajon.” Further details on exactly where in El Cajon, and where else patient zero might have lived, have not been forthcoming and a lack of genetic analysis due to his unknown whereabouts have made absolute confirmation of his first-patient status impossible. “Patient zero coming from a different part of the county speaks to how we need to have every part of the community stepping up to solve this problem,” said James Haug, a downtown condo owner and president of the East Village Assn., a business improvement district. There’s been at least a small impact on downtown business: A cookie convention slated to hold its event at the San Diego Convention Center in September chose to withdraw until the outbreak is deemed over, though local officials challenged whether hepatitis was the true rationale. Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter business association, said there’s no hard evidence that there’s been an effect on business. While he said it’s “good to know” that the first patient may have been in East County, downtown still has a large population of homeless people and it’s important to continue getting that at-risk population immunized against the virus.

"Forget Climate Warming, Global Health Expert Reveals REAL Danger To Earth",20 OCT 2017,8392,"Epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, has a new warning for the health of everyone. Environmental pollution — from filthy air to contaminated water — is killing more people every year than all war and violence in the world. More than smoking, hunger or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. One out of every six premature deaths in the world in 2015 — about 9 million — could be attributed to disease from toxic exposure, according to a major study released Thursday in the Lancet medical journal. The financial cost from pollution-related death, sickness and welfare is equally massive, the report says, costing some $4.6 trillion in annual losses — or about 6.2 percent of the global economy. “There’s been a lot of study of pollution, but it’s never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or climate change,” said epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and the lead author of the report. The report marks the first attempt to pull together data on disease and death caused by all forms of pollution combined. “Pollution is a massive problem that people aren’t seeing because they’re looking at scattered bits of it,” Landrigan said. Experts say the 9 million premature deaths the study found was just a partial estimate, and the number of people killed by pollution is undoubtedly higher and will be quantified once more research is done and new methods of assessing harmful impacts are developed. Areas like Sub-Saharan Africa have yet to even set up air pollution monitoring systems. Soil pollution has received scant attention. And there are still plenty of potential toxins still being ignored, with less than half of the 5,000 new chemicals widely dispersed throughout the environment since 1950 having been tested for safety or toxicity. “In the West, we got the lead out of the gasoline, so we thought lead was handled. We got rid of the burning rivers, cleaned up the worst of the toxic sites. And then all of those discussions went into the background” just as industry began booming in developing nations, said Richard Fuller, head of the global toxic watchdog Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists, policymakers and public health experts who contributed to the 51-page report. “To some extent, these countries look to the West for examples and discussion, and we’d dropped it,” Fuller said. Asia and Africa are the regions putting the most people at risk, the study found, while India tops the list of individual countries. One out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5 million, was attributed to pollution. China’s environment was the second deadliest, with more than 1.8 million premature deaths, or one in five, blamed on pollution-related illness, the study found. Several other countries such Bangladesh, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti also see nearly a fifth of their premature deaths caused by pollution. Still, many poorer countries have yet to make pollution control a priority, experts say. India has taken some recent actions, such as tightening vehicle and factory emission standards and occasionally limiting the number of cars on New Delhi’s roads. But they have done little about crop burning, garbage fires, construction dust or rampant use of the dirtiest fossil fuels. A court ban on firework sales before the Diwali festival didn’t stop New Delhi residents from firing rockets and lighting crackers throughout Thursday night. They awoke Friday morning to acrid, smoke-filled skies and levels of dangerous, lung-clogging particulate matter known as PM2.5 that went beyond 900 parts per million — 90 times the recommended limit by the World Health Organization, and 22 times higher than India’s own limits. “Even though better pollution norms are coming in, still the pollution levels are continuously increasing,” said Shambhavi Shukla, a research associate with the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment, which was not involved in the Lancet study. To reach its figures on the overall global pollution burden, the study’s authors used methods outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, as well as with air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease, an ongoing study run by institutions including the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Even the conservative estimate of 9 million pollution-related deaths is one-and-a-half times higher than the number of people killed by smoking, three times the number killed by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, more than six times the number killed in road accidents, and 15 times the number killed in war or other forms of violence, according to GBD tallies. It is most often the world’s poorest who suffer, the study found. The vast majority of pollution-related deaths — 92 percent — occur in low- or middle-income countries, where policymakers are chiefly concerned with developing their economies, lifting people out of poverty and building basic infrastructure. Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels. In wealthier countries where overall pollution is not as rampant, it is still the poorest communities that are more often exposed, the report says. “What people don’t realize is that pollution does damage to economies. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after” — which is also costly, Fuller said. “There is this myth that finance ministers still live by, that you have to let industry pollute or else you won’t develop,” he said. “It just isn’t true.” The report cites EPA research showing that the U.S. has gained some $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on controlling air pollution since 1970, when Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, one of the world’s most ambitious environmental laws. Removing lead from gasoline has earned the U.S. economy another $6 trillion cumulatively since 1980, according to studies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some experts cautioned, however, that the report’s economic message was murky. Reducing the pollution quantified in the report might impact production, and so would not likely translate into gains equal to the $4.6 trillion in economic losses. The report “highlights the social and economic justice of this issue,” said Marc Jeuland, associate professor with the Sanford School of Public Policy and the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University, who was not involved in the study. Without more concrete evidence for how specific policies might lead to economic gains, “policymakers will often find it difficult to take action, and this report thus only goes part way in making the case for action,” he said. Jeuland also noted that, while the report counts mortality by each pollutant, there are possible overlaps — for example, someone exposed to both air pollution and water contamination — and actions to address one pollutant may not reduce mortality. “People should be careful not to extrapolate from the U.S. numbers on net (economic) benefits because the net effects of pollution control will not be equivalent across locations,” he said. The study’s conclusions on the economic cost of pollution measure lost productivity and health care costs, while also considering studies measuring people’s “willingness to pay” to reduce the probability of dying. While these types of studies yield estimates at best, they are used by many governments and economists trying to understand how societies value individual lives. While there has never been an international declaration on pollution, the topic is gaining traction. The World Bank in April declared that reducing pollution, in all forms, would now be a global priority. And in December, the United Nations will host its first pollution conference. “The relationship between pollution and poverty is very clear,” said Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, lead environmental specialist at the World Bank. “And controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to malnutrition. The linkages can’t be ignored.” H/T: WRIC"
Washington D.C. Teenagers Face Growing Epidemic As Newest Health Report Released,13 OCT 2017,5726,"CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald. The agency´s new studies revealed that Washington, D.C. has the highest rate of reported sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers in the United States. In an unexpected twist, information that promises to raise a lot of concern has come out as new studies revealed that Washington, D.C. has the highest rate of reported sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers in the United States. Believe it or not, the worst detail is that it’s not even close. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clearly shows that teens in the District of Columbia report suffering from numerous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) at a rate of over 55 cases per thousand. Naturally, we’re talking about a serious issue that started some years ago without having the proper measures to prevent it. The data reveals that by contrast, Utah –which is the state with the lowest teen STD rate- has just over 10 cases of STDs for every 1,000. Apparently, other states with notably high reported STD rates among the young population include Louisiana (which have over 40 cases per 1,000), Alabama (also over 40 cases per 1,000) and Mississippi (which have about 38 cases per 1,000). A couple of weeks ago, the CDC revealed that Americans were infected with more than 2 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and Chlamydia last year, which represents the highest number of these sexually transmitted diseases ever reported. The study conducted by the CDC clearly shows that the great throng of STDs from which America’s teens suffer includes gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, Chlamydia, and something called trichomonas vaginalis. In addition, the data revealed there’s also chancroid, pelvic inflammatory’s disease, and human papillomavirus, which is commonly known as HPV. What seems to be the most revealing detail from the study, and the element that promises to raise the highest controversy, is that the data from the CDC shows that sexually transmitted diseases are way more common among gay and bisexual males. According to a CDC report on adolescent and school health, “Young gay and bisexual males have disproportionately high rates of HIV, syphilis, and other sexually transmitted diseases.” Additionally somewhat counterintuitively, the report showed that bisexual females and adolescent lesbian are more likely to have ever been pregnant than their heterosexual peers. According to a CDC report on adolescent and school health, “Young gay and bisexual males have disproportionately high rates of HIV, syphilis, and other sexually transmitted diseases.” A couple of weeks ago, the CDC revealed that Americans were infected with more than 2 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and Chlamydia last year, which represents the highest number of these sexually transmitted diseases ever reported. In addition to an undeniable display of irresponsibility from people who transmitted the diseases and those who decided to have sexual intercourse without any kind of protection, the Obama administration dedicated weak efforts to solve this issue and prevent a major extension. Regarding these concerning statistics, the director of CDC’s Division of STD Prevention, Dr. Gail Bolan, said that they clearly need to reverse this disturbing trend before this issue reach even worse scenarios. In addition, the specialist explained that the CDC cannot do this by itself and need every community in the United States to be aware that this risk is out there, and help educate the citizens on how to avoid it in the most effective way. In addition to an undeniable display of irresponsibility from people who transmitted the diseases and those who decided to have sexual intercourse without any kind of protection, the Obama administration dedicated weak efforts to solve this issue and prevent a major extension. Recently, the agency’s annual Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report revealed that more than 1.6 million of the new cases were from chlamydia, while 470,000 were from gonorrhea and almost 28,000 were primary and secondary syphilis. According to the CDC, the most troubling element of this last case is that these are the most infectious stages of the disease. In addition, another problem of the whole picture is that while all of these diseases can be cured by antibiotics, many people go undiagnosed and untreated. Regarding syphilis, the agency showed that their new data reveals that rates of this potentially deadly disease increased almost 18 percent between the years 2015 and 2016, with most of the cases being in men who have sex with men. However, there was also a concerning rise of the disease among women who pass it on to their newborns. #ConfessToSomethingStupid

Wasington D.C. Dominates New STD Per Capita Rankings From The CDC https://t.co/yqttRwhDkw — Stavros (@ubipages) September 28, 2017 Apparently, only those three STDs and HIV are required by the law to be reported to the agency by physicians. In fact, when anyone includes herpes and more of the dozens of diseases which can be transmitted sexually but which are not tracked, the agency estimates there are more than 20 million new cases of STDs in America each year. The most disturbing element of this whole situation is that at least half occur in young people ages 15 to 24. Regarding this whole picture, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors David Harvey told that STDs are definitely out of control with enormous health implications for the American people. In addition, Harvey explained that if not treated, Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis can have serious consequences, such as neurological issues, infertility, and an increased risk for HIV."
"WATCH: Vegas Health Ranger Goes Live, DEMANDS FBI To Tell Truth About Shooter",10 OCT 2017,5788,"The Health Ranger, Mike Adams, is showing that the intelligence officials are not to be trusted because their narrative is crumbling and they are desperate to keep the truth hidden The Las Vegas Massacre has scarred the nation and left dozens killed, hundreds injured, and millions confused. The narrative produced by our trusted government has been less than fulfilling, if not downright insulting. Their claims that a lone gunman carried out this absolute travesty is coming undone as independent journalists are working to uncover the truth. Now Mike Adams, known as the Health Ranger, a well known and respectable journalist, is demanding the FBI release more information to the American public. It did not take long for both intelligence officials and media pundits to quickly get in front of the cameras and declare this to be the doing of a crazy lone wolf attacker. This is a stereotypical message displayed by these outlets when an atrocity takes place and a lone body is found. They are trying to say that a 64-year-old man, with apparently no violent history or signs of aggression, suddenly snapped and emptied almost a thousand rounds into a crowd of innocents. Scarred Country Music Fans Fear for their Lives as Gun Fire Rained Down onto them from what seemed like more than one angle This message must be questioned on the most basic level even though there are literally thousands of questions that are stemming from this incident. I have shot guns my entire life with my father including rifles, shotguns, and pistols and since my father is close to the same age as Stephen Paddock, it made my head spin. My father has shot guns with me for a long time and he has never been able to quite keep up in terms of the damage that recoil does to an elderly man’s shoulders. If he can not shoot more than 30-50 shots with out feeling tremendous pain in his shoulders, then how was this man, with no military experience, able to literally fires hundreds if not close to a thousand? Just this question alone is worth asking and yet many more and concerning questions have been silenced and labeled as conspiracy theories simply to discredit any intelligent thoughts that are being produced by independent and conservative news sources. It is simple questions like the one I produced above that make people wonder why the FBI is not disclosing more information. Mike Adams is just one of many journalists trying to get to the truth that someone or some organization is desperate to hide. In the video below, Adams details how the lone gunman story is just not acceptable. He labels and identifies clearly the sounds of at least two different weapon systems from videos from witnesses, and yet this is nowhere to be seen on main stream news outlets. Why was the media so quick to label Paddock as a lone gunman and yet when video evidence is provided displaying the clear sounds of two different rifles the media is silent? Tom Fitton, the president of government watchdog group Judicial Watch, covers these stories closely and now he is even stating that the official narrative is not making sense. Fitton usually works publicly to obtain FOIA requests and information that is important to the American people but now he has added more mystery to the entire situation by declaring his distrust for the FBI. I don't trust the @FBI. — Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) October 4, 2017 Everyday more and more details emerge around the shooter, his motives, possible accomplices, and even the possibility that Paddock was not the shooter. It was not long ago when sources in the FBI were declaring that Paddock had ANTIFA literature in his room and yet ISIS claimed Paddock as their own. The FBI was extremely quick, too quick, to denounce the ISIS connection and yet no official statement has been released regarding any radical Marxist terrorist connection. If anything about this horrendous tragedy has been made clear, it is that the official narrative that is produced immediately after the attack is not to be trusted on face value. Sure, a multi-millionaire who labels himself as a professional gambler with no gun experience could snap and slaughter dozens of people but I do not buy it. If that is the case then the FBI should have no trouble showing the public footage from the hotel of Paddock carrying up his items to his room by himself, and yet this is no footage has been released. Paddock, 64, spent months preparing arms and must have had shooting practice and yet he carried out his vicious assault in old man loafers? Simple details like this are worth questioning the lone gunman narrative It seems more likely with each passing day that there is a conspiracy afoot regarding the Las Vegas Massacre. Videos highlighting the sounds of two gunman as well as eye witness victims adamantly claiming there were multiple shooters are enough to make anyone question the legitimacy of the FBI’s intentions. Just to express my first amendment right, I am going to share a theory that has particular weight behind it simply to invoke any other questions that one might have. It could be possible that this was a gun deal gone horribly wrong involving dangerous and hostile clients. It is possible that Paddock could have been an undercover agent posing as an arms dealer to either entrap or track dangerous criminals. This would explain the secrecy on the part of the FBI as well as the amount of dangerous weapons found in the room, however if Paddock’s cover was blown and if the clients were dangerous terrorists then anything could have happened next. The simple fact of the matter is, the American people are being lied to and we are sick of fronting the bill for agencies just to lie to us. Watch Below as Mike Adams Explains and Shows How the Official Narrative is Not Adding Up"
$5 MILLION: Amount Wasted By Government As Obama IRS Pushed Healthcare Bill,3 OCT 2017,4400,"Barack Obama’s IRS was either incompetent or entirely corrupt. The agency spent a whopping $5 million on a letter writing campaign intended to pressure Obamacare opponents into ponying up. That’s just one of the scandals that tarnished the IRS’ reputation while Obama was in office. Ex-President Barack Obama led a corrupt IRS. The powerful agency became embroiled in multiple scandals throughout Obama’s eight years in the White House. New evidence of corruption and government waste has just been released. A conservative watchdog group has discovered the Obama’s IRS agents wasted a whopping $5 million on a simple letter-writing campaign. The agency hoped to shame people who hadn’t yet purchased Obamacare coverage. “Attached are drafts of the letters that IRS will send to selected taxpayers who paid a penalty for failure to have coverage or who claimed an exemption from the coverage requirement for tax year 2015,” Janet McCubbin, director of individual taxation at the IRS, said. “As you know, we are planning to send several different versions of the letter to see which types of messages work best.” What isn’t explained is why it cost millions of dollars to draft up a few form letters. They weren’t creating poetry to rival Shakespeare; they wrote bland notices that were probably thrown out before they were read. Obama eroded the public’s faith in the IRS. “The law requires people to have a minimum level of health coverage, qualify for an exemption, or pay a penalty when they file their taxes,” one of the letter’s read. “Our records show you claimed an exemption from the health coverage requirement when you filed your 2015 taxes. If you or someone in your family doesn’t have health insurance or an exemption next year, you’ll likely owe a penalty for 2017. We are writing to make sure you know how you can avoid this penalty by signing up for health insurance or getting an exemption.” In other versions, the author focuses on scaring people with the amount they would have to pay if they refuse to buy “proper” coverage. “The penalty for not having any health-coverage or an exemption in 2017 will be at least $695 per adult and $347 per child (up to $2,085 per family), and could be more, depending on your income,” the letters read. American families are struggling. Most people can’t afford to pay high premiums attached to Obamacare. It’s bad enough that the Obama administration failed to provide the country with adequate healthcare, but to find out that he used a federal agency to shame struggling citizens is disturbing. “So now we have more evidence of more Obama IRS abuses targeting innocent Americans—all in the name of Obamacare,” said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton. “No wonder it took a federal lawsuit and court order to get these documents—as they show the Obama White House and its agencies were happy to threaten and treat Americans like lab rats in order to bolster Obamacare.” The Obama administration needed to pressure people into purchasing Obamacare because people realized that it was a terrible system. Fitton’s group is responsible for uncovering the scandal. Obama’s administration was the opposite of transparent. The Obamacare letters scandal isn’t even the worse activity that the IRS engaged in under Obama’s direction. “In May 2013, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released a report indicating the targeting involved delaying the processing of applications by certain conservative groups and requesting information from them that was later deemed unnecessary,” CNN reports. The Obama administration openly targeted conservatives. Groups that included “patriot” or “tea party” in their name received more scrutiny from the IRS than those that didn’t. It’s illegal for the IRS to unfairly target people or groups, but that didn’t stop Team Obama. Americans already mistrusted the IRS. Taxes are too high and wages are too low. People are having a hard time supporting their families. Obama’s machinations might have far-reaching consequences. He tried to erode the public’s trust in Washington. “Under… Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House’s Behavioral Sciences Team created a $5 million program to target and pressure those who refused Obamacare and either decided to pay a penalty instead or were exempt from being forced to purchase coverage,” the Washington Free Beacon reports."
BREAKING: Health And Human Services Secretary Resigns Amid Plane Scandal,29 SEP 2017,2380,"Secretary Price has resigned. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has just announced that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has offered his resignation and President Trump accepted. The president had announced he would announce Price’s fate today and now that decision has been made for him. When asked about the situation earlier today, the president told reporters; “He’s a very fine man, but we’re going to make a decision sometime tonight.” As reported yesterday, Price has been drowning in the scandal of his outrageous spending of taxpayer money by flying in private jets. It is likely that his resignation is related to that controversy. He is alleged to have made at least 24 trips on private planes instead of flying commercial. Senate Dems call out Tom Price for hypocrisy in use of private jets: https://t.co/eGWGf0VG5w pic.twitter.com/aFuR6nIfj8 — The Hill (@thehill) September 28, 2017 Private flights are allowed for government employees only when commercial ones are not available and that was not the case for most of his trips. The total for his domestic flights was approximately $300,000 and further reports show a possible $500,000 for trips to Africa, Europe, and Asia. Price stepped up yesterday and issued an apology which many felt was too little, too late. He stated, “the taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes,” and was said to be writing a check for $51,887.31 to the U.S. Treasury to cover the costs. According to Politico, the cost for all of his flights could be closer to $1 million. NEWS: In a statement, HHS Secretary Tom Price apologizes for using private charter plane flights for official business. pic.twitter.com/JoPZok00LW — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) September 28, 2017 Naturally, Democrats took the chance to use the scandal against President Trump. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) said, “There could not be a clearer statement of the Trump administration’s priorities.” They conveniently ignored the fact that the president was likely on his way to firing Price before the resignation was tendered. President Trump had told reporters earlier in the week that he was “not happy” with Price’s conduct. The announcement from Huckabee Sander also reported that President Trump will appoint the Deputy Assistant Secretary Don Wright to serve as Acting Secretary Sources: Fox News – Teddy Stick – Politico"
"California Public Health Officials Find Record Rise, Golden State Crisis Looming",28 SEP 2017,4774,"Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, issued a grave warning this week. STD rates in the state are rising out of control, despite officials’ best attempts to curb the crisis. Americans are battling against a new health crisis. Sexually transmitted diseases are rising at an alarming rate. California, in particular, has been devastated. Chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, every major STD is coming back with a vengeance. The crisis is alarming because there’s no real reason for it. Proper self-care can completely eliminate your chances of being infected with an STD. If you do become sick, a simple course of antibiotics is usually enough. “We should not be seeing steady increases in curable infections,” Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a UCLA professor of medicine and public health, said. “These are readily detected by routine tests and they are easily cured by antibiotics.” So what’s going on? Experts are unsure. African Americans, young people, and homosexual men are diagnosed with STDs at much higher rates than the rest of the population. Sexual freedom and reliable birth control have led to a decrease in condom use among young women, while homosexual men can now protect themselves from HIV. STDs have a real effect on public health. Californians are experiencing a massive increase in rates of congenital syphilis. “Countries like Cuba and Thailand have eliminated mother-child transmission [of syphilis], so to see an increase in the United States is frightening,” Klausner said. Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a UCLA professor of medicine and public health, believes that the rise in STDs is one of the biggest threats facing our society. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, agrees. “For the first time in many years, we are now seeing more cases of babies born with congenital syphilis than babies born with HIV,” Harvey said. “It means that women are not getting access to prenatal care, testing, and treatment for syphilis. It’s an unconscionable situation in America today.” If something isn’t done, California is at risk of seeing a swath of serious birth defects. Other STDS, like chlamydia and gonorrhea, are also dangerous. Chlamydia can destroy a woman’s reproductive system while doctors believe that gonorrhea has become resistant to antibiotics. “STDs are out of control with enormous health implications for Americans,” said Harvey. “If not treated, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis can have serious consequences, such as infertility, neurological issues, and an increased risk for HIV,” It’s a tricky crisis to solve because everyone already knows what needs to be done. They’re just not doing it. Practicing safe sex would eliminate the problem. If people would commit to using condoms with untested sexual partners, the crisis would die in a couple years. California is experiencing higher rates of STD transmission than almost any other state. According to Harvey: “”Several factors are fueling the STD epidemic… Funding cutbacks for prevention, education and healthcare programs, an on-going debate about sex education for young people, with cutbacks in that arena, particularly from this administration, and a rise in social media dating apps have all contributed to the rise.” California officials plan to hold public health courses to keep people informed of their danger. It’s believed that easy access to free condoms would help as well. It seems gross to have the government pay for people’s contraception, but really, they already are. Millions of dollars of taxpayer funds are being expended to fight STDS. “Unfortunately, STDs carry enormous stigma in this country, and it’s hard for people to come forward for treatment,” Harvey continued. “Ironically, HIV is an STD, but we have a very visible community who advocates and works to tell stories about the impact of HIV on people’s lives. We don’t have that going for us with gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. We need a network of voices that say it’s OK to get help.” It’s going to take a coordinated effort from state and federal officials to curb the crisis. Education isn’t enough. People know that STDs exist, what they need to learn is how dangerous they are. The Center for Disease Control says that STDs represent a huge threat to society’s health. “Clearly we need to reverse this disturbing trend,” said Dr. Gail Bolan, director of CDC’s Division of STD Prevention. “The CDC cannot do this alone… The fact that so many of these diseases are asymptomatic, which few tell-tale signals, mean that men and women aren’t getting into their doctor to be tested…We need to get the word out that everyone needs a yearly checkup. And we need to re-educate physicians to look for signs of such ‘ancient’ diseases as syphilis.”"
Health Officials Highly Concerned As “Highest Number Ever” Recorded In Newest Report,27 SEP 2017,4301,"CDC officials are very worried about the new trend. Condoms. Vending machines in most bathrooms charge, what….a dollar? Common sense says that if a person is old enough to have sex then they are old to put four quarters into a vending machine. Leftwing darling Planned Parenthood hands out anonymous protection like Tic Tacs, too, so they are pretty easy to acquire. Most STDs are hampered greatly by condom use and in this day and age, in the U.S., there is no reason for diseases of this nature to be on the rise. Sadly, they are. Yahoo News confirms that “more than two million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis” have been diagnosed and documented and that means a surge like the U.S. has never suffered before. That is not hyperbole, either. This is “the highest number ever” (of people too dumb to buy a condom), according to the Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report that came out today from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This nightmare inducing condition is on the rise the U.S.A. Thankfully, 1.6 million of the cases in 2016 were chlamydia, a very common bacterial infection which targets men and women equally but which can be more dangerous for ladies and unnoticeable to men in some instances. While curable with antibiotics, it can lead other issues according to doctors. While that was the most common finding and it may seem to be “good” news compared to killers like AIDS, it must be remembered that the same unsafe practices that lead to chlamydia also lead to far more serious things like genital warts which can cause cancer. AIDS, hepatitis, and a great number of ailments can be acquired by skipping safe sex practices, something that has been taught in schools for over 25 years. Gonorrhea is on the rise also among both sexes but men are being hit the hardest and have suffered a 22% rise in reported cases. Some states are so risky that it is a wonder that anyone still has sex there! Actually, there were 470,000 new cases of the dreaded disease reported, often among men who engage in homosexual sex, a fact missing from most of the gay pride parades that are being forced upon every city. Gonorrhea reports are “particularly alarming” for the CDC because the drugs that have worked to stop the STD are starting to not work any longer as it becomes resistant to treatment. That can open the door for a terrible problem that could rival AIDS in severity if not halted. Syphilis, a disease that stole mobster Al Capone’s mind before it took his life, saw its number climb to 28,000, an 18% rise from 2015. This increase is also seen among gay or bisexual men, so this seems to be the demographic that is shunning proper condom use more than any other, making them a greater risk to frolic with. Women saw an increase of syphilis hit 36% and 600 cases have hit newborns born with the horrid condition, up a full 28%. This has caused “more than 40 deaths and severe health complications among newborns,” the report tells us. “Every baby born with syphilis represents a tragic systems failure,” said Esaid Gail Bolan, director of CDC’s Division of STD Prevention. The youth, contrary to what many think, are the MOST at risk. Popular wisdom tells us otherwise, which is unfortunate. “All it takes is a simple STD test and antibiotic treatment to prevent this enormous heartache and help assure a healthy start for the next generation of Americans,” Bolan added. Then again, if they were too lackadaisical to buy a condom, what are the chances that they will be responsible enough to get tested? While most of these conditions can be easily cured (currently) with antibiotics, if they are not, “infertility, life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth in infants, and increased risk for HIV transmission” can be the outcome. Showing why a round of antibiotics should not be counted on, Jonathan Mermin, director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention said, “Increases in STDs are a clear warning of a growing threat. STDs are a persistent enemy, growing in number, and outpacing our ability to respond.” So there it is: Americans are too sexually charged to spend a few moments and $1 ensuring that the act is at least safe, if not moral. We have really fallen that far. Source: Yahoo News"
"Washington State Health Officials Brace For Worst, First Two Cases Reported As More Likely",26 SEP 2017,4675,"Spokane County Officials have declared two active cases of West Nile Virus affecting citizens, with a possible third case still being determined. Two cases of West Nile infections have sprung up in Spokane County, Washington over the last couple of days, but health officials are concerned as more are likely incoming. These cases have been mostly affecting elderly citizens who may or may not have compromised immune systems. The virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans and there is no vaccine for the illness, but the symptoms are easy to recognize. A man in his 60s has been hospitalized and quarantined after being diagnosed with an early stage of the virus and a 50-year old-man has been recovering at home after his hospitalization. West Nile virus is a dangerous, and sometimes deadly, illness that largely travels from mosquitoes to humans and usually affects the elderly. The symptoms are easy to identify after a couple of days of being infected as they are confusion, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains, fever, and nausea. Although the disease has been found in horses and birds, it is more worrying that elders are subject to the disease because they are more susceptible to dying from a severe case. A lab tech studies a mosquito larva in order to try and combat West Nile Virus The virus was first detected in Washington about 10 years ago and has been a yearly struggle with citizens ever since. Idaho has had a much larger problem that has resulted in 1,000 cases of infection or full blown virus as well as the deaths of 23 people. Currently there are 10 cases in Idaho that are taking place and five of them involve the worst scenario for West Nile virus as it will begin to affect the brain and spinal cord. The disease can not be transmitted via human to human contact as it usually requires an insect, mosquito, to draw the infected blood and transmit it to another human. It was originally believed to only affect birds slightly but more developed and harmful mutations occurred which lead to the virus becoming lethal to birds. It is a common virus found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and West Asia but when it is introduced to an area is when the biggest danger is presented. West Nile Virus is spread by mosquitoes and not from human to human contact. West Nile Virus was first discovered in New York, USA in 1999 and has quickly spread across the continent resulting in literally thousands of cases. West Nile Virus has made its way across the country to the west coast as well as heading northwards to affect Canadians and reports have even shown its presence has begun to plague Venezuela. Although the symptoms are common and easy to recognize, up to 80% of those carrying the virus would never know they had it. Despite the virus only being transmitted from mosquitoes to humans and the majority of severe cases involve the elderly, it is still important to know the symptoms and causes of such a devastating and trivial sickness. Mosquitoes pick up the infection from birds and from there the virus remains inactive until contact with another being, be it an animal or a human. There have been no recorded cases of a human contracting the virus from another human and when proper precautions are met, nurses and other staff are safe from becoming infected. This info-graphic can be used to explain how mosquitoes first get the virus and then how it is then transmitted to humans Drastic news has recently come out of California as the death toll for West Nile Virus climbs to six for L.A. county alone.  These individuals affected likely had compromised immune systems or were so elderly that the virus managed to affect their brains or spinal cords. The situation in California is so severe that L.A. County officials have stepped up their game to spread the awareness of West Nile Virus and that the symptoms are sometimes non-existent. The county has advised that people should take mosquito bites more seriously as nearly 100 cases have occurred in L.A. County alone. Thankfully the season of Autumn is right around the corner in the United States and with the change of weather, leaves, and jackets, it usually brings about another joy, football, but not this year. However, when the cold winds blow the mosquito goes away and it is a happy time for all who enjoy being outside without the nuisance of mosquitoes trying to drink our blood and spread illnesses. People above the age of 50 should still be cautious and those who have received a transplant are also more suseptable to falling ill but hopefully with Autumn arriving, medical institutions will be able to see the end of West Nile Virus season."
Democrat Senator Unleashes Health Care Tirade Before Making Humiliating Confession,22 SEP 2017,4802,"A Democratic Senator recently humiliated himself after he went on a rant against a newly submitted Obamacare replacement bill during an interview with a reporter from CNN, only to later admit that he didn’t actually read the proposed legislation he was criticizing (pictured above). Earlier this week, a Democratic Senator spoke out against a newly submitted Obamacare replacement bill during an interview with a reporter from CNN. When pressed, however, he ended up admitting live on air that he didn’t actually read the proposed legislation he was criticizing.  Specifically, while on CNN’s “New Day,” Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) humiliated himself after the show’s host, Alisyn Camerota, asked him what he thought about a revised health care bill, known as the “Graham-Cassidy” bill due to the fact that it is sponsored by Sens. Dr. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) speaking with Alisyn Camerota on CNN’s “New Day” about a revised health care bill, known as the “Graham-Cassidy” bill due to the fact that it is sponsored by Sens. Dr. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Prior to questioning him about the legislation, Camerota played a short clip of Cassidy promoting the legislation. “Under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson, more people would have coverage and we protect those with pre-existing conditions,” claimed Cassidy in the brief recording. “States like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri – there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those and those states who have been passed by Obamacare,” he added. Sen. Dr. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), one of the sponsors of the “Graham-Cassidy” healthcare bill, is convinced that if the proposed legislation is passed, more people would have coverage and those with pre-existing conditions will be protected. After playing the clip of Cassidy, Camerota then asked Whitehouse what his thoughts were on the legislation. “There’s not much of that that’s true. For starters, you don’t protect pre-existing conditions when you allow states to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, which this bill does,” he replied. “Second, he focuses only on the states that get money under his bill, not the ones like my state that have that money taken from them to give to the other states,” continued Whitehouse, noting, “it’s basically a raid on blue states and states that adopted the Medicaid expansion, to take money to those states. So it’s really unfair just to pick out those states and say that you’re winning.” Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) criticizing a revised health care bill, known as the “Graham-Cassidy” bill due to the fact that it is sponsored by Sens. Dr. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), during a recent interview with CNN despite the fact that he didn’t actually read it. To clarify, Camerota asked him if he was suggesting that Cassidy was being “intentionally misleading.” In response, Whitehouse said, “well, I don’t know what his intent is, but he sure as heck is being factually misleading.” Satisfied with his answer, Camerota then went on to ask about what the government’s plan is to combat the opioid crisis currently plaguing the country. But before getting into the specifics, she asked, “have you read the Graham-Cassidy bill?” After a brief delay, Whitehouse replied, “I’ve seen reviews of it. I haven’t read the language of it.” By saying this, he’s basically admitting that he didn’t read the bill, which suggests that he doesn’t really know what he’s talking about even though he just got finished complaining about how horrible it is. Despite the fact that some people oppose the healthcare bill, many others support it. For example, shortly after the legislation was proposed, it was publicly endorsed by numerous governors. One of the governors to come out in support of it was Asa Hutchinson (R), the Governor of Arkansas, who reasoned that “the decisions about individual mandates, mandated benefits, and all the other decisions the ACA moved to Washington are best made at the state level by governors who understand the unique needs of their states.” When asked to expand on why she supports the legislation, Hutchinson mentioned that she is convinced it will help the sustainability of future health care programs. Specifically, she said, “Graham-Cassidy is putting federal spending on a budget. That is the fiscal discipline the federal government and states both need to ensure the sustainability of Medicaid and other state healthcare programs.” If a lawmaker wants their opinion to be taken seriously, then they need to read the actual legislation they’re considering. This is because, by reading the actual bill themselves, they’re able to come to their own genuine conclusions instead of simply parroting the opinions of others."
"“Two Or Three More”: GOP Senator Revives Healthcare Debate, News Has Dems Squirming",18 SEP 2017,5062,"Senator Bill Cassidy says that he only needs two or three more republicans to get on board for the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill to pass and finally end Obamacare. He’s trying to push a vote before the end of the month. It seems that at least a few U.S. Senators want to keep their jobs. A push to move Obamacare repeal through the Senate is being headed by Bill Cassidy, who on Friday night, rallied support for his bill and got 49 members to tentatively support it. According to the GOP lawmaker, there’s not a hard whip count, but at least that many people have expressed their “ayes.” Cassidy is confident that he’ll get the other two votes that would fast track the repeal measure he crafted along with Lindsey Graham through the Senate. The simple majority would at least demonstrate that the GOP is listening to its constituents. However, opponents argue that it’s just Obamacare repackaged. One notable dissenter is Rand Paul. He tweeted that he would not support a measure that “keeps 90 percent of Obamacare in place,” dubbing the bill “Obamacare lite.” The measure would essentially repeal the socialist Obamacare law that punishes people who don’t buy a product in a free market, but a few republicans are hesitant to adopt it. Because democrats staunchly defend even the most outrageous atrocities, regardless of which leftist introduced it, they’re working like a pack of wolves to pick off any stragglers and lunge at the throat of anyone who attempts to undo Obamacare. They’re trying to protect one of the single biggest acts of betrayal against American freedom liberal lawmakers have ever banded together to force upon the nation. Cassidy and Graham are trying to get the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill repeal accomplished before budget reconciliation runs out at the end of September. If they can force a vote on the floor without dealing with committees, then the GOP will have one more shot to repeal the disaster of Obamacare before the democrats can filibuster. They’ll need a simple majority. Three of the previous traitors to the last move were John McCain, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski. McCain has expressed some support, but has said that he wants it to go through the committee process, which would stall the measure and democrats time to block it. Collins said she was concerned with the defunding of Planned Parenthood in the bill, but that’s one of the reasons it’s acceptable to many conservatives, for now. Collins told reporters that she’s still looking at the measure, but because it cuts the abortion factory, Planned Parenthood, she is leaning toward traitor-ship yet again. “I’ve got a lot of questions about it,” she said. “And obviously the Planned Parenthood defunding is problematic.” However, Cassidy feels confident. He and Graham are expecting the president to support the effort. One of Cassidy’s aides said that the path to 50 votes isn’t unrealistic, even without Rand Paul’s support. Cassidy has been working hard to bring the measure to a vote before the end of September. After that time, democrats will be able to filibuster any efforts to remove the oppressive law. “I’m hoping that the president will show the same enthusiasm to repeal Obamacare that President Obama showed to pass it,” Graham said last week. The new legislation would change the formula of state paid medical by issuing lump sums in specific amounts based on the state’s actual spending. Democrats are angry that the very fair proposal would make losers of California and other Obamacare worshipers. It basically penalizes states that went whole hog under the socialist Obamacare and expanded their Medicaid. “At some point, you have to ask Massachusetts to control their costs,” Cassidy said. Dissenters also cite the fact that the budget office is predicting dire consequences. However, since Obama lied when he said that premiums would stay the same and that people would be able to keep their own doctors, Cassidy is scoffing at the budget projections that say millions more would go uncovered with the measure. The point here is that healthcare is not a right, despite leftists’ best efforts to push that concept. Cassidy cited the previous incorrect projections the CBO put out concerning Obamacare saying that their “methodology has been proven wrong.” Many people agree with Paul concerning the move. A number of voters want a complete transfer of the healthcare system placed back into the private sector. The measure by Cassidy and Graham would do much to move it back in that direction (and undo one of the legacies left by communist leaning Obama), but it doesn’t accomplish what’s really needed. However, at this point, most conservatives are of the opinion that something is better than nothing. Anything that strips the bloated, wasteful Obamacare system has to be a good thing. Cassidy has also said that he will keep fighting regardless of what happens. “If we don’t get it through now, we’d like to do it in the future,” he said. “But we are thinking we can get this done by Sept. 30.” Hopefully, they will."
"Young Girl Has “Happy And Healthy” Life, 72 Hours Later Doctors Are Baffled",8 SEP 2017,2084,"This is where Kaci needs to be, unfortunately, there is a 6-month waiting list. Kaci Smith has become a mother’s worst nightmare. The 11-year-old went from a normal preteen girl to a bedridden patient who can’t eat, speak, or even go to the bathroom. Possibly the worst part is that doctors are baffled and have absolutely no idea what is wrong with her. Emily Smith, Kaci’s mom believes that she remembers seeing what could have been symptoms of this as far back as October of 2016. Around then, Kaci’s hearing began deteriorating and so did her behavior. However, it wasn’t until February when everything collapsed. The young girl began slurring her speech then. 72 hours later she could not speak at all. She hasn’t said a word since. Her mother states; “Since February she has lost everything. She can’t read, she can’t write, she can’t walk or go to the toilet. She is back in pads. She literally can’t do anything on her own. She can’t use a knife or a fork. She doesn’t eat. She can’t play with anything. If you give her something she gets aggressive. It’s frightening for her and it’s frightening all of us.” Kaci and her mom before the little girl got mysteriously sick. Doctors are unable to discover the cause of all this. Now Kaci needs to go see specialists at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital but the wait list is six months long. Her parents are terrified because they have no idea if she will continue to get worse. “It’s no quality of life for anyone. It’s absolutely heartbreaking. Watching her melt away and missing life, I’m not sure how much more we can take. Everyone is devastated. I have wished so many times that it happened to me instead of her.” The family is trying to raise money to get Kaci private treatment in the hopes of getting a diagnosis more quickly. Mrs. Smith has said “I do accept that we are lucky to have the NHS [public health services] but it seems like it’s taking ages. She is getting worse. Two weeks ago could choose what she wanted and now that has gone. Even if it was something sinister I would rather know.” Source: Daily Mail"
Health Care Company In Hot Water After Customers See What’s Printed On Mail,25 AUG 2017,4400,"Retired Aetna Chairman and C.E.O Ron Williams (left) led the board for many years, but the latest scandal to rock the compnay will be have to be handled by a man with much less experience. The company is accused of revealing its customers’ intimate health data. Insurance giant Aetna is under fire for illegally disclosing sensitive health information. HIV positive customers received letters with their condition visibly printed on the outside of the envelope. The shocking mishap has upset countless people and marred Aetna’s image. The Legal Action Center and the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania have teamed up to seek legal repercussions. A company of Aetna’s size and value should never be commit mistakes of this magnitude. A clear plastic slit on the front of the letter showed not only the recipient’s name and address but a blurb about his or her HIV medications. “This type of mistake is unacceptable,” the company said in a statement. “We sincerely apologize to those affected by a mailing issue that inadvertently exposed the personal health information of some Aetna members… Regardless of how this error occurred, it affects our members and it is our responsibility to do our best to make things right. We will work to ensure that proper safeguards are in place to prevent something similar from happening in the future.” Here you can see the offending enevelope. Anyone who picked up this letter would know that the recipient was being treated for HIV. Aetna officials claim that the letters became dislodged during travel, causing more of its interior to be shown than intended. However, that lessen the grief felt by people who were exposed. Stigmas against HIV are alive and well. The average person still doesn’t know much about the disease “Aetna’s privacy violation devastated people whose neighbors and family learned their intimate health information,” Sally Friedman, legal director of the Legal Action Center, said in astatement. “They also were shocked that their health insurer would utterly disregard their privacy rights.” Your health information doesn’t need to be shared with anyone beyond health care officials. You can disclose an ailment to those around you if you wise, but you certainly don’t have to. A lot of people wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing intimate details with their neighbors, yet it’s not unusual to see a neighbor’s mail. Sometimes there’s a mix-up at the mailbox; sometimes the day’s mail is sitting in plain sight when guests come over. An HIV diagnosis still carries a heavy societal stigma. “We demand that Aetna immediately cease and desist from sending any mail that reveals beneficiaries’ medications or other protected health information to anyone other than the individual who opens the envelope. We also are seeking verification of the corrective measures that Aetna has taken to ensure that Aetna never engages in this type of privacy breach again,” Friedman and Ronda B. Goldfein, executive director of the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, wrote in a letter. Both lawyers admitted that they would likely be suing the company. The mistake with the envelopes was too grievous to be easily forgotten. People with HIV often report feeling alienated when their diagnosis is revealed. “I know of someone who has been kicked out of his home because somebody who saw his envelope learned his HIV status,” said Friedman. “People with HIV need to feel they can seek medical help without their private information being illegally shared with neighbors, family, etc. So when an insurance company breaches confidentiality in this fashion, it can deter people from getting health care.” Aetna has enough money to weather the scandal without going under even if they lose the eventual lawsuit. Still, the company’s reputation may be hard to fix. Americans are intensely private. We care about our civil rights; we don’t our information shared with anyone without our express permission. CNN reports: “Although medical advances have transformed HIV into a chronic yet manageable condition, widespread stigma still exists against people living with HIV, leading to everything from employment, housing and education discrimination to violence. Attorneys said that individuals who contacted them reported that the Aetna letters were seen by family members, roommates and even neighbors who received the mail.” Customers in multiple states were affected."
Congress Approves Funding For Veteran Health Care ‘For Now’,28 JUL 2017,5143,"Days of wrangling over the details resulted in an arrangement both sides can live with. Washington lawmakers showed this week that they can make a deal if they have to, but they’re still grumbling a little bit. The agreement will infuse more cash into the Choice Program, allowing veterans to see a private doctor when VA docs are not available. Days of wrangling over the details resulted in an arrangement both sides can live with and legislators are expected to vote approval before leaving on summer vacation. Without the extension, the program would run out of funds by the middle of August. President Trump promised veterans to get them the care they desperately need but had been denied, under the previous administration’s weak and ineffective leadership. Scandal after scandal rocked the Veterans Administration, showing the Obama appointed officials in charge were totally incompetent. One facility went as far as creating fraudulent documents to cover up waiting lists so long the patients were dying before they got to see a doctor. Backing Trump’s promise, both sides of the aisle came together and created the “Choice Program.” The measure is only temporary until better solutions can be found. So far, it has doubled the number of patients getting access to needed care. President Trump vows to bump that up to triple. Speaking to Veterans in Ohio, Trump promises results will be huge, “We have nearly doubled the number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice. So, not only is it choice, but we’ve doubled up. And now we’re going to be tripling up very shortly.” There was such a backlog and shortage of available professionals within the VA that the money originally allocated has just about dried up. After days of arguing behind the scenes, enough bipartisan support was gathered to inject $2.1 billion to cover the next six months, with another $1.4 billion targeted at improvements within the VA system to hire more staff, lease more space and generally improve facilities. Sponsor of the bill, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, of Georgia, reached out to Democrats and some veteran’s groups who were concerned that there was too much emphasis on outside providers to make sure they were on board. One facility went as far as creating fraudulent documents to cover up waiting lists so long the patients were dying before they got to see a doctor. Republicans and other supporters of the bill say that over privatization is really a non-issue and wasn’t brought up until the last minute. The concerns could have easily been addressed earlier if they had been presented. Arguing over details of “how much to spend, where to spend and how to pay for it,” a deal was eventually struck which appeased groups like Disabled American Veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Vietnam Veterans of America. In a letter signed by the groups, they warned the legislators, “If new funding is directed only or primarily to private sector ‘choice’ care without any adequate investment to modernize V.A., the viability of the entire system will soon be in danger.” VA Director David Shulkin wrote an opinion piece for USA Today earlier this week detailing the proposed “increases to in-house, as well as private care.” Calling the proposal an effort to strengthen the VA’s ability to “provide timely and high quality medical care while improving experiences and outcomes for veterans,” Shulkin points out the best way to do that is with an integration of inside and outside solutions. No single provider can cover all the needed services. By referring patients to outside care providers they can get more specialized care tailored to their individual needs. He also notes the VA budget under President Trump has grown to four times the 2001 level and they are now seeing 3 million more patients inside VA facilities than they were at the height of the crisis under Obama in 2014. Not only is it choice, but we’ve doubled up. And now we’re going to be tripling up very shortly. “Community care or private capacity and VA’s internal capacity are not mutually exclusive. We are ramping up both simultaneously in order to meet the health care needs of the veterans we are charged with serving.” He goes on to say, “VA delivers world class services in polytrauma, spinal cord injury and rehabilitation, prosthetics and orthotics, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress treatments and other behavioral health programs. The department plays a critical role in preparing our nation’s doctors and nurses — 70% of whom train at VA facilities. And we lead the nation in innovation, with VA research having contributed to the first liver transplant, development of the cardiac pacemaker, advancements in treatments for PTSD, cutting-edge prosthetics, and many other medical breakthroughs.” Phillip Carter studies veteran’s issues in a security think tank. “At their core, I think veterans organizations are happy to go on with V.A. Choice as long as it is additive,” he says. “But the minute they sense it will take away from legacy V.A. programs they will oppose it to the death.”"
"Georgia Hospital Holds Couple Against Their Will, Refusing To Accept Their Christian Healthcare",27 JUL 2017,5338,"A Georgia couple was told that they couldn’t leave the hospital until they paid $41,000, despite earlier acceptance of their insurance program. The liberal ideology of socialized medicine has so permeated the healthcare industry that one Georgia couple were held against their will during a cancer treatment. Nick and Laura Alley were detained at the center and told that they couldn’t leave until their medical bill had been paid in cash. The Alleys are part of a Christian-based medical plan that works similar to insurance. The co-op satisfies the ineffective Obamacare law that requires everyone to pay more than their fair share of everyone else’s medical bills. The Medi-Share system works by having members pay monthly premiums, and then the company pays healthcare bills out of the general fund. Although it is not insurance, it uses the insurance network called Private Healthcare Systems to negotiate prices and pay for services. Last year, Medi-Share paid bills for over 200 people. When doctors noticed a lump on Laura’s neck while she was pregnant with their fifth child, the family was devastated. However, the 39-year-old runner didn’t consider the cost of treatment, because she thought she was covered. Northside Hospital told the couple that the previous $98,000 they’d been paid wasn’t correct, and that another cash payment was required before they could leave the facility. “You know, first thing I start to think about is, ‘What am I going do without my wife?’” Laura’s husband, Nick said. The couple made sure that Georgia Cancer Specialists, which is run by Northside Hospital, accepted Medi-Share before Laura began her healing regimen. All went fine for a while, but then one day, the Alleys were treated to a severe case of insurance confusion. While undergoing one chemo session, the couple was told that they wouldn’t be able to leave the hospital until they had paid cash for a bill totaling $41,000. “I’m sitting there, with a needle in my arm, receiving chemotherapy in my arm, and they are telling us that we are not going to be able to leave, until we pay them $41,000,” Laura Alley said. The Alleys have Medi-Share, a Christian co-op type of insurance that shares the burden of each member’s medical bills. A spokesperson from the Northside Hospital told reporters that they have never accepted Medi-Share, but Laura says that’s not true. The couple showed reporters all the previous medical bills, each with a zero balance due. The co-op had paid every charge. The hospital collected over $98,000 for all previous treatments. The spokesperson explained that the hospital has a contract with Private Healthcare Systems (PHCS), but not Medi-Share. They claimed that “Because we thought Mrs. Alley was part of the PHCS plan (PHCS did not tell us otherwise), we billed PHCS for her care. PHCS gave her bills to Medi-Share, who underpaid on our contracted rates with PHCS.” However, the hospital had accepted Alley’s Medi-Share card on at least four separate occasions. Once they realized that Mrs. Alley did “not have insurance,” they acted like some sort of detention police. According to the hospital spokesperson, the Alleys were required to pay back fees because they consider her a “self-pay patient,” unable to receive the negotiation prices the PHCS had established. When confronted with the hospital’s statement, Laura said, “That’s false. It’s about money. But even then, it doesn’t make sense, because they’re getting paid.” The spokesperson also claimed that Medi-Share hadn’t paid the insurance company rates. However, local investigators reviewed each bill and confirmed that the hospital wasn’t telling the truth. Fortunately, Medi-Share is an upright insurance alternative. The co-op wire transferred all the money to pay for Mrs. Alley’s full treatment. Local health insurance broker Beau Miller, with Your Insurance Advocates, also viewed the Alleys’ bills. He explained that Medi-Share did pay the bills like a regular insurance company, but because they aren’t a real insurance company, they have no legal contract with the hospital. However, Medi-Share has a sterling reputation. All of Mrs. Alley’s pregnancy costs were completely covered. The Wellstar North Fulton facility, where she had her baby, told reporters that it considers Medi-Share members in-network patients. To solve Laura’s issue, Medi-Share actually wired the money to the treatment center, and paid for all her medical costs in advance at the self-pay rates. The Alleys were amazed by that, even though they been with the co-op for some time. “They wired the money,” Mr. Alley said. “I mean, wired the money. What kind of health insurance company would do that, you know?” Yesterday, Northside Hospital told reporters, “…the patient has continued her medical treatments with no delays, interruptions or cancellations. Her care has been our top priority from the beginning of her treatment. We consistently worked with the patient on her billing status, and all billing issues have been resolved.” For Americans who don’t want to dump money into giant insurance company pockets, and for those who understand that major insurers typically deny every claim the first time, the Medi-Share behavior is amazing. Fortunately, the couple had an advocate who actually provided the money they needed, right when they needed it."
Senate Majority Leader Takes Repeal Into His Own Hands As GOP Health Bill Flops,18 JUL 2017,4605,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated Tuesday that although he regretted the GOP healthcare bill would not pass, he wanted to do a full repeal of ObamaCare and start over. In a statement delivered on the Senate Floor Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said that in the wake of the dead health care bill, he wants to start over. “I regret that the effort that we repeal and immediately replace Obamacare would not be successful. That doesn’t means we should give up,” McConnell said on the Senate floor, acknowledging defeat but looking forward to his next move in a months-long effort that has stymied the Senate. “This doesn’t have to be the end of the story.” The Senate bill to repeal and replace failed Monday when Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran opposed the bill. “After conferring with trusted experts regarding the latest version of the Consumer Freedom Amendment,”Lee said in a statement, “I have decided I cannot support the current version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act. In addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn’t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations.” McConnell has now proposed a new plan, which would detail a full repeal of ObamaCare, but in a two year transition plan to allow the market to accommodate. In the meantime, he advocates Congress starting from scratch with a bi-partisan bill that is “patient centered.” “We will now try a different way to bring the people relief from Obamacare,” he said. “I think we owe them at least that much. In the coming days, the Senate will take up a vote on a repeal of Obamacare combined with a stable two-year transition period as we work toward patient-centered healthcare.” But, to do this, he needs 50 of the 52 member Republican Congress to support him. Already, two Republicans have objected, and if a third objects, McConnell’s proposal is dead on arrival. “I do not support the new plan,” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a press conference. ”A better approach would be…to begin hearings focused on the problems in the ACA, and let’s try to get bipartisan support to fix those egregious flaws.” Trump however, is in support of the bill, having tweeted, “Republicans should just repeal failing ObamaCare now and work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!” Trump is in total support of the repeal effort, leading Republicans to believe that what the healthcare repeal plan that Obama vetoed in 2015, could now have new life under Trump. McConnell brought up that the same bill was proposed in 2015, and the votes were there, but it died on Obama’s desk. Now, with the support of Trump, Republicans believe they have a shot. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus tweeted, “Time for full repeal of #ObamaCare—let’s put the same thing on President Trump’s desk that we put on President Obama’s desk.” Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Republican Senator Mark Meadows supporting the effort saying that what couldn’t be done in 2015 under Obama, could now be done under Trump. The promise to repeal the controversial Affordable Health Care Act passed in 2010, was what gained Republicans control of Congress in the beginning. Now, with two failed repeal efforts, it is unlikely that they will be able to live up to their promise. According to an Associated Press report, Democrats could “barely contain their glee,” and McConnell urged them to think about what they were celebrating. “The American people are hurting,” he said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) seemed to support the idea of a totally new bipartisan deal when he said, “This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable,” he said. “Rather than repeating the same failed, partisan process yet again, Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long term stability to the markets and improves our health care system.” The White House seems committed to overhauling the system as well, as a tweet from the executive mansion read, “Inaction is not an option. We look forward to Congress continuing to work toward a bill the President can sign to end the Obamacare nightmare and restore quality care at affordable prices.” While variations of repeal and repeal-replace have been discussed endlessly over the last seven years since the bill was passed, the two year transition period seems the most sensible option ever presented."
Number Grows To $1.5M As Refugee Disease Receives Tax-Funded “Public Health Fund”,12 JUL 2017,5384,"Muslim “migrants” are bringing disease epidemics to Minnesota, the Health Commissioner is asking for another $600,000 for the refugee fund. Unlike the bogus liberal reports that say refugees are adding prosperity to America, in reality they are gifting the country with disease, death, and high healthcare expenses. Minnesota is finding out the hard way that the refugee population is costing them dearly. In addition to the millions of dollars that taxpayers are splurging on “migrant” welfare, the secondary costs of the medical care came to $1.5 million in fiscal year 2017. Now, the Minnesota Health commissioner is asking for another $600,000 to cover outbreaks of irradiated diseases among Somali refugees. Drug-resistant tuberculosis and measles spread throughout the population because the migrants come from third-world countries that are already infected. The liberal ideology that wants to force socialized medicine on the American people is gaining ground because of the influx of ill carriers entering the nation. The extra funds are earmarked for controlling the spread of those deadly diseases. Hmong immigrants have previously cost the state over $600,000 in an effort to control tuberculosis, but officials want another $224,000 to help fight the disease this year. Expecting taxpayers to foot the bill for refugees is outrageous. Many of the recipients of free healthcare hate America and want to destroy it. Former Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann weighed in on the controversy. She explained that refugee resettlement is introducing European style healthcare without legislation. Since 1980, over three million invaders have been welcomed and treated in America, without the consent of the communities where they’ve been relocated. The bureaucracy could care less what citizens have to say, all they care about is destroying Western civilization in favor of advancing progressive utopian dreams,” she added. Taxpayers in the state are spending millions of dollars each year on refugee healthcare. Ann Corcoran, an expert on the resettlement efforts, said that the cost of treating the illnesses brought over to the country are never factored in to the studies that say the “refugee influx is helping the community.” She told reporters that healthcare was only a portion of the costs. She considers incarceration and criminal trials another area where taxpayers are being exploited and abused. She mentioned Fazliddin Kurbanov, a refugee in Boise who was convicted of conspiring to recruit Muslim jihadists. He urged refugees to make bombs to destroy U.S. military installations. Other Somali refugees have been convicted of sending money to terrorist organizations overseas. So, basically, Americans pay for the healthcare of these third-world immigrants and then welfare funds and any other money from the nation’s economy is sent out of the country. There’s no way to measure the costs of this kind of economic outflow. The Somali population is particularly infected, and other immigrants are the source of nearly all tuberculosis cases in the state. Amid concerns about the refugee and infections Debra Anderson, chair for the ACT for America chapter in Minnesota, has been working to rectify the situation. She says it’s “not right” that citizens should pay for the forced migration of unvaccinated and diseased immigrants. Neighborhoods are being “fundamentally transformed” she asserts, and the facilitation by faith-based organizations is wrong. Many of the Muslim “refugees” carry more than illnesses, they send money to terrorists organizations and try to recruit more bombers inside the U.S. Anderson has repeatedly requested that the general public be allowed to observe the “Lutheran Social Services” consultation meeting that addresses the “resettlement of refugees” in Minnesota communities. However, the supervisor refused her request. She made another plea to the St. Cloud City Council for information, but has not heard back. The problem with third-world diseases is the fact that they spread, and often the strains are more virulent than what has already been eradicated in the United States. The refuges who come to America with infestations aren’t quarantined from the general population, they’re placed among them. Taxpayers are forced to provide free healthcare to the more then three million migrants who’ve invaded American shores since 1980. Minnesota is discovering that welcome policies have consequences. There have been 78 confirmed cases of the measles since March, and 64 were in the Somali community. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is harder to treat, and health officials are asking for much more money in the new budget, in addition to the funds generally spent. In May, Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger asked the state Legislature for $5 million for an emergency fund to deal with the outbreak of measles, Zika and syphilis. The new requests will add to that. Hopefully, liberals in Minnesota who think money somehow magically appears in the government will wake up to the very real costs of their actions when they are booted from office and replaced with more responsible individuals. Taxpayers can only hope. With an approval, the “Public Health Fund” will increase to over $2 million for 2018. Perhaps the Muslims who benefit will be thankful for the free healthcare and not kill the Americans who’ve given it."
"63,459 People Forced To Leave Democrat Paradise As Health Care System Crashes",1 JUL 2017,6176,"Over 60,000 Canadians fled the country seeking medical attention Canadians are having to flee the country in order to get healthcare. In 2016, the number of people leaving the country in need of treatment skyrocketed an incredible 40%, to well over 60,000 Canadians. All across Canada’s provinces, the number of people leaving is increasing. In fact, only three of the nation’s 10 provinces saw a decrease in the disturbing figure. Many people in need of medical treatment simply grew tired of waiting, and felt forced to finally seek treatment abroad. “Considering Canada’s long health-care wait times, which can result in increased suffering for patients and decreased quality of life, it’s not surprising that so many Canadians are travelling abroad for medical treatment,” said Yanick Labrie, Fraser Institute senior fellow and co-author of the study. The average Canadian is currently having to wait an average of 10.6 weeks to see a specialist. That is a month longer than what physicians deem reasonable. Canada’s wait times are a month longer than what physicians deem reasonable. According to the studies estimates, Canadians are not traveling thousands of miles to see specialists either. The Frasier study estimates Canadian patients (9,454) traveled abroad for general surgeries, more than any other treatment. This fact even made it into the presidential last year when, at the time, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump brought up health care during a debate. Trump called the Canadian health care system “slow” and “catastrophic,” going on to say that “when [Canadians] need a big operation […] they come into the United States.” The facts show that the future presidential winner was correct. This exodus of Canadians seeking treatment because they are unable to see someone in their city, or even their country, flies in the face of the healthy dose of praise heaped on America’s northern neighbor by liberals. Democrat politicians and liberal voters often cite Canada, Sweden and the UK as proof that socialized medicine can work. What is not mentioned is that these populations are much smaller, and less diverse, than America’s. The combined population of the United Kingdom (69.5 million), Canada (33 million) and Sweden (9.8 million) is barely more than one-third (33%) the size of America (321.4 million). For perspective, Sweden, the homogeneous Nordic nation that liberals often rave about when the subject of socialized health care is broached, has the population of Georgia, Michigan or North Carolina. America is 33 times larger. Canada, another example of a working single payer system for the left, is about 10% smaller than California, in terms of population. Imagine if Californians were having to flee to Nevada, Oregon, or further, for general surgeries. Yet recently, California decided to emulate the Canadians by passing their own single-payer health care bill. There was just one problem: money. California State Sen. Ricardo Lara, who is taking the lead of bringing single-payer to California The $400 billion single-payer bill passed California’s Senate, 23-14. It now will be advanced to the Assembly, where they will work to find ways to include the taxes necessary to pay for this state handout. When analysis of the bill was released estimates were that the state would have to raise $200 billion each year to pay for it. The solution proposed was more state taxes, this time in the form of a 15% percent payroll tax. That is simply a job killer, and will force more jobs to flee the state. So as Obamacare has driven premiums up, financially ruined some families, cost millions of other Americans to lose their doctors and stifled job creators, Democrats are pushing for an expansion upon this system that is not working for many Americans. California Senator Nancy Skinner. California’s only idea to pay for their single-payer dreams is more taxes. Mrs. Stephanie Woolhandler, co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program believes that in the long run, things will be better. “Government spending on health programs would initially rise, but it would later be offset by a reduction in premiums and out-of-pocket costs”. There were not many details given to back that assertion, but she goes on to claim that “What we have now is not a solution. We still have people dying. We still have people not getting care.” Again, there was no fact backing up this claim. One advocate, Kitty Kennedy, of the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans, suggested that allowing safe importation of drugs from abroad could make it easier for Americans to afford prescription drugs. This is a popular idea among voters on both sides because it introduces free markets, which conservatives love, and lower prices, which both sides are demanding. California once again has taken the lead on becoming a socialist utopia. By being the first state to pass a single-payer system, even though it cannot fund it, and with New York working on its own single-payer system and Coloradans set to vote on such a ballot initiative in November, the left is trying to advance this single-payer medicine ball state by state. But will single-payer ever really come to America? We’ve seen the Democrat base move the party very left in rapid order, but Democrat leaders are skeptical that the nation is ready to go this far left. During the election, Hillary Clinton said it was not feasible, Obama stated it would have to be done incrementally and even uber liberal San Francisco Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, flatly said “No.” when asked about running on socializing medicine in the next election cycle. Avik Roy, who has advised Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates on health policy states “The real obstacle to a true single-payer system in America is not politics, in the sense of voters, Republicans blocking such a bill. It’s doctors and hospitals who would stand to be paid a lot less money”. As it stands, the Democrat base want less free markets and more universal healthcare. There is no guarantee that that will solve anything, but it does guarantee that taxes will go up. That does not sound like a good deal for America and Americans."
"Illegal Profession Makes A Stand, Demand Taxpayers Shell Out For Their Healthcare",30 JUN 2017,5347,"Prostitutes dive into lobby efforts to fight for women’s rights. Lobbyists to save Obamacare have gained a whole new group of supporters. These supporters are not the average ones fighting on the hill, but instead an odd mix of sex workers demanding to keep free health care for them and their families. While the group of prostitutes that call themselves “Hookers for Healthcare” work in legal brothels in the state of Nevada, they also represent illegal sex workers from all over. It seems that this group benefited hugely from Obamacare, and now they are simply not interested in paying for their coverage. At the front of this unlikely group of politicians is a self-proclaimed hooker named Alice Little. She works at Dennis Hof’s Sagebrush Brothel. They are located outside of Carson City. Little has shared that Obamacare was the first time many prostitutes, both legal and not, had healthcare. In her industry, she fears changes in healthcare means a lack of access to services key to working girls like those related to pregnancy, eating disorders and sexual health. As Little explained, “…thousands of prostitutes nationwide were, for the first time, able to obtain affordable health care insurance for themselves and their families.” Brothel workers and prostitutes nationwide fight for health insurance. Any changes to Obamacare are worth fighting in the eyes of “Hookers for Healthcare.” The group is promising to take the fight head on as they go on “…on a political offensive … lobbying politicians, protesting in the streets, and waging battle on social media to stop the Republican effort.” It seems that the working women of the brothel see the problem with repealing Obamacare tied to the men behind the battle not understanding the unique health needs of women. These sex workers are taking a united stand on behalf of all women, as they explain: “When I look at the folks that are making decisions, the majority of them are male voices. They have no idea how they’re affecting women’s lives. These ladies are often stereotyped and I want to bring some humanity to their stories. We are people. We have families. We have the same health concerns as other Americans.” After Little explains the group’s stance on health reform, she also told a bit about the plight of prostitutes nationwide. It seems many of the workers truly need access to free medical insurance as they work as independent contractors. They are not provided employer funded health coverage. According to Little: “As independent contractors, prostitutes are at the mercy of the health care marketplace to obtain our own insurance and are often reliant on Medicaid. I have been fortunate to amass a strong clientele and establish myself as a financially successful businesswoman within Nevada’s legal brothel industry, but that can take time.” During all of this discussion about the ladies plight to access insurance, one key person is not buying that they are dependent on Obamacare. That is the owner of the brothel, Dennis Hof. He shared that many of the ladies do well enough to pay for coverage, including Little who made about $500,000 last year. In Hof’s opinion: “I believe in people taking responsibility for their own lives, and not asking for these kind of government handouts. You start giving these working girls free or discounted health care coverage, then what comes next? … This is definitely not a road we want to go down.” While Little wants us to think that her $500,000 a year salary leaves her needing Obamacare, there are also others that she fears will lose coverage. It seems the ladies of the seven brothels that Hof owns see many clients who are over the age of 65. That to Obamacare could mean these customers are no longer able to fund the work of the brothels. As Little explains: “Under Trumpcare insurers will be able to charge older consumers five times more than young consumers. People over the age of 65 make up a very large percentage of Nevada brothel clients. If these clients are forced to pay unfairly augmented health care costs, they will not have money on hand to spend on the things that make life worth living in the first place — like sex.” The ladies of Nevada are back in the political business. In this case, the legal prostitutes are not only protecting their access to healthcare, but also their customer’s ability to still pay for sex. This seems like a pretty big leap to fight to keep Obamacare. In an interesting twist, this is not the first time many of the 100 workers from Nevada have joined to support a political agenda. Before “Hookers for Healthcare” many of them participated in “Hookers For Hillary.” Even brothel owner Dennis Hof is not buying the idea that the working girls depend on Obamacare. Although Hof does not support the cause of his ladies, he did share that this particular group is strong willed and ready to take a stand. According to Hof: “These aren’t your daddy’s old hookers. These aren’t street walkers. They’re professional working girls that work in a legal environment. In fact, half of them have college educations, 20% have master’s degrees, a few have doctorate degrees and one, an Ivy League educated professor, picks up hours to help pay off her huge student loans. I love that they’re involved. These girls are smart, they will be running our country, and they vote.”"
"Portion Of Healthcare Reform Passed, Liberals Speechless At What It Does",15 JUN 2017,4742,"The House of Representatives passed Lou Barletta’s bill to prohibit illegal residents from receiving tax credits for health insurance premiums. The socialized healthcare debate has been going on for over a decade. The issue of illegal immigration is another hotly contested topic between conservatives and Democrats. Liberals think that the U.S. should allow lawbreakers to prosper here without conforming to federal statutes. They also believe that taxpayer money can somehow magically provide for everyone’s ills. However, that view is not compatible with the majority of Americans. The election last November made that very clear. In a move that corresponds to the desires of U.S. citizens, the House has passed legislation to ensure that illegal inhabitants can’t access tax credits for health insurance premiums. The measure passed on Tuesday will require that people who apply for tax credits be verified as citizens or legal residents by the Treasury Department. The party-line vote was approved 238 to 184. Federal law already demands proof of legal status to enroll in an exchange program and receive “premium assistance credits.” However, verification was performed by the Department of Health and Human Services, which means it wasn’t executed. The representative from Pennsylvania drafted a bill to ensure that legal status was obtained before assistance credits were distributed to immigrants. As it is now, if a person’s legal standing can’t be confirmed, they receive temporary coverage. The new legislation was introduced by Rep. Lou Barletta. The Verify First Act, was created in response to a meeting he had with President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. He explained that there was no way he’d vote for the proposed American Health Care Act without some provision to deny illegal residents taxpayer benefits. Barletta argued that it was “outrageous” that “half a million illegal immigrants received three-quarters of a billion dollars in Obamacare payments, while American workers and families were priced out of their healthcare plans” because of skyrocketing premiums. The new bill requires that social security numbers be substantiated by both the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security before any premium tax credits are released. The new legislation will ensure that all beneficiaries of tax credits have their citizenship or legal status verified before getting tax payer funds. Last year Barletta was adamant in his questions to former Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Matthews Burwell about the Obama administration’s practice of payments to illegals. According to statistics, the healthcare costs for criminal residents in the country amount to nearly $11 billion every year. That amount includes “anchor babies,” which are children born in hospitals at taxpayer expense to illegal parents in the U.S. Each instance costs approximately $10,000, which is typically paid through Medicaid. The new numbers confirm the expanding costs of illegal healthcare, which was discovered by research conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies in 2004. When Obamacare was forced on American citizens by activist lawmakers, Democrats assured the public that illegals wouldn’t be included in the new socialist provision. That, however, was untrue. Barletta argued the fact that $75 million each year has been squandered on criminal residents’ under Obamacare. Since its implementation, over $750 million dollars has been spent each year to pay for medical treatments for non-citizens. Barletta’s bill will halt that waste. During the debate, he explained that the measure would ensure that tax credits wouldn’t be squandered on individuals who aren’t telling the truth about their legal status. Of course, Democrat opponents offered their typical illogical arguments. They said that the new bill would make it more difficult for some people to obtain credits, especially those who can’t easily verify their status. Rep. Judy Chu from California said that the “bill seeks to address a problem that does not exist.” Perhaps she doesn’t have time to educate herself on illegal resident healthcare costs. Liberals also complained that the measure unfairly targeted “undocumented immigrants.” At least they understand the purpose of the measure. The vote yesterday is the first of four bills that House will be considering this week. Although the main healthcare repeal legislation was passed in March, this “third phase” involves policy changes not addressed in the major package. There have been some snags along the way, but reform of socialized healthcare is happening. By denying tax credits to illegal residents, the Verify First Act will save the country billions of dollars."
Flint Crisis Reaches New Heights After Health Official Charged With Manslaughter Following Deaths,14 JUN 2017,5863,"Nick Lyon, the head of the Michigan Health and Human Services, is charged with manslaughter in connection with the Flint water crisis. When researchers tried to get to the bottom of the problem to prevent resident death, he blocked their way, allegedly saying, “They have to die of something. “ The Flint water crisis just got a whole new chapter. Five public officials, including the head of the Michigan health department, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter over the death of an 85-year-old man. The charges stem from 2014 when public officials tried to save money by switching the city’s water supply to Flint River. The river wasn’t properly treated to reduce the risk of corrosion. The lead from old pipes leaked into the river and subsequently the water system. Over the next year, over 100 people contracted Legionnaires diseases and twelve of those resulted in death. Legionnaire’s is a pneumonia-type disease that comes from contaminated water. The bacteria breeds in fresh water. If the water is warmed, such as being filtered into a hot water heater, or used in the heated compression chambers of air cooling units, the bacteria thrive and spread. The disease itself is noncontagious but it is typically spread when people breathe in the contaminated particles disseminated through the dirty water’s mist. Symptoms typically manifest within two to ten days after exposure. There is no vaccine and the disease is typically treated with antibiotics. But, people that have a history of smoking, a weakened immune system, or other respiratory problems are at a greater risk. In those cases, particularly among the elderly, Legionnaire’s can be fatal. When Legionnaire’s starting breaking out in Flint in 2014, Nick Lyons, head of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, failed to alert the public of the concern. Attorney General Bill Schuette began a criminal investigation thereafter. Areas of concern include the causes of the lead poisoning and who was responsible for not preventing it. Others parts of the investigation have to deal with the spread of Legionnaire’s and who did or didn’t act quickly enough. Lyons insists that the Legionnaire’s outbreak actually came from McLaren hospital where most of the cases were being treated. Although prosecutors say less than half of the cases were treated there. Attorney General Bill Schuette expressed disgust at the “arrogance that would want to sweep this under the rug.” He insists that the fact the crisis exploded is proof that system ultimately works. Schuette has called for heads to roll in a probe being called the largest investigation in Michigan history. So far it has included more than 250 interviews and e-mails numbering into six digits. “The health crisis in Flint has created a trust crisis for Michigan government, exposing a serious lack of confidence in leaders who accept responsibility and solve problems,” Schuette said.  To date, 13 government officials are facing charges ranging from willful neglect of duty, misconduct, and conspiracy. However, Wendesday’s manslaughter charge is a new one. Lyon has been charged, along with five other officials, for involuntary manslaughter connected to the December 2015 death of 85-year-old Robert Skidmore. Lyon was also charged with misconduct in office. At one point, Governor Rick Snyder asked researchers at Wayne State University to research the outbreak and whether the cases were linked to the water supply. Lyon blocked the order saying the state couldn’t afford to do the research, even though a doctor insisted that people could die. His response was that he “couldn’t save everyone,” and then added, “they have to die of something.” Lyon’s charges could send him to prison for up to 15 years. In a press conference, Schutte credited the legal system for bringing justice in the end. “That arrogance that people would want to sweep this away and that there are nameless, faceless bureaucrats who caused this and no one responsible is outrageous,” he said. The decision to switch the city’s water supply to Flint River was supposedly done to save money. But officials never treated the water properly, manipulated water samples, and lied on bond applications to get it all done. Last week Dr. Eden Wells, the chief medical officer for the state, was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to an investigator. Wells’ attorney insists that the charges are false. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, to whom both Lyon and Wells’s reported to, stands behind the disgraced officials. He said that they would keep their jobs and that they had his “full faith and confidence.” Although, many Flint residents want to throw him under the bus as well. Schuette does not currently have enough evidence for an arrest at this time and told Flint residents that he has not been cooperative in their investigation. “We attempted to interview the governor,” Schuette said. “We were not successful.” Other heads on the legal chopping block include Flint’s former emergency manager, Darnell Earley, Flint’s former emergency manager, and Howard Croft the former director of public works. They both allegedly lied on a bond application to get the water switched in the first place. Stephen Busch, an environmental regulator, was charged with misconduct, tampering, and violating the Safe Water Drinking Act after he ordered an official to falsify the water samples. Liane Shekter Smith is another environmental regulator whose reported crimes weren’t direct but her inactivity on the issue amounted to misconduct and willful neglect. All are being implicated for involuntary manslaughter. The Flint water crisis continues to grow, like “a long novel,” one resident said. But with the manslaughter charges, this isn’t going to be solved quickly or neatly. However, the residents who have suffered so much deserve justice."
Liberal Narrative Crushed As World Health Organization Releases The Numbers,6 JUN 2017,5258,"The World Health Organization released a report stating that the United States was one of the least offending when it comes to air pollution on the planet. This is contrary to media reports while tend to shame Americans for their “privileged and pollutant lifestyles. Amidst Trump’s pullout of the Paris Accord and the resulting liberal outcry, the World Health Organization just released a refreshing new report. Much of the organization’s numbers conflict with the liberal narrative and paint the United States as being much more environmentally friendly than the media reports claim. The exhaustive report named every country in the world and ranked their air pollutant status, both in raw data and in comparison to other countries around the globe. According to the report, the United States had some of the cleanest air in the world. We surpassed most of Europe, including France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. We also outranked Japan in air quality level. In fact, the only G7 country that surpassed the United States in terms of clean air was Canada. This could be due to a less concentrated human population. The numbers were measured by taking the mean annual concentration of suspended particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These fine particles are mainly what causes pollutant-related diseases. The organization believes these lead to chronic diseases like acute lower respiratory infection, chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. The United States had a ranking of 8, with France coming in at 13, while China had a 59, and India had 66, while Egypt had a whopping 101. The ranking bottomed out with the Middle Eastern oil countries. Saudi Arabia was the worst offender— with air pollution at 127. In another report by WHO, they ranked the 15 worst cities for air quality. Despite the liberal rhetoric, no American city was listed at all. In comparison, China had 3 cities on the list as did Saudi Arabia. India had seven cities. In two separate rankings, the tourist haven Honolulu, Hawaii has been named as one of the cleanest cities in the world. In another study conducted by the Blacksmith Institute and Green Cross Switzerland, they compiled the ten most polluted cities in the world versus the top ten cleanest cities. The worst cities list was again full with Russia, India, and China, each having multiple cities on the list. However, there was not a single American city represented. However, the cleanest list had two U.S. cities—Honolulu coming in second and Minneapolis near the middle. Further, while it doesn’t have the same authority as the World Health Organization, a travel magazine recently analyzed metadata to compile the Cleanest Cities in the World. The United States was the only country to have three cities on the list—Chicago at 2, Honolulu at 4, and Portland, Oregon in sixteenth place. Russia, China, and India had no cities on the list. Now, the defense for media reports stating otherwise is that the methodology for measuring pollution is different. While the WHO is testing for disease-causing chemicals in the air, new methodologies have tested for pollution by measuring who puts the most carbon dioxide in the air. But, according to reports, carbon dioxide is harmless. It is odorless, colorless, and gives life to plants. Humans do inhale it, and naturally, filter it out. Greenhouses actually have CO2 pumped into the air to help the plants grow bigger, better, and faster. Breitbart states that the current average for CO2 in the air is around 400 ppm. But, there have been times in our planet’s history, that, without human intervention, the CO2 levels have risen as high as 7,000 ppm.   Renowned United Nations scientist Dr. Indur Goklany recently authored a paper for the UN stating that carbon dioxide was harmless and actually beneficial for the planet. In fact, Dr. Indur Goklany, a UN climate change expert, authored a paper for the Global Warming Policy Foundation stating that carbon dioxide levels are actually good for “both humanity and the biosphere, generally.” “Carbon dioxide fertilises plants, and emissions from fossil fuels have already had a hugely beneficial effect on crops, increasing yields by at least 10-15 percent,” Dr. Golkany argues. “This has not only been good for humankind but for the natural world too, because an acre of land that is not used for crops is an acre of land that is left for nature.” In the forward of the report, Professor Freeman Dyson, who is a world-renowned scientist, wrote that Golkanky’s findings reveal “how a whole generation of scientific experts is blind to obvious facts.” He also said that, “the thinking of politicians and scientists about controversial issues today is still tribal.” While the United States may be among the chief of sinners in regard to carbon dioxide emissions, if the science holds up, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. But, among pollutants in the air, it appears our country is among the saints of the world. Perhaps an environmental policy aimed at reducing pollutants should focus less on the United States and more on the Middle Eastern and developing countries. China, India, Russia, as well as Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries were really the highest offenders."
"$201M Squandered On Luxurious Travel, Associated Press Exposes Health Organization Racket",23 MAY 2017,4499,"WHO spent over $200 million on travel in 2016. On the World Health Organization’s website, their mission statement is as follows: “Our goal is to build a better, healthier future for people all over the world. Working in offices in more than 150 countries, WHO staff work side by side with governments and other partners to ensure the highest attainable level of health for all people.” In a new report, it was discovered that WHO actually spends more on travel expenses than they do on fighting some of the world’s deadliest diseases. In a report by the Associated Press, after spending time in Guinea to celebrate the creation of the first Ebola vaccine, Director General of WHO Margaret Chan retreated to the Palm Camayenne Hotel. Not only did she choose a five-star hotel, she also chose to stay in the $1,000-dollar-a-night presidential suite complete with Marble flooring, a large dining room, and countless other luxurious amenities. The Palm Camayenne Hotel was Guinea’s first five-star hotel. According to internal documents, WHO spends over $200 million on travel expenses every year. This is more than the organization spends on fighting AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. This absurd figure has incited ire from all corners of the political spectrum. Surely those helping fight diseases such as AIDS or Ebola must travel and have a place to sleep, but does that place need to be the most expensive room in the hotel? Hardly. Last year, the organization spent nearly $71 million on AIDS and hepatitis. It dedicated $61 million to fighting malaria and spent $59 million in their fight to stop the spread of tuberculosis. WHO does have detailed regulations when it comes to travel, however, these regulations are often manipulated to allow for more luxurious accommodations. The agency explains that it’s difficult to keep tabs on the specific travel arrangements made by all on its payroll. Despite this clear breaching of regulations, officials say the organization does very little to combat the problem. The issue of excessive travel spending has been addressed by officials in the organization as WHO continues to ask for funding. Officials complain about the breaking of rules put in place to limit spending on travel. An internal memo was even sent out about the subject. “As an organization, we must demonstrate that we are serious about managing this appropriately,” the memo read. Over $400,000 was spent by Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO director of outbreak response,  on travel during the Ebola crisis. According to reports filed by Aylward, he often opted for costly helicopter flights instead of jeep rides. Some anonymous sources told the Associated Press that Chan often flew in first class. Such extravagance is comparable to the televangelist who collects millions in offering and proceeds to spend it on private jets and island mansions. In a time when WHO claims to be in need of cash to fight devastating diseases, it is imperative the organization be transparent and responsible when it comes to travel expenses. The United States is the biggest funder of WHO within the United Nations, meaning these lavish travel expenses do in fact fall back on the American taxpayer. While many Americans see the merit in their tax dollars helping to end deadly diseases, it is doubtful they imagined those dollars being spent on first-class plane tickets. WHO defended this travel expenditure saying a majority of the costs were spent on “sending outside experts to countries and for representatives from member countries to attend their meetings,” according to a press release. However, the organization has taken flak from all sides for focusing so much of their cash on travel, rather than using it to help the third-world countries that suffer the most from these infectious diseases. Similar organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and the Center For Disease Control have very strict rules regarding travel to avoid just such a controversy. DWB bans all staff from flying business class including the organization’s president. They must instead fly coach, without exception. CDC staff is only permitted to fly business class in medical emergencies. WHO would be wise to follow the examples of these other organizations and put in place much more explicit and strictly enforced rules if they expect to continue receiving funding from the UN. They must prove that their number one priority is fighting diseases and not the excessive comfort of their staff and colleagues."
800% Increase Causes World Health Organization To Sound Alarm: Ebola Outbreak Among Refugees,22 MAY 2017,5622,"W.H.O. prepares to fight to 800 percent growth in the last week of Ebola cases. Ebola is a word the brings terror and mass confusion to mind. An outbreak of any type could be devastating, and for the most part, many assume we have seen the last of the disease with the end of the 2014 outbreak. This is not the case as suddenly it is resurfacing in refugee populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This most recent outbreak started on April 22 and has grown 800 percent since then. The current outbreak is still in the early stages. The total number of cases jumped from nine to 29 in seven days. As relief workers found out during the 2014 outbreak, it only takes one patient traveling outside of the exposure zone to start a widespread, multi-national outbreak. There have already been approximately 400 people exposed to the virus from these 29 cases alone. An outbreak of Ebola can spread quickly with as much as one single traveler making it beyond the containment zone. On April 22, the recent outbreak came to the attention of the World Health Organization as a man being transported to the hospital with a suspected case died. According to a recent report: “The outbreak was reported in a densely forested part of Bas-Uele Province, near the border with the Central African Republic. Cases have occurred in four separate parts of a region called the Likati health zone. Aid groups and the W.H.O. have struggled to reach the affected area, which has no paved roads. The first known case occurred on April 22, when a 39-year-old man who had fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding died on the way to a hospital in the Likati zone. The person caring for him and a motorcyclist who transported him also died. The first six months of the response to the outbreak are expected to cost the W.H.O. and aid groups $10 million. Telecommunications networks would have to be established and airstrips repaired so that aid workers can provide the necessary medical care.” While the current outbreak is concentrated in a remote part of Africa, it is not enough to assume the remote location works as an advantage. The W.H.O. workers have had a tough time even getting to treatment sites so at this time is in not clear if the 400 people they know have come into contact with Ebola are the only ones. There may be others who have continued to travel in the area. Many Africans are making their way to Europe amidst the migrant crisis. It could only be a matter of time before it spreads in that manner. The outbreak in 2014 began in this same manner, in a remote part of Africa. According to a recent report: “With international travel via airports, trains and cars available throughout the region, a single infected individual on an airplane could infect scores of others, who in turn could infect scores more.” In an attempt to slow down the current growth of the breakout, emergency workers are moving into the area to focus on the 400 exposures. These efforts will include setting up isolation units to limit those people from passing it on to others. 400 exposures may not seem like that big of a number, but remember it only takes one person traveling outside of the immediate area to turn this number into thousands. The video below explains how Ebola can suddenly move beyond the local area to a worldwide issue. It does not take much for this to happen. With refugees streaming out of Africa, this scenario is not outrageous. Because the area is so remote, health care workers are being flown in via helicopters. Relief agencies are also quickly attempting to improve airstrips and telecommunication lines in the area. This will help to support bringing in more workers, equipment, and communications with global teams. Officials struggle to set up treatment centers due to the remote location. It is not known yet if the current outbreak is a similar strain to the one we saw in 2014. That strain has been particularly troubling as officials realized: “…the 2014 strain began hyper-evolving, to the point that had it not been contained and continued to spread through human contact, it could have gone airborne, making it as easy to catch as a common cold. In response to this unprecedented threat, US government officials began preparing for mass casualties, reportedly going so far as to develop plans for Community Care Centers where infected individuals, or those suspected of infections, would be detained indefinitely. As the Ebola contagion spread across the globe, the panicked populace rushed to stockpile emergency supplies like freeze dried foods, bio-protective body suits and gas masks. The concern, of course, was that a virus with a 90% fatality rate after infection would make its way to local American communities. As Tess Pennington notes in her Pandemic Preparedness Guide, once it’s within 50 miles of where you live, it’s time to worry and take immediate steps to isolate your family from the threat, because most people won’t realize how serious of a situation they are in.” Within the public health community, there has been lots of talk about the shortcomings of the W.H.O. response to the 2014 outbreak. It is scary to think that this time around something similar may unfold naturally due to limited access to the area. The virus is growing very quickly as workers struggle to arrive on site. The biggest difference between 2014 and now is the fact that the W.H.O. is at least attempting to get on the ground this time. Their efforts have been slower than they would like but the attempt is there. Let’s hope this is not the type of evolving strain that could at some point go airborne."
"$700M Hemorrhaging Loss, ObamaCare Aftermath Driving Aetna Healthcare Out Of Marketplace",11 MAY 2017,5447,"  Aetna is the latest in a string of insurance companies to leave the state exchanges. Major health insurance provider Aetna announced Wednesday that they will be completely pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplace exchange program beginning in 2018. The healthcare insurance provider has suffered a loss of at least $700 million in the last two years and financial predictions for 2017 include a $200 million loss so far. Tom Price, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, attributes this as a sign of the marketplace instability caused by ObamaCare. “Aetna’s decision to completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges adds to the mountain of evidence that ObamaCare has failed the American people. Repealing and replacing it with patient-centered solutions that stabilize the marketplace to bring down costs and increase choices is the only solution,” Price said. Aetna’s exit has been a gradual one. In 2016, they said they would limit their marketplace coverage to only 15 states. At the beginning of 2017, claiming financial losses, they cut their offerings back to only four states—Virginia, Iowa, Delaware, and Nebraska. Last month the company announced it would no longer provide marketplace coverage in Virginia for 2018. Early in May, they declared they would not be participating in the state exchanges in Iowa either. Now, this new initiative cuts back on their involvement in Delaware and Nebraska leaving them completely out of the exchange program. “Our individual commercial products lost nearly $700 million between 2014 and 2016, and are projected to lose more than $200 million in 2017 despite a significant reduction in membership. Those losses are the result of marketplace structural issues that have led to co-op failures and carrier exits, and subsequent risk pool deterioration,” the company said Wednesday. It’s the latest in the string of insurers to exit the marketplace. Insurance companies are not faring well under ObamaCare. “The insurance companies are fleeing. It’s been a catastrophe … It’s essentially dead. If we don’t pay lots of ransom money over to the insurance companies, it would die immediately,” President Trump said last week on the passage of the American Health Care Act. When Aetna pulled out of Iowa earlier this month, Medica was also threatening to leave the state. “Without swift action by the state or Congress to provide stability to Iowa’s individual insurance market, Medica will not be able to serve the citizens of Iowa in the manner and breadth that we do today. We are examining the potential of limited offerings, but our ability to stay in the Iowa insurance market in any capacity is in question at this point,” the company said in a statement. There were only three main insurance companies in the Iowa marketplace. The third is Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield. With those two companies pulling out, BCBS will be only insurance provider for Iowans. CNN Money reported that even they will be pulling out in 2018 as well. And Iowa isn’t alone either, Fox News reports. For 2018, five states will only have one provider available through the healthcare marketplace. Those states are Alaska, Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming. Fox News reports that the one provider option affects 32% of the counties nationwide. Molina Healthcare, one of the top insurers under ObamaCare, announced it would be leaving the exchange program if Congress didn’t pass legislation allowing insurers to be reimbursed for providing care to low-income patients. Humana has already completely pulled out of the individual market 2018 and other companies are pulling out as well. The ones that remain are announcing huge rate spikes. The reasons are simple–patients are running up high bills and the premiums can’t cover it. With more people being insured than ever and the ban of discriminating against pre-existing conditions, it’s a losing game economically.  Also, they cite, the political instability of healthcare coverage coming out of Washington creates instability in the market. Insurers are concerned about the regulations and cost increases they will face. It’s better to get out of the game altogether. A repeal and replace plan to ObamaCare passed the House last Thursday in a narrow 213-217 vote. Not a single Democrat voted for the bill. The American Health Care Act overrides a lot of the financial burden that ObamaCare contained, including slashing funding for Medicaid expansion and penalties for not buying healthcare. It also allows states to opt out of the pre-existing conditions clause. But even the American Health Care Act needs improvement. The American Medical Association said it would still be ineffective. The American Healthcare Act passed the House of Representatives last Thursday, by a narrow partisan margin. It now rests with the Senate for debate and amendments. “The bill passed by the House today will result in millions of Americans losing access to quality, affordable health insurance and those with pre-existing health conditions face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question,” AMA president Andrew W. Gurman said. The bill now rests with the Senate and is likely to undergo long debate and amendment. But, House Speaker Paul Ryan is optimistic that the bill will pass “in a month or two.” That is if there are any insurance companies left to work with."
"After Failure With Health Care Paul Ryan Releases More Bad News, This Time It’s Something Else",6 APR 2017,7120,"Paul Ryan seems to just keep the bad news coming. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), a RINO (Republican In Name Only), was nearly one heartbeat away from being the President of the United States, which is a truly sobering thought. Had Mitt Romney won the 2012 election, the Vice President of the U.S.A. would have been Ryan. He is the gentleman who just informed the nation that tax reform could take longer to arrive for Americans than the new healthcare bill. This is refreshing news in the sense that America is less likely to get a really rotten deal, something common from both sides of the aisle. It is awful when one considers that taxes are not nearly as complex as healthcare, however. That is, unless you are the federal government. Those like Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) have been saying for a very long time that taxes should be able to be done on the back of an index card. Others have suggested adding a one or two cent tax on EVERYTHING and locking in that rate for seven to ten years. That would cover not only taxes, but healthcare too. Some even suggest abolishing the I.R.S. altogether, an idea that, in many ways, compliments the Constitution and reigns in government spending. The I.R.S. was supposed to be temporary, according to many who spoke in support of its implementation at the time. Uncle Sam has a nasty habit of breaking promises like that even to this day. How long will American’s need to wait for tax reform? Ryan (pictured) seems to think that it could take awhile. “The House has a (tax reform) plan but the Senate doesn’t quite have one yet. They’re working on one. The White House hasn’t nailed it down,” Ryan said. He added, “So even the three entities aren’t on the same page yet on tax reform.” Now while the White House can be forgiven for being slow to embrace anything that comes out of Washington with any haste or trust, Congress itself should certainly not be taking this long. How long have the GOP had to craft something fair and workable that does not take multiple reams of paper to print? If the government must insist on the “right” of taking money from the people, the text to do so does not need to be 74,608 pages long. The whole mess began when certain perks were created that treated the very wealthy and the very poor much better than everyone else. Soon the very poor were even getting I.R.S. checks, even if they did not work or were disabled. While helping those in need is justified on a state level, our federal government often gives tax return payments to those who do not pay taxes. This has nothing whatsoever to do with tax collection, and yet, it is part of our tax code. Former Presidential Candidate, Rand Paul (pictured), has an idea what to do with today’s tax code. For the very rich, things get even worse! In many instances, two very odd things are working in tandem within our code regarding the upper brackets. To begin with, the rich are over taxed and the “mega-rich” in some instances are not. Those that are overtaxed are seeing amounts of more than 25% of their profits eaten in taxes, which is a federal overreach no matter how much money they have. This creates a need for this bracket’s lobbies and “special interest” groups to loom like specters around politicians and in various ways offer them money to help. These groups can not outright PAY the politicians, so there has to be legal ways birthed that allow this. These “new ways” ALSO get put into our tax code. Once the poor, the rich, the lobbyists/groups, and the moneychangers have altered the code, then every politician in every state decides that the tax code can be tweaked to help meet a need that they have. Somehow this becomes acceptable for a tax code change (though it has NOTHING to do with tax collection either). With 50 states full of reaching politicians, several thousand MORE pages get added. All of this is just a small listing of the common misdeeds that corrupt our tax code. There are nuances, certain “breaks” for people/occupations, paid expenses, etc. that get much more detailed and yawn inducing. The facts show that IRS has become a monster that is out of control in terms of size, scope and collection. The “loopholes” that we hear so very much about are created when something on page 600 conflicts with something else on page 5,699, for instance. There may be even more than two conflicts in such a massive set of rules. Those who can afford to spend six months doing taxes can play these loopholes against one another and legally choose which one gets them the most money. As the tax monster grows, so do the loopholes. If this has made one’s head spin to absorb, just imagine how much bigger and more hideous it will be next year, or in ten years. If something is not done about this with greater haste, it won’t get done at all. That, at least, is the fear that many have because that is the history of Washington. Bush was not that different than Obama, just look at the examples of Saddam Hussien and Muammar Gaddaffi. Trump is wise to not have just any status quo pleasing tax code tossed out in order to keep everyone placated. That is called prudence. He was elected for such careful deal making. Still, if reform takes too much time, more members of Congress will want to add their own exceptions to any changes. If Democrats stall this or try to tax us even higher so they can spend more, reform will get muddled in political wrangling. When that happens, nothing will ever change; in fact it will just get worse. Since the Democrats are the “open borders” party, tax giveaways are more of a recruiting tool for the left than about tax collection. America wants a tax code that can be done in ten minutes. What percentage of what we have earned has Congress demanded from us? From there, we verify what we earned and we send in that amount. There are no deductions, no returns, no lobbying groups, and no perks. The person making $10.00 an hour pays the same percentage that a banker with great success on Wall Street pays. Done. Either that, or perhaps we can abolish the I.R. S. in total. Placing a small tax on all things, literally an “ALL THINGS TAX,” of only a penny or two would solve the problem in total. Everyone buys “things” according to what they can afford, so the tax code is then fair since every purchase is a tax payment. The problem here would be keeping Uncle Sam at only two cents. Before long, he will be reaching into the cookie jar up to his elbows. The other option is not allowing the federal government to collect ANY taxes, instead mandating that to the states who would pay the fed instead of the people. This latter idea will not prove popular with a dumbed down population who will be unable to understand its logic, however, so that can be all but ruled out. Maybe utopia is not going to come from D.C. on this matter, for it rarely does for anything else, no matter what they promise us. That being said, there is no reason that America can not get a decent tax code overhaul with VASTLY smaller text within a workable time frame. If not, then God help us all once they get back to healthcare talks."
"Police Uncover True Reason For Islamic Prayer Room In Hospital, Causing Health Centers To Rethink",31 MAR 2017,5070,"Islamic extremists have found a new way to meet in public space to recruit and plan attacks. The world we live in becomes more and more diverse every day. A big part of this has been a push for political correctness. There has also been a move towards inclusion and diversity within public spaces. In the name of diversity, a group of Muslims in Austria asked to create a prayer room in a local health center. This room would not be used for prayer as it was intended. Under the cover of supporting religious freedom and choice, the prayer room concealed a much darker secret. Authorities would uncover an ISIS group, essentially hiding in plain site. As the police uncovered the true reason behind the group meetings, the health center was left to rethink their choice to welcome the group. In Lower Austria, the staff at the University Hospital of St. Pölten worked to honor all faiths. This included allowing the local Muslim population to set up a prayer room at the hospital. What should have been a cultural center and a place to worship would quickly turn into something extremely dangerous. A press release would alert the community to the following: “The Islamic prayer room in the university hospital of St. Pölten allegedly served as a meeting point for ISIS sympathizers on a regular basis. Three times per week, ISIS and the Jihad in Syria were advertised there. The group of terror suspects recently arrested in St. Pölten allegedly met there, too. According to a Kurier report on Friday, there were also criminal plots hatched in the room, for example for robbing a weapons store. Karl Wurzer, a spokesman the State Prosecutor, can only verify that the suspects met and communicated with each other. The leader of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Roland Scherscher, says that they are “not pleased that information which endangers the investigations is being published.” The actual use of the prayer room would start to be revealed at the beginning of 2017. The young men who were using the space began to change. The staff noticed their behaviors became radicalized. One 19-year-old in particular began to associate with known terrorist groups. This teen would be found at a local ISIS demonstration and would be caught exchanging pictures of terrorist plots with others on social media. Local authorities would begin to investigate the activities occurring in the prayer room. In March of 2017, several arrests were made. The room was not being used for prayer; it was being used as a base for ISIS activities. The terror would be planned in this prayer room as the group met three times a week. It would become a focal point of plotting, jihad recruiting efforts for Syria, and distribution of ISIS propaganda. Five suspects in all have been arrested from the original group that was investigated. Local authorities were able to disband the cell using the hospital prayer room. The jihad recruiting is especially troubling. Beyond the basic planning of an assault, recruiting efforts stand to increase the strength of the overall terrorist organization. Because many of the fighters are foreign, it is not clear how big the Islamic State, or the Levant (ISIS), truly is. Efforts to expand the numbers only adds to the resistance. ISIS and the current ranks of the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria grew out of al-Qaeda. They are estimated to be one of the most dangerous jihadist groups currently active. They are known for their aggressive tactics and brutal takeovers. The areas that they now control in Syria and Turkey are buried under a tyrant-like ruling party. These regions have secret prisons to torture and manipulate locals. Areas of Syria that have been taken over are under brutal rule. Whether the men using the prayer room intended on doing harm with a terrorist attack or were adding to the overall ISIS efforts in Syria, the planning taking place in that small room could have been deadly. Had it not been for the observations of the hospital staff, there could have been deadly consequences. Terrorist cells are not something new to Austria. In January of this year, several were disbanded. This included the arrest of a 17-year-old that had ties to a planned attack in Vienna. It also included the arrest of 14 immigrants who were attempting to brainwash locals. Vienna would be the intended target of a foiled terror attack. The 14 who were detained were actively recruiting fighters for ISIS. They had established meetings much like the group gathering in the prayer room. The primary focus was to influence locals to become ISIS sympathizers. Groups of immigrants like these quickly blend into their local community. They live and work side-by-side with the people they are planning to hurt. By recruiting locals, jihadist fighters can easily hide. They can quietly meet in a local hospital, posing as a prayer group. They gain trust and demand respect as a religious choice. The use of the prayer room as a meeting space for ISIS is the ultimate snub of the community that was ready to welcome their beliefs."
"Trump Admin Defunds “Health” Agency, Report Shows Money Spent On Drunk Birds & Buttered Toast",22 MAR 2017,5067,"Spending at the NIH has gotten out of control as they fund junk science. Trump’s new budget will trim the waste. As the talks of the new budget hit front page news, many federal agencies cried foul over what a reduced budget would look like for them. For those working at the EPA, any cuts to their budgets will potentially cause the environment to fall apart. The health of every American is at risk with even a slight cut for the National Institute of Health (NIH), or so they would like you to believe. While many agencies are faced with possible reductions, the biggest enemy of the new administration seems to be gross overspending and some classic cases of the Washington Monument Syndrome. There are plenty of examples of worthless research done at the cost of taxpayers. The NIH has become notorious for studies that tackle hard-hitting topics like the effects of cocaine on bumble bees or if people can see Jesus in their toast. Before talks of budget cuts, these studies went on every day. With the new crackdown, the NIH is not focusing on their out of control antics. Instead, they make it appear that the basic health of the country is going to suffer. Cuts to the NIH budget could spell disaster for “science” like testing theories behind why Jesus appears on toast. The Trump administration is not stepping in to put real research at risk; they are attempting to fix the current broken system. Over funding research that is essentially useless, halts the ability of real scientists to find cures for diseases. After looking at the odd laundry list of NIH studies, it is evident that they have enjoyed money to burn for far too long. The NIH not only got a little too creative with their research ideas, but their track record for even getting a project done is pretty awful. It is estimated by some sources that only 12.5% of their research yields beneficial and reliable outcomes. An overwhelming 50% of their research projects fail to get a published result. Of the ones that get printed, most are so flawed they are fundamentally unreliable for use. Some of the more newsworthy research coming out of the NIH was tied to the sexy feelings of male goldfish. While the NIH is quick to spend their budget on research that explores why birds change their tunes when they are intoxicated or how goldfish feel sexier in social settings, they use the bait of real research to get more funding. To spend $3.6 million on studying how to make male goldfish feel sexy, they were unable to work on a cure for Zika without receiving more money. Of course, they put the most pressing need in front of Congress. The Washington Monument Syndrome means that the NIH is hiding the fake science they are actually doing behind claims that any dollar cut threatens the lives of Americans. What they are not saying is they have a long history of throwing money at a hodge podge of research. Instead of taking an honest look at where their budget could be tightened up, each agency starts on their form of damage control. They do not point to overly-funded waste but instead look for shock value. As Tate Fegley would caution the American public: “Don’t be fooled. In times of fiscal crisis, you would never expect a bureaucrat to consider it his patriotic duty to resign and find work in the private sector in order to decrease the fiscal burden on his countrymen. So why would you expect him to quietly cut the fat from his budget when there are opportunities to stoke pity or outrage among the public?” Just as the NIH seems to be broken, recent news tied to the EPA points to similar issues. While they have ignored the possibility of products like Round-Up leading to cancer, they quietly furthered the agenda of big corporations. When faced with budget cuts, they are not standing up to say they would be losing tax funds used to court these companies. Any money lost would mean immediate damage to the environment. The same environment that was quietly ignored in favor of big business. Between the botched research of the NIH and the lack of motivation on the part of the EPA, it starts to become apparent that money within their current budgets is not being used responsibly. They simply show examples of their best work and demand more money. One of Trump’s central promises of the campaign was to remove the federal government from areas it was not needed, science being one of those places. The worthless research of NIH is not moving science forward. It is a prime example of an agency not answering to anyone in regards to their work. When the federal government stops throwing money at junk science, real companies can start funding projects to work on social issues. This would include the work on curing disease, finding new treatments for medical problems, and clinical trials. This honest science would not be forced to wait behind research being done to test birds, bees, or even toast. Valuable research would take center stage. The real test of the agency’s worth should come from an honest look at how to move towards doing useful, quality research."
President Trump Makes Daring Pledge Regarding New Healthcare Bill: “Or I’m Not Signing It”,17 MAR 2017,6387,"President Trump says negotiations are needed for AHCA to pass, but he will not sign it if he doesn’t agree with the outcome. President Trump is sticking to his guns when it comes to the newly proposed, and heavily criticized, American Health Care Act (AHCA) bill. Earlier this week, he sat down for an interview on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to discuss the current state of the bill. They also talked about how the GOP plans to pass it without the 60 votes necessary to bypass the minority party. “We will take care of our people… or I’m not signing it,” said Trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcF_3Mb8nOE The AHCA bill has caused quite a stir in the government as a whole. Everyone expected Democrats like House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to rally up their posse for a battle cry as soon as the bill hit the floor. However, there also seems to be some pushback from Republican members of Congress. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) says she will not support the bill in its current form. She claims the bill “really misses the mark,” and she won’t stand by it until negotiations are made to reflect the majority of the needs of her constituents in Maine. Collins pointed out the result of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis from last week. It stated that 24 million people will lose health coverage by the year 2026 under the new bill. She also noted that many senior citizens and low-income households will have to pay more under the AHCA than Obamacare, according to the CBO report. She says that will directly affect many of her state’s citizens, and millions more around the nation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) is one of a few Republicans who have spoken out against the AHCA bill in its current state. “This bill doesn’t come close to achieving the goal of allowing low-income seniors to purchase health insurance,” she said. “We don’t want to in any way sacrifice coverage for people who need it the most.” Collins isn’t alone, either. Many other Republican politicians have come forward in opposition. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said the bill isn’t ready to be voted on just yet. He claims that right now, the bill is broken in many ways. “The bill probably can be fixed, but it’s going to take a lot of carpentry on that framework,” said Cotton. “As it’s written today, this bill in the House of Representatives cannot pass the Senate. And I believe it would have adverse consequences for millions of Americans, and it wouldn’t deliver on our promises to reduce the cost of health insurance for Americans.” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who has turned from a respected member of the GOP to an anti-Trump snowflake after joining the liberal during the election, has criticized both the president and the bill. McCain says the cuts to Medicaid are too steep to allow the bill to pass. He claims the bill needs some changes, and then maybe he can reconsider. “They need to go back to the drawing board,” he said in a statement. The Republican uprising against the bill also looks as if it has woken up the liberal left from their slumber. House Democrats finally put down their posters and marching boots and returned to work. They have introduced a plethora of amendments – some serious, some not so much – for the bill, which they claim will help the GOP gain votes from them in order to pass it. Any amendments that are introduced have to be approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in which Republicans hold the majority. Dems proposed striking the “per capita cap-based payments under Medicaid” in the AHCA and staying with the current Medicaid expansion funding. The amendment was defeated by a 31-to-23 vote. They also suggested the bill cannot pass unless the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation say it will lower out-of-pocket costs for Americans, lower premiums, and provide more people coverage. These were three promises made by President Donald Trump in the lead-up to the bill’s introduction. This was also defeated by a party-line vote of 31 to 23. The liberals even used an AHCA amendment to try and get a look at Trump’s tax returns. They introduced an amendment that said the bill cannot pass until “the individual who holds the office of President makes available to the public authenticated copies of the individual’s returns of Federal income tax for the most recent ten taxable years.” In other words, the amendment would require Trump to release his tax returns if the bill is passed. House Democrats have introduced amendments to AHCA, claiming if the changes are approved they will consider voting in favor of it. With a lack of support from the GOP, as well as House Democrats taking every opportunity to be as childish as they can be, President Trump has his hands full. Still, he keeps moving forward with his healthcare mission for the American people. During the interview, the President was asked if the current bill was “the best the Republicans could do after seven years of thinking about it?” His reply: “I think we’re going to have negotiation, but you have to understand, we only have 52. We only have two-vote — we have a two-vote margin. And you’re always — you know, to get 52 people is very hard. If we had 60 — or 60 votes, we could do something different.” Trump seems to have one ally in the House that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. When asked about House Speaker Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI), the president was very upfront and honest. “I think he’s on board with the American people,” he said. “I do believe that strongly. I think he is on board with my presidency. I think he wants to make it very successful. I like him. We had our run-ins…but I think he is very much of — he wants to do the right thing. That I believe 100%. We’re going to take care of the people, and by the way, if we’re not going to take care of the people, I’m not signing anything. … I’m in a little way, I’m an arbitrator.” He continued that health care reform would be a three-phase process. House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) will no doubt be Trump’s best ally in the negotiations for AHCA. As the tension heats up against the AHCA, it will be a good change of pace to see the government coming together to discuss the bill and hopefully reach a solution. Perhaps this will become part of Trump’s plan to unite the parties, or perhaps it always was."
"Ryan Reveals Much-Needed Facts On New Healthcare Plan, Tells Exactly How We Can Make It Work",14 MAR 2017,6096,"Speaker Paul Ryan discusses the details of AHCA after the CBO report on the bill is released. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has taken some time to clarify some vital information on the new American Health Care Act, or AHCA, bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. His clarifications come on the heels of a CBO report that suggests 24 million citizens would lose their health insurance if the new bill passes. According to the CBO report, an estimated 24 million people would lose health insurance by 2026. The report claims the uninsured rate would be higher than it was before the ACA. “Not only would the absolute number of uninsured people increase, the share of the population without coverage would be higher than it was before the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010; nearly 1-in-5 people under age 65 would not have health insurance by 2026, according to CBO estimates (people 65 and older generally qualify for Medicare).” The CBO report claims that 24 million people will lose coverage through the AHCA. The report blames this massive drop in covered citizens on the proposed changes to the current Medicaid program and the repeal of the individual mandate implemented by Obamacare that requires everyone to have insurance and penalizes those who refuse coverage. From the changes to Medicaid alone, the CBO report suggests that nearly 14 million people would lose coverage. Another seven million are expected to drop their coverage due to the absence of an individual mandate. The remaining roughly three million would lose coverage due to changes in subsidies and other miscellaneous reasons. The report also touches on increases in insurance premiums, which are another main focus for many people wanting to get away from the grasp of Obamacare. Per the report, insurance premiums are expected to fluctuate over time. They will go up and down, mostly depending on the amount of people who opt for coverage at any given point. This is only expected in the private sector, though, not within public or employer-backed programs. The release of the report surely sent many people into a frenzy, mainly the media. A lot of questions have risen from the results, as well as the reasons for them, which the CBO report tries to explain. Speaker Ryan has owned up to every single detail since the beginning of the AHCA bill. He hasn’t backed down from criticism, but instead chose to be more direct and clear in giving people a better understanding of what the bill entails and how we can make it work as a whole. Since the report, he has also taken a stand to counter the expected outcomes that are outlined in the document. Last Sunday, Ryan met with CBS’s John Dickerson for an interview to speak on the behalf of the AHCA bill and the progress Congress has made so far. In the interview, Dickerson asked Ryan exactly how many people he thought would lose coverage if the bill passes. Ryan responded: “It’s up to the people… are we providing a system where people have access to health insurance if they choose to do so? And the answer is yes. But are we going to have some nice looking spreadsheet that says we, the government of the American—of the United States are going to make people buy something and, therefore, they’re all going to buy it? No. That’s the fatal conceit of Obamacare in the first place.” Speaker Ryan spoke on behalf of the AHCA to clarify the CBO report’s findings and discuss how the bill will work. He goes on to to say that it is not the government’s job to force anything upon American citizens. “It is our job to have a system where people can get universal access to affordable coverage if they choose to do so or not. That’s what we’re going to be accomplishing,” he said. Ryan is basically saying that if citizens don’t want health coverage, or cannot pay for it at a certain point, they should not be punished for opting out, which is essentially what Obamacare does. Through Obamacare, anyone who does not have health coverage – at any point throughout the year – will be penalized for the lack of coverage when it comes time to file taxes. In 2014 alone, over 7.5 million people had to pay a penalty for not having health insurance. Many of those people couldn’t afford insurance, much less the penalty for not having it. The way Obamacare is set up, individuals and families can opt in to their preferred plan through the ACA marketplace. For those below the poverty line, in most cases, there are programs that allow assistance to afford insurance, which is where much of the increase in Medicaid patients comes from. Again, this happens in most cases. For many others, they fall into the abyss between the two, known as the ‘I can’t afford a marketplace plan, but I’m also not poor enough to get assistance’ gap. That is just one of the many issues with Obamacare. These people are still penalized for not having the insurance when they can’t even qualify for it! The AHCA gets rid of the mandate, and the problems that come along with it. If an individual or a family cannot afford coverage, they will receive help through programs like Medicaid. Medicaid will be able to help more people who are truly struggling because many will opt out of the program since they will no longer be penalized if they don’t have it. If they do choose to have health coverage, the AHCA has a system in place to give tax credits to those citizens. Basically, if you purchase coverage through the AHCA, you will receive a credit to cover some of the costs. So no punishment for not having insurance, but there will be a reward if you do. This is one way the AHCA works to encourage more citizens to opt in, according to Ryan. Under the AHCA, tax credits will be given to those who choose to get health coverage. Many will lose coverage, as the CBO report suggests, but it will not be for the reasons it claims. The AHCA promises to help those in need, but refuses to punish those who feel they don’t need the coverage. With the implementation of the AHCA bill, there will be no more government control over citizens’ health."
GOP Unveils House Republicans’ American Health Care Act To Replace ObamaCare,7 MAR 2017,5367,"Obama and Democrats will not be pleased with any changes to their treasured ACA To those who have been eagerly anticipating the Republican’s answer to Obamacare, this may come as a disappointment. The plan, named The American Health Care Act, will look like Obamacare in far too many ways for people to be comfortable. Others believe that holding on to parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows the GOP to strike a compromise. But will it be what Americans need? The new legislation gives much of the power back to the states, keeping in line with President Trump’s vow to do just that. He believes the federal government has taken on too much power and he intends to see that remedied. House Republicans addressed some of the changes in a statement; “Our plan delivers relief from all of Obamacare’s taxes, including dismantling taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health-insurance premiums, and medical devices. And we immediately eliminate the individual and employer mandate penalties, which forced millions of people into Obamacare plans they don’t want and cannot afford.” One major change is the Patient and State Stability Fund. This will give $100 billion over the course of a decade to “help stabilize the markets and provide funding for low-income Americans.” There is no arguing that this is needed. Obamacare has devastated the healthcare market, forcing doctors out of business, raising costs dramatically, and really only helping the insurance companies in the end. The people who should be benefitting, the elderly, the poor, and children, have not experienced any of the relief they need. Addressing the same issues, the new bill contains language aimed at seniors. The American Health Care Act will offer a tax credit based on age. Purchasers under 30 would receive a $2,000 tax credit. 30-39: $2,500 40-49: $3,000 50-59: $3,500 Over 60: $4,000 Money left over after the tax credits will then be put in to a Health Savings Account (HSA). The new bill also increased the amount individuals are allowed to put in HSAs, in some cases, doubling it. The GOP sees their new bill as the answer, but is it a cop out? Other radical changes include those to Medicaid. The bill will provide states with “per capita allotment per enrollee, giving the states more flexibility to craft and administer their programs.” Medicaid expansion will be “phased out by Dec. 31, 2019, allowing states to keep the enhanced match for new beneficiaries before 2020.” After Jan. 1, states will only be able to sign up eligible individuals through the traditional Federal Medical Assistance Percentages. The 19 states that chose not to expand Medicaid would be provided $10 billion between now and 2022 to assist in the transition period. Many of the taxes created by the ACA will be repealed including the Medical Device Tax and health insurance taxes.  Other taxes will be continued which will dissuade some lawmakers from supporting the new bill. Given how much controversy surrounded the “penalty” for not having healthcare, it is surprising to see that Republicans kept a similar statute. “Those who drop coverage for longer than 63 days would be subject to a 30% late-enrollment surcharge in addition to their base premium in an attempt to encouraged continued coverage.” While not as severe as the Obamacare penalties, this could prove to be a point of contention going forward. Rising costs of Obamacare, far beyond what was promised, have left many without options The new healthcare mandate does keep several of the most popular pieces of the ACA law. This will keep some liberals happy, but for most, it won’t be enough. On the Republican side, the continued existence of the penalty will be upsetting. People with preexisting conditions will still be protected, which is incredibly important to many. Their conditions will not subject them to denial of coverage or increased costs. Children who are on their parent’s health insurance will be allowed to stay, covering them until they turn 26. Republicans emphasized the need for a smooth transition. One of the biggest complaints from Democrats has been that repeal will leave millions without coverage. This new bill aims to reassure people. “We are working to give all Americans peace of mind about their health care. We will have a stable transition toward a system that empowers patients with more choices and lower costs.” Of course, many are not satisfied. While Trump’s administration likely took this route to avoid some roadblocks, it is being called weak by opponents. Democrats have often referred to it as “Obamacare Lite,” taking stabs at the Republicans. The GOP dismisses these claims stating, “We repeal all those taxes, those mandates, those subsidies, there’s nothing left there. We deliver on President Trump’s promise to repeal and begin replacing with two big principles, one, restore state control of health care and get it out of Washington and also restore the free market, to give individuals the power and the freedom to choose a plan that’s right for them.” This new bill appears to be one of concession. Anticipating problems from liberals and wanting to appease the public, Republicans did not take as hard a line with the new laws as some expected. The question remains, is this the best the GOP can offer America or did the Republicans take the easy way out?"
"Trump Gets Involved In Healthcare, Says It’s “Complex” But GOP Now Has A “Really Good” Solution",28 FEB 2017,6665,"Trump Has A Plan In Place As the first 100 days of President Trump’s term continue, the question of healthcare is weighing on the minds of many. The repeal and replacement of the ACA, or Obamacare, is inevitable, but many are wondering when it will happen. One of the biggest issues is the fear of losing coverage during the repeal process. State governors have been vocal about ensuring their citizens will not lose health coverage during the time the GOP repeals and replaces the Obama-era healthcare bill. On Monday, conservative governors from across the nation met with Trump at the White House during a weekend of meetings in Washington D.C. During the meeting, Trump touched on healthcare and aimed at putting their minds at ease, and he also spoke on bringing the Republican Party together during the process. There is a lot of talk in the media about the Trump administration working on proposals while Congress works on their own, which seems to put them in separate categories. While this is not even close to being true, Trump feels that if they find common ground now, and show the American people that they are indeed working together in the early stages, the complex process will be much easier to tackle as a united front. President Trump also talked about the difficulty of working with healthcare, no matter who you are. President Donald Trump speaks at the National Governors Association meeting at the White House. Trump admitted during the meeting that “nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated.” Later in a post-meeting interview, he reiterated his point by saying, “I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject.” The difficulties President Trump speaks of include a multitude of different things. One of these complexities, which we have heard about a lot in the media, is the battle between full or staggered access to healthcare. While the thought of living in a world where we can all just go to the doctor, get the medicines we need, and live full, healthy lives sounds appealing, it just isn’t that simple sometimes. Having staggered access to care, on the other hand, means people who are statistically healthier may pay a little more, but that money helps counter the costs of taking care of other people who tend to be in poorer health. Both parties have gone back and forth on this issue.  The GOP also wants to ensure political bipartisanship during the repeal process. By having both parties agree on more decisions, and ultimately fight toward the same solutions, the government is making sure the citizens of the United States, and our healthcare, are at the forefront of discussion. If we are to have opposing sides while we are waiting for the ACA to be repealed and replaced with another healthcare plan, it will only drag out the process even longer than it needs to be. While the GOP holds the majority in both houses, they also understand how important a bipartisan agreement on big legislation such as healthcare can be. The Republican majority is working toward creating a bipartisan front to take on the task of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. During his campaign, and throughout his first month as President, Trump has spoken about putting America first in any decision the government makes – from international affairs to trade, and even in healthcare. By instituting an ‘America First’ policy in health care reform, our government is taking steps in ensuring no foreign entities can profit off of America’s ill citizens. President Trump has also held meetings with pharmaceutical companies to discuss lowering the costs of much needed medications for patients, and he has also spoken out against companies that raise prices simply for the sake of profit. Unlike what we saw in 2009 with the Democratic Party taking the reigns and using their majority power to push Obamacare through late at night, the Republican Party is trying to bring Congress together. Both Congress and President Trump are choosing to ignore the media claims that Obamacare is getting last-minute support from both parties. Trump explains that even if the numbers are true, it simply means that people are nervous about the coming change, which is normal when something like healthcare is on the table. He claims there is not really bipartisan support for the ACA, but rather ‘cold feet’ due to the uncomfortable decisions Congress is about to have to make. Even as the GOP readies itself to work alongside Dems in Congress, Republican leaders also know the importance of creating a case before stating it. The majority party is currently looking for common ground within itself before opening the floor for discussion with the Democratic members of Congress. This is a vital move that guarantees a united front in the Republican Party throughout the entire process of repealing and replacing the ACA. It will be interesting to see a united GOP work alongside their Democratic counterparts. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have been drafting their own proposals for the replacement of Obamacare. The timeline of the process is also very important. As many citizens and government officials have become weary of the impending crush of Obamacare, Congress and President Trump need to make sure that it all happens at once, or as close together as possible. Any gaps between repealing the ACA and replacing it can consequently leave millions of Americans without the coverage they need. Trump has confirmed his plan to repeal and replace the bill simultaneously, although with any kind of setbacks, this could change. “It will be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day. Could be the same hour,” President Trump said in a news conference in early January. The cost of monthly premiums before and after Obamacare for men and women. The Trump administration and Republican members of Congress are keeping healthcare reform a high priority. Like anything President Trump puts his name on, any bill that passes will have to be perfect. As we saw with Obama, when you rush to implement something just because you want to make a change, it seldom works out for anyone involved. Obamacare raised premiums for many Americans, and still left millions without coverage – even Democrats agree. Our healthcare system, which is “disastrous” according to Trump, has the potential to see better days under the new administration. By passing a healthcare bill that is good for all Americans, Trump is teaching Obama and his supporters a valuable lesson."
"John Hopkins Issues Analysis Of Trump’s Mental Health, Claiming They’ve Found Something",13 FEB 2017,5467,"Accusing the President of being psychotic How does a psychoanalyst diagnose someone they have never met? True mental health professionals will tell you that it is impossible. The clues that can be gained from watching someone on television or talking with people who know the subject are just not adequate to make an accurate diagnosis. Morals and rules have rarely slowed down the liberals. They have a tendency of jumping to conclusions and coming up with a rationale afterwards. It seems that even “professionals” are getting caught up in anti-Trump rhetoric. John D. Gartner, a practicing psychotherapist also taught psychiatric residents at Johns Hopkins University Medical School has come forward to tell America that he has diagnosed President Trump with a very serious psychiatric illness. “Donald Trump is dangerously mentally ill and temperamentally incapable of being president.  He has “malignant narcissism”, which is different from narcissistic personality disorder and which is incurable. It’s obvious from Trump’s behavior that he meets the diagnostic criteria for the disorder, which include anti-social behavior, sadism, aggressiveness, paranoia and grandiosity.” That is a very drastic statement from a man who has never met Trump in person. Gartner seems not to care that he has violated ethics. The Goldwater Rule prohibits giving a professional diagnosis of a public figure without personally examining the person. This doctor claims he can diagnose Trump without having met him Gartner justifies himself stating, “Trump’s personality disorder (which includes hypomania) is also displayed through a lack of impulse control and empathy, and a feeling that people don’t recognize their greatness. We’ve seen enough public behavior by Donald Trump now that we can make this diagnosis indisputably.” Another bold claim and a false one. There are many people who have and will continue to dispute the ridiculous diagnosis. The definition of Malignant Narcissism, given by Dr. Carrie Barron, a board-certified psychiatrist at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, portrays effected individuals as scary, dangerous and ruthless. “Malignant Narcissists will go to great lengths to achieve their aim.  They can be intelligent, high functioning (hold an important job for example) soft-spoken, charming, tearful/seemingly emotional, gracious, well mannered, kind and have the ability to form relationships. They may lie, falsely accuse, dramatize, smear, cheat, steal, manipulate, accuse, blame or twist to get what they want and feel justified in doing so. Because they are entitled, egocentric and desperate, they do not experience it as wrong. They are determined to gratify their wishes and furious if thwarted. Their desire can be so consuming that there is little comprehension of, respect for or ability to empathize with the other.  They lack guilt or remorse and tend to feel or pronounce that it is they who have been mistreated. They can be of any gender, race or social class.” President Trump’s own behavior challenges this behavior, even from a layperson’s understanding. He has demonstrated empathy and remorse multiple times. He has blown away the claims that he is racist and bigoted, his diverse cabinet and advisers are proof of that. In addition, it would be difficult to find anyone who would refer to the President as “soft-spoken.” His blunt speeches are one of the ways he won over much of America. Another researcher from Oxford claims that President Trump ranks just under Saddam Hussein and just over Adolf Hitler on the psychopath scale. Of course, they mention that Hillary Clinton is right up there on the scale as well. That psychiatrist, Kevin Dutton, presents a different view. “Some of those traits, such as fearlessness or stress immunity, can be positive. One, cold-heartedness, can contribute to good and bad leadership. Both great and terrible leaders score higher than the general population for psychopathic traits, but it is the mix of those traits that determines success. For example, someone who scores highly for being influential, fearless and cold hearted could be a decisive leader who can make dispassionate decisions. If those traits are accompanied by a high score on blaming others, they might be a genocidal demagogue.” When Trump does this, then he can be compared to Hitler It may be difficult to understand that perspective but a look at history reveals the truth. Hitler was a dynamic leader but was also a psychopath. Without that part of his personality, he might have accomplished great things instead of killing millions. However, President Trump is not Hitler although liberals have often drawn parallels. There are quite a few important differences; the lack of willingness to murder for his cause and no belief that there is only one superior race. They may both be able to gain a following but our leader does not intend to use his power for mass genocide. The left has used Donald Trump’s passion against him, turning it from a strong emotion to a psychopathic trait. They claim he “lost his mind” when he lost the appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. It is unlikely that his angry and determined Tweet qualifies as a break in sanity. The hopeless left is clinging to straws, willing to compare our current President to a mass murderer for the sole purpose of trying to discredit him. Their actions demonstrate much more insanity then President Trump ever has."
Dems Unveil New Bill With Force: Psychiatrist In White House To Test Trump’s Mental Health Daily,10 FEB 2017,5194,"They’re Going To Make Trump Use One If you listen to what a Democrat has to say about President Donald Trump, you’re going to get the usual assortment of adjectives that have been used to describe the 45th president. They will say he’s racist, Islamophobic, Xenophobic, and pretty much everything in between. Some have even made the occasional comment that Trump is crazy. They think that his policies are an indication that Trump needs major psychiatric help, despite the fact that these policies are going to be for the good of the American people. That’s how liberals think though. If it’s against their thinking, it’s wrong and crazy. Unfortunately that style of thinking has come from the Democrats that are currently sitting in Congress. They have discussed more and more about mental health and how it is something that needs to be discussed. That is why a Democrat plans to file a bill that requires the White House to have an in-house psychiatrist. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu has plans to file that exact bill. “I’m looking at it from the perspective of, if there are questions about the mental health of the president of the United States, what may be the best way to get the president treatment?” Lieu reportedly told the Huffington Post. “We’re now in the 21st century. Mental health is just as important as physical health,” he later added. Okay while that might be true, what is going to stop the Democrats from making Trump see a psychiatrist if he proposes something that they don’t agree with? I Can See Democrats Twisting This To Their Advantage Democrats are already quick to say something about people that go against their thinking. Seriously think about how many times you’ve been called racist or Islamophobic or Xenophobic or misogynistic for simply disagreeing with a Democrat? Lieu has already talked about his concerns about President Trump’s mental health, even once suggesting that he could use a mental health evaluation. How are we going to let this Democratic representative come up with this bill when he has raised concerns about this in the past? It’s just going to strike fears that they will manipulate the law to suit their needs. Lieu tweeted out, “Last 24 hrs on Twitter, Donald Trump went on rant about ‘death & destruction,’ ‘FAKE NEWS,’ & ‘evil.’ Should he get mental health exam?” For one thing, death and destruction is everywhere in the world. How many times do you hear about terror attacks killing innocent people? As for the “FAKE NEWS,” it has already been shown that the media is going to do whatever they can to portray Trump in a bad light. Hell, the New York Times even released several editorials saying that Trump shouldn’t go after radical Islam. If that isn’t crazy, then nothing will be. The NYT Has Shown They’re Against Trump Too During Lieu’s interview with the Huffington Post, the lawmaker said that “it is not normal” for the president to make a mention of all those topics in a tweet within 24 hours. He has also claimed, and maintained, that Trump is divorced from reality. Meanwhile President Obama was allowed to say that they don’t know the reason that a terror attack happened even though it was clearly radical Islam. That doesn’t make a tremendous amount of sense, but then again dealing with Democrats never makes any sense. “His disconnection from the truth is incredibly disturbing. …When you add on top of that his stifling of dissent, his attacks on the free press and his attacks on the legitimacy of judiciary, that then takes us down the road toward authoritarianism. That’s why I’ve concluded he is a danger to the republic,” Lieu said. Again, they are making this claim because Trump’s views don’t coincide with the Democrats. What is to stop the Democrats from using that in-house psychiatrist to fight their battles against Trump? Trump Doesn’t Need A Psychiatrist Because He Has Different Views Like most Democratic ideas, this has good intentions. After all, if the leader of the nation is not well, what does that mean for the nation? Unfortunately they are going to twist and manipulate the rule to fit their political motives and that is what is going to stop the bill from being effective. Besides, Democrats have been long opposed to the Trump presidency. After all, the Democratic Party has claimed that they don’t need evidence to impeach the president of the United States. If you ask me, that is very telling of some mental unstableness, considering that evidence is needed in anything. Not only that, but there are members of the Democratic Party that could stand to use some psychiatric help. After all, Nancy Pelosi just went into a press conference where she said she couldn’t work with President Bush rather than President Trump. That is literally an eight year difference. Go ahead and tell me that something isn’t wrong with that. Share this article to show that the Democrats are going to introduce a bill that would put a psychiatrist into the White House. As with all Democratic causes, it starts off as a good intention but they are soon going to twist it to fit their political motive. That is not going to help anyone. Then again, nothing that Democrats do really helps anyone."
4 Lies About ObamaCare That Are Keeping Trump’s New Healthcare Plan From Passing Unanimously,20 JAN 2017,4884,"Obama making a point Is it possible that Obamacare is the only way to organize healthcare for the USA, and there is absolutely no other way to do it? The central argument for Obamacare has always been that it represents the best of all possible worlds. The standard retort to criticisms of Obamacare has always been that no one could do any better. Add to that the fact that it issued forth from the holiest of holies, Obama himself, and the word from on high has been that the smart money is on Obamacare, and anyone who attempts to repeal and replace will do so at their own peril. In a way, that is the Democrat argument for everything. They always represent the best of all possible worlds and it is always a place where some consultants figured out what is best for us. In this particular case, the answer for a government health care program that would finally be 100 percent inclusive was to create a law that says everyone has to have health insurance or pay a fine. Some people like Obamacare, but most people do not Oila! 100 percent health care coverage for all, what an amazing accomplishment. Meanwhile, it turns out the prospect of free market competition was not included either, so no matter how much professional Democrat politicians love Obamacare, the health insurers themselves are dropping out. They are dropping out because they do not make money, but instead lose money. When they drop out, it necessitates rate hikes among the remaining insurers so they can make money. That dynamic alone is crashing the system. Most people, in most states, saw premiums rise Insurers cannot make money because young people do not buy into Obamacare and choose instead to pay the fine, which is cheaper. Many young to middle-aged adults are doing the same thing for the same reason. So the healthiest people, opt out, leaving the most costly patients over-represented, and the whole thing starts to leak like a sieve. And all the while, Obama tells everyone that if they do not vote to continue all this liberal madness he will take it personally. Obamacare failed on every level What Obama did not count on was the simple fact that Americans take it personally when they are lied to, neglected, and abused, over and over again. Perhaps the most underrated and unexpected line of the Trump candidacy was the simple, yet unassailable ‘What do you have to lose?” He uttered that to an audience of black Americans, but it resonated with a lot of us. Essentially, that leaves us preparing to watch President Trump;s administration move to repeal and replace Obamacare, and this amid howls and screams, mixed with plenty of lies, platitudes, and truisms. In short, there are four reasons we can be sure that Obamacare may be a disaster, but that does not mean replacing it will automatically result in disaster. Four Big Lies About Obamacare Big Lie #1: If we repeal Obamacare, 20 million people will lose health care coverage
 Big Lie #2: If we repeal Obamacare, it will be bad for mental health care
Claims that millions of people whose mental health is insured now will lose coverage are based on Medicaid populations, and those people are not going to get kicked off Medicaid. Big Lie #3:  If we repeal Obamacare, that will lead to cutting drug prices, which will lower quality of health care 
Only a lobbyist for big pharma would say something like that. Everybody knows that drug prices are artificially inflated in the U.S. — President Trump has been outspoken about the fact that there is no reason drugs here cost four to 10 times more than in Canada. There is always more than one way to do anything. One proposal for lowering drug prices in this country is for President Trump to institute “most favored nation” status for drug pricing, at which point the government could then invoke consumer protection acts and criminally prosecute pricing violations by the drug companies. that continue to abuse Americans. In short, health care is a complex creature, and we need a long-term, creative, multi-pronged solution rolled out carefully, and upgraded continuously. It should also be as bipartisan a project as possible because it is for all Americans, not just people of one party, and the politicians in Washington D.C. are supposed to represent us all. Obamacare was a purely Democrat concoction, and that was a constraining factor as well. In retrospect, Obama was not the Pope, and Obamacare was not the word conveyed directly to him, come down from on high, which mystically revealed the only way to do health care in America. There is something uniquely American about the refusal to assume there is only one way to do something. Something in the American spirit and character, when told there is only one dysfunctional way out of a problem, will always find a way to chop through the backwoods, blaze a new trail, and find a completely new way to look at the world."

The Judge Has Ruled: Terrorist Connected To Bin Laden Set Free To Preserve His “Mental Health”,3 JAN 2017,5295,"A British judge just granted permission for a known Algerian terrorist to remain in America. An Algerian terrorist just triumphed in a legal battle that’s been brewing for the past 21 years. The jihadist won the enviable right to live as citizen in the UK rather than be returned to his home country. Legal restrictions shield the man’s name, who’s known only as “G” in the press. The disabled man arrived in Britain in 1995 and used a fake passport in his attempt to claim asylum. In 2001 serious efforts were made to deport him as it was discovered that he was an active member of Algerian terrorist group, “Group For Call And Combat” (GSPC). Government officials hurled serious accusations at G, claiming: “Your activities on behalf of the group and of extremist fighters in Chechnya include sponsoring young Muslims in the UK to go to Afghanistan to train for jihad.” Terrorism has taken root in the UK. Astonishingly, a judge made the bleeding-heart decision to allow the terrorist to live freely in the UK, going so far as to slash a previous court’s ruling that required G to regularly report himself to the local police station. What prompted the judge’s leniency? He claimed to be worried about the man’s mental health. Of course any rational human being would have serious concerns about G’s mental health–he’s a terrorist for crying out loud! Obviously something is rattling the wrong way in his violent little mind. However that’s doesn’t excuse the gravity of his crimes. He’s associated with Osama Bin Laden, one of the worst villains of our lifetime. He used his influence to urge malleable young minds to destroy themselves in jihad. Monsters deserve to be treated as such. There are literally millions of goodhearted, strong people who are mired in desperate situations and would benefit greatly if granted permission to live in the UK. Why is a judge wasting his sympathy on a grizzled criminal with little to offer his local community? A terrorist with connections to Osama Bin Laden was just granted permission to live in America. “Mr Justice Collins made his decision on the belief that the suspect no longer poses a threat to national security,” reports The Express. How nice. The old terrorist gets to retire in peace. The refugee crisis has been made significantly worse by the interference of misguided liberals who believed they were doing a good deed when they fought for “sanctuary cities” and “amnesty.” Illegals from every cesspool and war-zone on in the world are clambering to claim asylum in the West. So many applications are flooding the system that apparently even known terrorists are no longer deported. Granting clemency to G is an insult to the thousands of innocent lives sacrificed to terrorists. The fact that G has aged into an old man doesn’t mitigate the horror of his crimes. It’s also unwise to dismiss him as merely a feeble old man. He’s been suspected of luring young men to jihad for years. There’s no reason to believe that he won’t continue to do so. Brutal terrorist attacks became disgustingly commonplace in the last few years. The entire Muslim universe is convulsed with rage. Their insanity is rapidly infecting the West as they slip in and out of our borders. Christmas was marred by a horrific smattering of attacks. Violent, crazed Muslim “refugees” sneaked into Europe and wreaked havoc in the name of Allah. Scene of the Berlin Christmas market attack Anis Amri, another radical Islamist long known to authorities, plowed a truck through a crowd of shoppers at a Christmas market in Berlin. Amri’s rap sheet was speckled with violence years before he committed the massacre. Dozens of party-goers were slaughtered at an exclusive New Year’s Eve party in Istanbul. ISIS has already claimed credit for the attack. Sympathy towards terrorists is both wasted and dangerous. Pray for them if you wish, yearn for the cleansing of their soul, but don’t confuse them with simple criminals. They’re not tough guys with a heart of gold. They’re monsters. Killers. Violent creatures responsible for the destruction of thousands of lives. Society needs to free itself from the noxious influence exerted by the millions of migrants pouring into the West. Years into the refugee crisis our country is noticeable weaker rather than stronger. Sternness is necessary. America is not required to mother the rejects from other countries. Too many Americans struggle to feed themselves for us to devote precious resources towards foreigners. Aftermath of the horrific Istanbul nightclub attack. Terrorists of any age and sex need to be deported. In fact, their deportation should be a priority. If Angela Merkel felt the same way, perhaps the Christmas market slaughter could have been avoided. In a few weeks we’ll finally be rid of Obama. His weak policies failed to protect our borders. Viewpoints like Obama’s are what encouraged the judge to let G leave court unscathed. In contrast, President-elect Donald Trump built his winning campaign largely on promises to buckle down on immigration and face the radical Islam problem. Unknown numbers of dangerous radicals lurk in cities across the US. Trump’s administration promises to create such an arid environment for them that many are likely to abandon their purpose and become harmless fanatics."
"Obama Administration Just Took $170M From Healthcare, Instead Money Will Go To Deserving Illegals",1 DEC 2016,5445,"“No soup for you!” One of my favorite books as a kid was “If You Give A Mouse A Cookie.” Have you read it? It’s a simple story with a lot of wisdom. One day kind a boy finds a poor, hungry mouse. The mouse begs him for a bite of a cookie and the kind boy gives him a whole cookie to the hungry little mouse. And that’s when the trouble begins. If you give a mouse a cookie… After eating his fill, the mouse then complains that the cookie has made him thirsty. Could he please have a tiny glass of milk for his dry mouth? The boy kindly obliges and when the mouse has drunk its fill, he mentions how tired the milk and cookie have made him. Could he please have a small bed to take a short nap in? Once again the boy obliges the mouse and makes a matchbox bed for him to rest in. Unfortunately, though, the matchbox is a bit chilly–could he have a small blanket? Of course! How about a small pillow for his tired head? Of course! By Felicia You get the idea. If you give a mouse a cookie, you’ll end up giving a whole lot more than you expected. It’s a simple idea, yet it seems to escape our brilliant political leaders. According to Breitbart News, “President Barack Obama’s administration has transferred $167 million in just one month from programs which aid Americans to the programs which feed, house, school, and entertain a wave of illegal alien minors.” Talk about giving out some cookies! Unfortunately, they call come from the jar meant to feed those pesky little mice known as “American citizens.” Every day an average of 255 illegal alien minors are registered at the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Service. As ov November 27, the Department of HHS already has 11,200 illegals in its care. How is this all being funded? HHS is getting the money for the illegals by cutting funds from programs which benefit vulnerable Americans. The non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) reports that the cookies are crumbling like this: “$14 million was taken from the Health Resources and Services Administration, including $4.5 million from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and $2 million from the Maternal and Child Health program” $4.5 million in AIDS research and child health care–gone, scattered like cookie crumbs! “$14 million was taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for contagious disease prevention and treatment and other critical public health programs” During a potential Zika virus plague, the CDC loses 14 million glasses of milk. “$72 million from the National Institutes of Health, for research on cancer, diabetes, drug abuse, mental health, infectious diseases and much more” 72 million blankets to cover major disease research–tossed out! And the hits just keep coming: + $8 million from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, for treatment and prevention programs and another $8 million from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; + $39 million from the Children and Families Services Program; + $4 million from the Aging and Disability Services Programs; + $3 million from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, including more than $1 million from the Pandemic Influenza and BioShield Fund. Incredibly, HHS is also asking Congress for another $1-$2 billion by Dec. 9 to “meet our legal and humanitarian obligations” and avoid “stranding” illegal aliens at the border. That’s a lot of Christmas cookie and milk. Make no mistake, this is not limited to health care and it’s not limited to America, either. Just this week we’ve seen the violent Somali attacker on the Ohio State University excused by liberals because there were too many racists on campus, or not enough Muslim prayer rooms, or maybe the scent of bacon was too strong some mornings in the cafeteria. Anything but admitting the young man was a dangerous adherent to an unstable religion! Across the Atlantic, we see the same Muslim-immigrant chauvinism. I won’t even talk about Sweden or Germany, since both are so flooded with Muslim refugees, and so crippled by multiculturalism, that I’m not alone in thinking they are both done for. In Europe in general, crosses in public are being removed so as not to “offend” Muslims–even in Christian schools and hospitals! An even more outrageous example of Muslim chauvinism is happening in Scotland, of all places. Apparently, plans to give Catholics priority at one of Scotland’s top Catholic schools “have been branded ‘discriminatory’ and ‘divisive’ by”–you guessed it–“Muslim parents.” St. Ninian’s High in Giffnock is one of the country’s best state schools and has had an admission waiting list for years. The local civic council announced plans to give baptized Catholics priority over people of other faiths and of none. A Catholic school for Catholic students? I’m shocked and outraged! Subtle, huh? In response, Muslim parents said it was “discriminatory or divisive against other faith groups and that implementing the proposal could result in less diversity within denominational schools.” When Muslims schools stop showing preference to Muslim students, I’ll listen. Otherwise, this is just typical liberal whining hiding behind the Qur’an. Surprisingly, and encouragingly, the council said “72 per cent of people were happy with the plans and that it was pushing ahead with the proposals,” but would relax them so that applicants with a sibling already at the school would get a spot."
Hillary Campaign Moves To Compile Health Records In Historic Release,12 SEP 2016,4866,"Sick Hillary Will Have To Release Medical Records This Week During this election, Donald Trump has been very open, honest, and straightforward about many things. While he has received a ton of backlash, at least he was a man of his word and stood by his beliefs. He has also released nearly all of his medical records and many other documents to prove transparency. Hillary, however, has been one of the least transparent and most hidden candidates to walk this planet. While dismissing questions surrounding her health as past of the vast right-wing conspiracy, Hillary Clinton also refused to release her medical records. Polls have shown a majority of voters want both main presidential candidates to release their health records, and even President Obama’s former physician called for Hillary to release her medical records (and he’s voting for her!). Donald Trump had offered to release his records in exchange for Hillary releasing hers, but she never took him up on that offer. Hillary refuses to answer the questions surrounding her health, and it has become a major phenomenon trying to determine whether or not she is fit to run for office. Amid all of these scandals, Hillary has decided to release some of her medical records this week. Hillary was avoiding answering questions about her health for as long as she could, but now her campaign knows they have to release the information. Too many reports are circling about her problems and they are losing ground on the campaign trail. Hillary Clinton will release additional medical information this week, a spokesman said Monday, after her campaign was criticized for waiting to reveal that she had pneumonia. The 68-year-old Clinton left early from a Sept. 11 ceremony in New York City on Sunday morning, looking unsteady and requiring support to enter a van. The Democratic presidential nominee’s doctor later said she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday and got overheated at the event, but was “recovering nicely.” Experts Acknowledging Her Health Is A Real Concern Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told MSNBC that Clinton would release more medical records this week, after broad criticism of the campaign for not disclosing the pneumonia diagnosis earlier. Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump and conservative media outlets have speculated about Clinton’s possible health issues, though she faces no known ailments other than the pneumonia. Trump also announced that he’ll be releasing a detailed report on his own health this week. Clinton suffers from “no other undisclosed condition,” Fallon told MSNBC. He added that she will go back on the campaign trail later this week after she canceled a planned trip to California to rest. “I think that in retrospect we could have handled it better, in terms of providing more information more quickly,” Fallon said about the aftermath of Clinton leaving the event Sunday. The 70-year-old Trump, a noted junk food enthusiast, has also promised to release more health information this week. He told CNBC on Monday morning that he hopes Clinton gets well soon. Trump would become the oldest president ever elected, while Clinton would be the second oldest. Yet Trump’s doctors have also argued he would be the healthiest candidate to ever serve as president! Think this is the only condition Hillary is suffering from, as her campaign spokesperson says? Given her history of lying, it’s not ridiculous to have a reasonable doubt. And while the campaign promises to release more medical records, it would be naive to believe Hillary and her team would be completely forthcoming about — well, about ANYTHING. This campaign is full of Clintonian liars that will evade the truth at all costs. They are willing to allow Hillary to destroy America, and we cannot trust them with anything. Remember Hillary Spitting Mucus Back Into Her Glass As She Took A Sip? She’s Ill Something is wrong with Hillary Clinton’s health, and her campaign is not being honest about it. And the longer her team lies about what’s happening and stonewalls simple questions that deserve answers about the condition of a major presidential candidate, the rumors and the speculation are only going to get worse. Right now, the only completely ludicrous conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton’s health is that there’s nothing wrong with it. In a nutshell, the narrative her team has chosen for her is the only narrative that’s not even remotely supported by the evidence. Something is wrong with Hillary Clinton’s health, and everyone knows it. If Hillary Clinton’s campaign doesn’t want to tell the truth about what’s really happening with her health, the least it could do is come up with some more believable lies. Share this if you demand Hillary answer questions about her failing health. Leave us your comments below on what you think Hillary’s medical records will show."
"It’s Getting Serious Now, Both Candidates’ Health Records Called For",30 AUG 2016,5934,"Both Candidates Were Asked About Their Medical Records Donald Trump issued another challenge to Hillary Clinton. On Twitter, he made a post saying that he and Clinton should release their medical records. The reason for this was because there has been recent speculation that Clinton is in declining health and wouldn’t be a fit choice to be the President of the United States. Trump’s campaign has said that Clinton’s health is worse than what the public sees. He even said that she doesn’t have the physical “stamina” to be the commander in chief. It’s not exactly news that the President takes a lot out of people. If Obama Had Done His Job Right, He Wouldn’t Be Laughing It is among the most stressful jobs in the entire world and stress can have some crazy effects on people. Because of the nature of the job, you want someone who is going to be in good health to take over the Oval Office. Well Clinton seems to have had some interesting encounters with the media. There was one incident where she appeared to have some sort of seizure when asked a question. People in perfect health don’t just start shaking uncontrollably. However if you ask Clinton’s own doctor, Lisa Bardack, she will say this about Clinton. “She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States.” Bardack is the chair of internal medicine at Mount Kisco Medical Group. Naturally anything that the Clinton campaign says is going to be designed to deflect any health questions and continue to say that she is in fine health. However they can’t just ignore the people’s concerns. But they are going to, which might throw off a lot of potential voters. Meanwhile Trump’s original challenge on Twitter was this. “I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?” This was a smart tactic by Trump because people ARE concerned about Clinton’s health. Trump’s Latest Challenge To Clinton! Meanwhile former Republican presidential candidate and now Trump supporter Ben Carson had this to say about the challenge. “You know, as people get older, a lot of things begin to go wrong in their bodies. And I think the American people have a right to know, because we’re dealing with two older candidates, what their health status is because it’s a very intense job. It’s not, you know, eight hours a day. It’s 24/7 with constant stress. We need to know that we have a leader who can withstand that.” You would be foolish not to listen to Carson. He might not have had the political skill necessary to make a good presidential run, but he is a retired world-renowned neurosurgeon. That makes him an expert in the world of medicine and he should be listened to when medical stuff is involved. Trump said that he would have no problem doing that, but what about Clinton? She did release a two-page letter from her doctor that claimed to have a lot of detail involved in it. Other than that an aide told NBC that the campaign would not be releasing any more records. Now that doesn’t seem smart. Clinton Said She Wouldn’t Have Her Records Released The Clinton campaign said that the letter released had more detail compared to trumps. Supposedly it had detailed information like cholesterol levels, medical history and medications. How can you fit that much-detailed information from a 68-year-old woman on two pages? Two pages doesn’t seem like a lot of room to show this detail, especially considering that someone as old as Clinton is bound to have a lot of medication just because it seems like a lot of elderly people take a lot of medicine. Unless the font on the letter was super small, it’s skeptical that all that information was available on two pages ALONG with medical history AND cholesterol levels. People are worried about her health and yet the campaign isn’t going to release any more information. That doesn’t bode well for people who want the full truth. Not to mention that if Clinton’s doctor has said that she is in good condition to serve as President, then she wouldn’t have a problem releasing medical records. Clinton Won’t Release Her Medical Records, Which Won’t Sit Well With Potential Voters Naturally this is going to go against Clinton. After all there was speculation that she was having a special handler to give her medicine when she needed it. Was that addressed in the letter from her doctor? No it wasn’t, and yet this special person kept popping up everywhere. The bottom line is that you want to have a President who is going to be in good health and isn’t going to pass away during their time as Commander in Chief. By Clinton saying that she isn’t going to release any more medical records, the people of the United States have a right to know if a presidential candidate is healthy enough to take over as President. Trump Says He Will Release His Medical Records, But Clinton Won’t. What Is She Hiding? The fact that she isn’t doing so makes it really suspicious to people and those that say “Oh she doesn’t have to” don’t have a clue to what they are talking about. And yes that could possibly be a liberal response. Just actually think about this. Someone who is running for the most stressful job in the world isn’t going to release the medical records, saying that the two page letter from her doctor is sufficient enough. If that doesn’t make you scratch your head, nothing will. People need to spread the message that Trump is willing to release his medical records but the Clinton campaign won’t. They claim that a two-page letter is enough information about her medical history. Two pages is not a lot. Share this article to show people that Clinton doesn’t want to address the voters concern about her medical records. Is that someone you want running the country? If not then go out and vote for Trump on Election Day. If enough people do this then we stand a chance against the Clinton machine."
"SHOCKING: Bill Clinton Just Let It Slip, The Truth About Hillary’s Health",25 AUG 2016,2487,"Bill Gave Away His True Feelings In Klein’s Hit Book The Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seems to think that her health issues are funny. Recently on a show with Jimmy Kimmel she was even cracking jokes. The reality though, is that she has continued to ignore her growing issues. To the general public and news sources, it now appears that she is hiding legitimate health complications. These issues include coughing spells, freezing during speeches, seizures in the middle of interviews, and general weakness when traveling (walking up stairs or getting into vehicles). The mainstream media is currently pushing the idea that her health concerns are nothing more than an attempt by Conservatives to bash her. That theory is completely washed away, however, by the simple fact that her own husband Bill Clinton has talked about the same concerns. If you read passages from Edward Klein’s hit book Unlikeable, The Problem with Hillary Clinton, you will find that even Bill believes his wife is “too ill to run for president.” Just last year, Hillary was forced to cancel meetings and slow down her campaign pace dramatically. She insisted that her doctors couldn’t find any sort of “definitive problem.” However, Klein wrote in his book that “Bill believed she was in denial and was ignoring what could be life-threatening symptoms.” Hillary Being Helped Up Small Steps Earlier This Year Former President Bill Clinton was so worried that he asked a close friend of his and a cardiologist to look over her medical history. After doing so, the doctor recommended that the former Secretary of State either stop immediately, or travel with a licensed physician at all times. He insisted that she remain under “constant supervision.” But as we can all see, Hillary wouldn’t allow it. Klein wasn’t finished though. He said that Bill explicitly stated that his wife “would fall at a critical time during her campaign, and give away the fact that she is truly unfit to be president,” in the realest sense of the word. Unfortunately for Bill, Hillary exploded back at him and told him that he was “acting like a loser and projecting his own health problems onto her.” To everyone else, it’s quite clear that she may be in denial. At the end of the day we want to see her medical records, because she is undoubtedly experiencing a lot of issues at this point in the campaign trail. She can’t deny that even her husband is worried. He, of all people, should now just how sick she is. Source: CT  "
Students Stage Walk Out Protesting Mask Mandate,3 SEP 2021,6045,"In Douglas County, students walked out of school in a protest against idiotic, unconstitutional, and ineffective mask mandates. The Highlands Ranch Herald reported: The walkout started when three students emerged from Legend High School in Parker and meandered toward a nearby park. Two more followed shortly after, and for a moment the small group was the only sign of protest. Then came dozens, and within minutes, hundreds of students and parents had amassed across the street from the high school. They held signs calling masks child abuse, public health officials liars, and demanded masks remain optional. “I can’t do this again,” said one boy’s poster. Multiple student walkouts took place at Douglas County high schools Sept. 1 in protest of a masking mandate for students 2 and older in schools, which went into effect that morning. The Tri-County Health Department on Aug. 30 rescinded the opt-out ability of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties for a previous mask order that applied to children ages 2 through 11, and then expanded the order to include all children over 2. Tri-County Health Executive Director John Douglas said COVID-19 is not making children severely ill in general but the health agency wants to help control the virus’ spread to family and vulnerable people through children. The agency also wants to keep students in in-person learning as case rates are continuing to rise in the metro area, he said. Public health experts including Douglas have spoken at previous school board meetings, stressing there is no evidence masks are harmful to children and that they are effective at containing COVID-19 spread, although those comments were usually rebuffed by anti-masking crowds calling for personal choice. District spokeswoman Paula Hans provided a statement when asked for comment on the Sept. 1 protests. The district is balancing challenges from the ongoing pandemic and will follow Tri-County’s health order, she said, which requires masks for students and staff in preschool through 12th grade. “Additionally, we will work with our families and staff members who cannot tolerate a mask due to medical or mental health reasons. Our goal is to keep our students and staff in the classroom for in-person learning,” her statement said. Douglas County commissioners on Aug. 1 voted to withdraw the county from Tri-County Health and create its own health department. It was not immediately clear what, if any, impact that action would have on mask rules in the Douglas County School District. At Legend, Linda Potter attended in support of her freshman son, Michael Davy. Wearing masks last school year affected his mental and physical health by causing headaches, she said. Potter has an obligation as a parent to help Michael speak up for personal freedoms, she said. “They are very passionate speaking with their own voice and their own constitutional right,” she said of the students. Potter said she would support her son if he wanted to wear a mask, but Michael said that’s not his stance. He does not believe masks are effective and said he noticed less social interaction between students after the mandate began that morning. Michael did not comply, he said, and observed what he estimated to be fewer than 50% of students masking at Legend the morning of Sept. 1. Staff did not reprimand him, but his impression was some teachers were upset by his choice, saying he got “dirty looks.” He hopes the mandate is repealed and said the latest health order angered him. “Because we already went through this for one whole year and I don’t want to do it again,” he said. Zackary Taylor, a 16-year-old junior at Legend, also called masks ineffective and that he does not believe COVID is serious. His family contracted the virus and got through OK, he said, including his grandmother with health challenges. Taylor believes everyone will catch COVID-19 at some point and that masking should be a personal choice. “I do get that there are people who need to wear masks because of family members,” he said. Protests took place at multiple schools in Douglas County on Sept. 1, including Ponderosa High School in Parker and Rock Canyon High School near Highlands Ranch. Bryan McBride is an English teacher at Rock Canyon. In preparing the day before for expected student walkouts, McBride said he planned to support what he called students’ First Amendment right to protest but would remain in the classroom to also support students who wanted to work on that day’s lessons. McBride estimated about 5% of people at Rock Canyon voluntarily masked before mandates went into effect this school year, echoing estimates district Superintendent Corey Wise shared for the whole district at an Aug. 24 board meeting. “In our particular building, I think a lot of us did feel safe because our numbers weren’t going up, even when they we going up in the district. We weren’t seeing many positive cases in the building, so we felt kind of insulated,” McBride said. He supports masking now to prevent Colorado from losing intensive-care unit capacity, like several other states are, and said he’s trusting Tri-County Health’s guidance when it comes to mandates. The start to the school year has been tense, McBride said, and he worries about further spread of the delta variant along with continued disputes over COVID-19. “I think already we are starting to feel tired and normally I don’t think that that’s something we experience in the third week of class,” he said. “It just stinks. I don’t know a better way to put it.” Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found I’m at Legend High School where a student walkout protesting the latest mask mandate is now underway. pic.twitter.com/NZnOcXMb1t — Jessica Gibbs (@JesstheJourno) September 1, 2021 Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found School walkout, Denver, Colorado.

"Media Freak Out, PP Calls For Riots! SCOTUS Upholds Texas Abortion Ban, Roberts Sided Left, But Lost",2 SEP 2021,6231,"The Supreme Court, despite the efforts of Justice Roberts siding with leftists, has upheld Texas’ ban on abortion. The Gateway Pundit explained: The Chairwoman of Arizona’s Planned Parenthood Action chapter, Chris Love called for riots after SCOTUS ignored emergency requests to block the Texas Heartbeat Law. The “heartbeat” law will effectively outlaw abortions in the state after 6 weeks and it also gives any citizen – including those outside Texas – the right to take legal action against anyone who ‘aids and abets’ the termination of a pregnancy after the cut-off point. Love was absolutely triggered that SCOTUS had the gall to prevent unborn babies from being slaughtered. Love: I mean, what exactly did you all expect? You’re devastated, but you consistently ignored every single sign. I’ll write something coherent in the morning, but just know that fighting back doesn’t mean pussy hats or petitions. Be ready to break some shit. If you went to bed early last night, you’re waking up to news that SCOTUS did not to intervene in Texas, so SB8, a bill that bans abortion at 6 weeks, is now law. If you’re like me, your timelines is awash with folks being all varieties of upset as Roe is essentially done.

(602) 277-7526 The radical left is calling for violence because they cannot kill babies with beating hearts. These people are disgusting. Citizen Free Press added some reactions from the enraged media: UPDATE Earlier today, by virtue of SCOTUS not acting, the Texas law automatically went into effect. Now, in the past hour, the Justices have issued their ruling — A 5-4 vote against the emergency request to stay the Texas law. Justice Roberts voted with the Liberal wing to grant the stay. Read the ruling… CBS NEWS BREAKING Washington — The Supreme Court late Wednesday night declined to halt a Texas law banning abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy, allowing the nation’s most restrictive measure to remain in effect. The court ruled 5-4 against providing relief to abortion providers, who asked the Supreme Court on Monday to put the law, which outlaws most abortions in the state, on hold. The high court failed to act before it went into effect early Wednesday, a victory for anti-abortion advocates, and rejected the request from abortion rights supporters to block the law nearly 24 hours later. While the high court refused to stop the law while the legal fight continues, the majority said its decision “is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts.” In the final hours Tuesday before the law took effect, Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four clinics in Texas and is a plaintiff in the case, reported having full waiting rooms of patients seeking abortions. But as of Wednesday, the clinics would only provide the procedures if ultrasounds that do not show cardiac activity in compliance with the law, Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, told reporters. In their request to the court, the groups estimated at least 85% of women who undergo abortions in Texas are at least six weeks pregnant and warned the law prohibits nearly all abortions in the state and will drive many abortion clinics to close. Politico is not pleased… The Supreme Court early Wednesday let a Texas state law take effect that allows private citizens to sue to uphold a ban on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, potentially creating a new template for states to impose strict restrictions on the procedure. The court’s decision to not act on an emergency petition from Texas abortion clinics comes as the justices prepare to more broadly reconsider the right to an abortion it established almost 50 years ago. In May, justices agreed to review Mississippi’s ban on the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy — a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Those arguments are expected later this year, with a ruling in 2022. “This is a de facto overturning of Roe before the Supreme Court has time to hear the Mississippi case,” said Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson. “And Texas will now go back to being a pre-Roe state, turning the clock back 50 years.” Beyond outlawing babykilling as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, the Texas law, signed in May, would deputize citizens to file civil suits against abortion providers or anyone who helps facilitate the procedure after six weeks, such as a person who drives a pregnant person to the clinic. Individuals found to have violated the law would have to pay $10,000 to the person who successfully brings such a suit — a bounty abortion rights advocates warn will encourage harassment, intimidation and vigilantism. Anti-babykilling groups in the state such as Texas Right to Life have in recent weeks set up tip lines for people to anonymously report violators, ahead of the law’s implementation. Earlier on Tuesday, the a federal district court issued a temporary restraining order barring the group from filing suits against a small group of individuals and organizations that assist patients in obtaining an abortion. But both sides of the case acknowledge the order is very narrow, and the anti-abortion group said it still plans to solicit tips and bring lawsuits against abortion providers now that courts have given a green light to the law’s implementation."
Harvard Epidemiologist: Case for COVID Vax Passports Just Got Destroyed!,2 SEP 2021,4594,"People who have taken the mRNA vaccines are at 27 times higher risk of being infected with COVID than those who have developed natural immunities. And, the proof is Israel, where over 85 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated, but hundreds of thousands of people are being re-infected. FEE reported: A newly published medical study found that infection from COVID-19 confers considerably longer-lasting and stronger protection against the Delta variant of the virus than vaccines. “The natural immune protection that develops after a SARS-CoV-2 infection offers considerably more of a shield against the Delta variant of the pandemic coronavirus than two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to a large Israeli study that some scientists wish came with a ‘Don’t try this at home’ label,” the Scientific American reported Thursday. “The newly released data show people who once had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were much less likely than vaccinated people to get Delta, develop symptoms from it, or become hospitalized with serious COVID-19.” Put another way, vaccinated individuals were 27 times more likely to get a symptomatic COVID infection than those with natural immunity from COVID. A Death Blow to Vaccine Passports? The findings come as many governments around the world are demanding citizens acquire “vaccine passports” to travel. New York City, France, and the Canadian provinces of Quebec and British Columbia are among those who have recently embraced vaccine passports. Meanwhile, Australia has floated the idea of making higher vaccination rates a condition of lifting its lockdown in jurisdictions, while President Joe Biden is considering making interstate travel unlawful for people who have not been vaccinated for COVID-19. Vaccine passports are morally dubious for many reasons, not the least of which is that freedom of movement is a basic human right. However, vaccine passports become even more senseless in light of the new findings out of Israel and revelations from the CDC, some say. Harvard Medical School professor Martin Kulldorff said research showing that natural immunity offers exponentially more protection than vaccines means vaccine passports are both unscientific and discriminatory, since they disproportionately affect working class individuals. “Prior COVID disease (many working class) provides better immunity than vaccines (many professionals), so vaccine mandates are not only scientific nonsense, they are also discriminatory and unethical,” Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist, observed on Twitter. Nor is the study out of Israel a one-off. Media reports show that no fewer than 15 academic studies have found that natural immunity offers immense protection from COVID-19. Moreover, CDC research shows that vaccinated individuals still get infected with COVID-19 and carry just as much of the virus in their throat and nasal passage as unvaccinated individuals “High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,” CDC Rochelle Director Walensky noted following a Cape Cod outbreak that included mostly vaccinated individuals. These data suggest that vaccinated individuals are still spreading the virus much like unvaccinated individuals. The Bottom Line Vaccine passports would be immoral and a massive government overreach even in the absence of these findings. There is simply no historical parallel for governments attempting to restrict the movements of healthy people over a respiratory virus in this manner. Yet the justification for vaccine passports becomes not just wrong but absurd in light of these new revelations. People who have had COVID already have significantly more protection from the virus than people who’ve been vaccinated. Meanwhile, people who’ve not had COVID and choose to not get vaccinated may or may not be making an unwise decision. But if they are, they are principally putting only themselves at risk. In Israel, vaccinated individuals had 27 times higher risk of symptomatic COVID infection compared to those with natural immunity from prior COVID disease [95%CI:13-57, adjusted for time of vaccine/disease]. No COVID deaths in either group.https://t.co/hopImCD1D0 — Martin Kulldorff (@MartinKulldorff) August 25, 2021 Israel now leads the world in the seven-day rolling average of new daily #COVID19 cases per capita, overtaking Montenegro and Georgia, according to the Oxford University-based Our World in Data. — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) August 31, 2021"
Former DOJ Official Indicted for Extortion Plot Against Matt Gaetz,1 SEP 2021,10796,"Matt Gaetz has been proved telling the truth and the evil, corrupt former DOJ official who tried to extort him has been indicted. The Gateway Pundit explained: As The Gateway Pundit reported on Tuesday — The New York Times published a hit piece targeting popular Trump-supporter Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) saying the Florida Congressman was under investigation for dating a 17-year-old girl. The Gateway Pundit later spoke with a source close to Matt Gaetz who told us this report is completely false. Gaetz is not the target of the investigation. We were also told none of the women he was seeing were underage. It’s not a surprise the left is after Gaetz since he is such an effective communicator and a staunch Trump supporter. Rep. Gaetz told Axios “the allegations were as searing as they are false.” On Tuesday night Rep. Matt Gaetz joined Tucker Carlson to discuss the New York Times hit piece. Matt Gaetz UNLOADED on a former Justice Department official who was threatening his family and accused one of his. Rep. Matt Gaetz: What is happening is extortion of me and my family involving a former Department of Justice official. On March 16th, my father got a text message demanding a meeting wherein a person demanded $25 million in exchange for making horrible sex trafficking allegations of me go away. Our family was so troubled by that we went to the local FBI and the FBI and the Department of Justice were so concerned about this, that they asked my dad to wear a wire. Which he did with the former Department of Justice official. Tonight I am demanding that the Department of Justice and the FBI release the audio recordings that were made under their supervision and at their direction which will prove my innocence. These allegations aren’t true and they were meant to bleed my family. This former Department of Justice official tomorrow was supposed to be contacted by my father so that specific instructions could be given regarding the wiring of $4.5 million as a down payment on this bribe. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that tonight somehow The New York Times is leaking this information, smearing me, and ruining the investigation. Tucker Carlson: …First of all, who is this Department of Justice former employee who is trying to extort the money from you. Rep. Gaetz: His name is David McGee… He currently works at the Beggs and Lane law firm. The Gateway Pundit wrote Attorney David McGee on Tuesday regarding Rep. Gaetz’s accusations.
We did not hear back from McGee. Later Rep. Gaetz’s office sent The Gateway Pundit this statement. “Over the past several weeks my family and I have been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name. We have been cooperating with federal authorities in this matter and my father has even been wearing a wire at the FBI’s direction to catch these criminals. The planted leak to the New York Times tonight was intended to thwart that investigation. No part of the allegations against me are true, and the people pushing these lies are targets of the ongoing extortion investigation. I demand the DOJ immediately release the tapes, made at their direction, which implicate their former colleague in crimes against me based on false allegations.” -Rep. Matt Gaetz Matt Gaetz was right. On Tuesday federal prosecutors accused Stephen Alford of trying to defraud US Rep. Matt Gaetz’s father Don Gaetz out of $25 million. Reuters reported: Federal prosecutors on Tuesday accused a Florida man of trying to defraud U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz’s father Don Gaetz out of $25 million, in a scheme allegedly linked to a criminal investigation targeting the Republican congressman. In a newly unsealed indictment, prosecutors accused Stephen Alford, 62, of contacting Gaetz’s father and demanding $25 million. The congressman is currently under criminal investigation over an allegation that he sex trafficked a minor and, prosecutors alleged that Alford falsely claimed he could help Gaetz obtain a pardon from former President Donald Trump. The indictment does not refer directly to the embattled pro-Trump lawmaker or his father, a former healthcare executive who also served as president of Florida’s state senate. But the alleged plot was widely reported this year after Gaetz released documents he said showed an extortion plot against him. Politico added: Stephen Alford, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., is accused in a plan that offered to shut down a high-profile, criminal sex-trafficking investigation into the lawmaker. A Florida developer and fraud convict was arrested Tuesday on a charge that he tried to extort $25 million from the father of Rep. Matt Gaetz in exchange for a presidential pardon that would shut down a high-profile, criminal sex-trafficking investigation into the Republican congressman. Stephen Alford, 62, of Fort Walton Beach, was indicted on charges of wire fraud and destruction of property subject to a seizure warrant. The indictment alleges that in March and April of this year, Alford attempted to get Gaetz’s wealthy father, Don, to pay the large sum as part of a complex deal dubbed “Project Homecoming.” The scheme Alford promoted would also have funded a private effort to rescue a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007, Robert Levinson. U.S. officials said last year they believe Levinson was arrested and later died in Iranian custody, but Iran has publicly denied arresting Levinson. His body has never been found. According to the indictment, Alford said he could “guarantee” that one of Don Gaetz’s family members would not go to prison if the money Alford demanded was paid. Don Gaetz told POLITICO in March that he wore a wire at the FBI’s request. Many of the quotes and details in the indictment appear to come from the discussions he recorded. The indictment refers to Don Gaetz, a former Florida state Senate leader, as “D.G.” and describes the investigation to be extinguished as one “by the FBI for various public corruption and public integrity issues.” The indictment lists three other anonymous people. “Family Member A” is Matt Gaetz. “Person A,” who first reached out to Don Gaetz to discuss the scheme via text message, is a former U.S. Air Force Intelligence officer named Bob Kent, whom the Gaetz family identified in a March interview with POLITICO and who later discussed his role in the matter with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, where Kent denied wrongdoing. Kent said that McGee introduced him to Alford, who had been the lawyer’s client in the past. (Alford is currently on probation for an unrelated land-fraud crime.) “When Dave vouched for Stephen, that was good enough for me. I‘ve worked with Dave for a long time,“ Kent told CNN in April. The third person, “Attorney A,” is former federal prosecutor David McGee, the Gaetzes alleged. He has represented the Levinson family’s interests. McGee has previously denied wrongdoing or knowledge of the scheme. In a written statement, Matt Gaetz spokesperson Harlan Hill bashed the “baseless allegations about him” and connected them to what he calls Alford’s “extortion attempt.” Hill, pointing to the indictment, said Alford “wasn’t acting alone.” “The release of the Alford tapes will further exculpate Rep. Gaetz and implicate those with long-standing links to the federal government,” Hill said. Jeffrey Neiman, an attorney for Don Gaetz, wouldn’t comment on the connection between the alleged shakedown and the sex crimes investigation of Matt Gaetz, nor would he say whether anyone else outside of Alford should be charged with a crime. “Don came forward with credible information that he was the victim of an extortion plot. After careful consideration and verification, the Justice Department has now acted on that information,” Neiman said. “Don remains cooperative with the Justice Department. And he hopes that all of those responsible for this fraudulent act are held accountable.” The alleged shakedown scheme occurred as word spread through Gaetz’s northwest Florida district that he was under investigation in the sex-trafficking a 17-year-old, a crime he has denied. The allegations against Gaetz were spread by Joel Greenberg, the congressman’s onetime friend and a former Seminole County tax collector, who pleaded guilty for sex trafficking the minor, for falsely smearing a political foe as a pedophile and for a host of other crimes. To get a lighter sentence, Greenberg is cooperating with federal authorities in their investigation of Gaetz. He is awaiting sentencing. No charges against Gaetz have been filed, although investigators have interviewed many of his associates, including past girlfriends. The investigation appears to have slowed down as federal prosecutors negotiate with a former girlfriend of Gaetz‘s who wants an immunity deal in return for whatever testimony she might give. Gaetz, who has called the investigation a “Deep State” witch hunt, has said the shakedown scheme was proof that the Justice Department investigation into him is politically motivated. It is unclear how, why or whether Alford thought he could get President Joe Biden to issue a pardon to Gaetz, a populist Republican lawmaker and prominent backer of President Donald Trump. Alford reportedly indicated that he had ties to people at the Justice Department who could facilitate the Biden pardon for Gaetz. In his April CNN interview, Kent acknowledged sending a text to Don Gaetz that talked about the “current federal investigation [into Matt Gaetz], and the indictment that is about to be filed against your son. I have a plan that can make his future legal and political problems go away.“ Kent explained to CNN that he had made similar offers to other people. “We’ve worked with multiple people over the — over the years. And all of them have been in similar situations,” Kent said. “I mean, a lot of them have been facing indictments or all looking for goodwill from the U.S. government.” Kent could not be reached for comment about Tuesday’s developments. The new indictment handed up by a grand jury in Pensacola alleges that the $25 million demand from Alford eventually decreased to $15.5 million. The sum was supposed to be paid through the trust account of a law firm, the indictment says, without identifying the firm. Alford has previously been convicted of federal fraud charges and faced a state fraud case in 2015. Federal prosecutors said in a press release that he appeared in federal court Tuesday on the new charges and is currently in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.

“We’ve Had Enough!” Truckers Stand Against Vax Mandates: Australia Shut Down As US Planned Today,31 AUG 2021,4151,"People are fed up with the lies and attempts to enslave them… and truckers are actually doing something about it. The Gateway Pundit explained: Tomorrow, Truckers across the United States will stop driving their trucks for at least one day to fight against vaccine mandates.  Canceled Tik Tok creator, @thedisrespectedtrucker3 and other social media users have organized a nationwide trucker strike. The Trucker and CDL Life that a protest against mandatory vaccines was planned for truckers across the United States. On Thursday, CLD Life reported: A trucker-founded anti-vaccine mandate protest is seemingly in the works for the end of this month according to several trucker social media groups. If carried out, the demonstration will be an alliance between healthcare workers, truckers, military members, and other citizens across the country, and will protest the requirement of the COVID-19 vaccine for employment, travel, and more. The demonstrators, seemingly headed by Tik Tok trucker @thedisrespectedtrucker3, will gather at various locations across the country August 31st – the same day that the Australian trucker protest against COVID lockdown and restrictions is being held. In addition to the nearly-viral Tik Tok videos put out by @disrespectedtrucker3, the Facebook Group StopTheTires2020, a group that attempted to organize a nationwide demonstration against the election results and COVID19 lockdowns just last year, has gotten wind of the potential strike and is calling for all drivers to stop their trucks for just one day. “When I say it’s not about the trucking industry, it’s not about the trucking industry,” disrespected trucker says. “We just have the power to shut the country down.” “On August 31st, on Tuesday, we’re asking that everybody not go to work,” disrespected trucker explained.  “If they’re out on the road, shut your truck down. There are guys that plan on putting their trucks across the road. There’s guys who plan on parking on the side of the road, parking at home, and at truck stops.” “I’m not telling anyone how to do it or what to do,” he continued. “I’m just telling people to shut your trucks down, and nobody go to work at least for Tuesday. Maybe for the rest of the week. Until we get their attention in DC, we’re going to have to keep putting up with bulls**t mandates. What’s going on with the nurses and the military right now isn’t right. So, we’re going to stand up for Freedom.” On Friday, The Disrespected Trucker tweeted a video of him putting his money where his mouth is. Well, I guess it’s time for me to put up, or shut up, right? This truck is shut down officially. I’ll see you guys in St. Paul tomorrow, at the capitol. I will be getting back in the truck to drive it up there to help stand with you healthcare workers at the capitol. Other than that, this truck ain’t movin. 8-31-21

Today, he announced that he was removed from Tik Tok and that we are in deep trouble if we do not stand up to censorship. Censorship is real folks. I just got banned off of Tik Tok for absolutely nothing, I didn’t threaten anybody, I didn’t bully anybody. I didn’t promote violence, but they banned me anyway. You know why that is? Because I got 85,000 followers in less than a week, because I speak the truth. It’s sad what this country is coming to. And if we don’t all start standing up against this, we’re in deep trouble, just so you know. Anyway, I guess I’ll be on here a little bit more until they ban me off of here which I’m sure is coming very shortly. Have a good day. pic.twitter.com/Xh0LIckTHj — The Disrespected Trucker (@DisrespectedThe) August 30, 2021 A source tells The Gateway Pundit that this is legitimate, but it may not be implemented in a uniform manner.

Fighting Lockdowns And Useless Mask Mandates: Biden DHS Says You’re “Potential Terrorist”,16 AUG 2021,2599,"In addition to having conservative views, now people who disagree with the vaccine mandates and useless masks (according to the Biden regime’s DHS) are now “potential terrorists.” Breitbart News reported: United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has labeled opponents to coronavirus measures as “potential terror threats,” according to an NBC News screen capture reported by Jack Posobiec on Saturday. “Potential Terror Threats,” NBC News captioned the graphic, citing the DHS. Underneath the headline “terror threats” are listed as those who are opposed to “COVID Measures,” believe “Trump can be reinstated,” and “9/11 Anniversary and Religious Holidays.” ABC News reported: DHS’ National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin issued on Friday, warned that threats from domestic terrorists — individuals engaged in grievance-based violence — and foreign terrorists are exacerbated by the pandemic, “including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions.” The DHS’s labeling of those who oppose coronavirus measures, which could include lockdowns, mask mandates, and forced vaccinations, comes after the nation experienced protests in show of their opposition to governments and businesses encroaching on individual rights and duties. Parent Keri Blare from Collierville School District in Tennessee told WREG in Memphis that she is protesting the school system’s mask mandate. “We want to have our own right and have our own decision to decide to wear a mask or not,” she explained. “That’s why I’m here today and that’s the right that I have to make that for my child as a recommendation.” Registered nurse Crystal Real stated in Kentucky that “none of us want to lose our job…the reason I came out here, is because, well, I’ve been a nurse for 13 years, and I’ve never taken a vaccine,” she said in protest of a local hospital’s vaccination mandate. CT technologist at PeaceHealth St. John Tammy Harris told KTPV Fox 12 in Washington State that he is healthy and should not have to undergo the the hospital’s mandates. “I’m a healthy individual and they need to prove I pose a danger to my patients. I believe I can survive it and if I can’t, I am willing to take the risk. I’m willing to take the end result, which could be death,” he stated about the hospital’s forced vaccination protocols. “HAPPENING NOW: Thousands of citizens are out rallying at the Washington State Capitol in protest of @GovInslee’s forced vaccination mandate,” tweeted Katie Daviscourt regarding Gov. Jay Inslee’s (D) forced vaccine mandate, set to take effect August 31."
CDC Forced To ‘Fix Error’ After Being Caught Inflating Florida COVID Numbers,12 AUG 2021,2030,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been busted lying again… and are being forced to ‘correct’ inflated numbers of COVID cases in Florida. Fox News ‘reported’: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday updated its COVID-19 tracker for Florida over the past few days after the state’s department of health appealed publically for an update.  The CDC told Fox News in an email on Tuesday that it was working with the state’s health department to correct the information. The state took to Twitter on Monday to ask the CDC to update its COVID-19 case tracker because it incorrectly combined “MULTIPLE days into one.” The Sunday total was the state’s worst ever, according to the CDC data. Multiple media organizations picked up on the number and the department corrected the stories online with some bite. “Wrong again. The number of cases @CDCgov released for Florida today is incorrect,” it responded to a report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. “They combined MULTIPLE days into one. We anticipate CDC will correct the record.” The CDC initially reported 28,317 new cases on Sunday but adjusted that number to 19,584 by Tuesday. The health department said there were 15,319 cases on Sunday. The CDC and the state did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News about the discrepancy. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the state has surpassed 20,000 for its 7-day average of new cases, a day after the federal agency misreported numbers given by the Florida Department of Health by combining data from the last three days into two. Hospitalizations rose by more than 1,100 on Tuesday to 14,787 patients with COVID-19, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. More than 47% of ICU beds were taken by about 3,000 coronavirus patients. That number has nearly tripled in the last three weeks. At no other time during the pandemic have intensive care units seen a percentage of COVID patients as high as in the last two days."
"“We Will Find You!” The Anger Is Real For Tennessee Parents, Board Meeting Erupts",12 AUG 2021,2063,"Tennesseans are fighters. That’s how the state got its “volunteer” name. Last night, in one of the wealthiest areas of Tennessee, furious parents erupted against the school board and leftist doctors who claimed that masks were necessary (despite ALL scientific evidence) in public schools. Conservative Treehouse reported: Things got ugly in Williamson County, Tennessee, as the school board defied the parents and required students to wear masks this school year.  The debate inside the board meeting was very heated as the board members decided to force the students to wear masks regardless of what the parents wanted. The four-hour school board meeting drew a large crowd of freedom protesters including former sports journalist and conservative political commentator Clay Travis, who has children that attend schools in the district.  Local news report. Apparently, the dancing Tik-Tok and Healthcare workers union showed up to advocate for forced masks and said any of the parents who were not compliant were trying to endanger the children.  The factions within Tennessee became clear quickly as the totalitarians started shutting down the voices of the parents in opposition to their social control plan. Things really got ugly when Joe Biden’s coalition of supporters and condescending Tik-Tok healthcare workers left the building and were surrounded by angry parents. It befuddles me how wearing a mask (or not) is not just a decision left up to the individual parents, teachers and employees within the school.  If a parent wants to mask their child they should, if a parent doesn’t – that should be an option also.  Same for teachers and everyone else.  Why can’t these school boards leave it up to the individual?

Scientific Data: mRNA Vaccine “Worse Than Disease” As 100 Vaxxed Dead In Mass,11 AUG 2021,3345,"In Massachusetts, 100 people who were vaccinated have died. Of course, the propaganda media is claiming these numbers are ‘low,’ but a new study published in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, Research shows that the mRNA vaccines cause serious complications and can be worse than the disease itself. Boston.com reported: The 100 deaths represent a tiny fraction — about 0.002 percent — of all fully vaccinated individuals in the state. BOSTON (AP) — One hundred people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus died from the disease in Massachusetts by the end of July, according to the state Department of Public Health. In about three-quarter of the breakthrough cases, the patients reported having underlying conditions, the department said. The median age of those who died was 82.5 years. The deaths represent a tiny fraction — about 0.002 percent — of all fully vaccinated individuals in the state, according to state health officials. “Breakthrough cases in Massachusetts are incredibly low, and those hospitalized or who have died are even lower,” department officials said in a written statement. “All available data continue to support that all three vaccines used in the US are highly protective against severe disease and death from all known variants of COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is to get vaccinated,” the statement added. The department also reported 395 breakthrough hospitalizations in the state. The IJVTPR stated: ABSTRACT Operation Warp Speed brought to market in the United States two mRNA vaccines, produced by Pfizer and Moderna. Interim data suggested high efficacy for both of these vaccines, which helped legitimize Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA. However, the exceptionally rapid movement of these vaccines through controlled trials and into mass deployment raises multiple safety concerns. In this review we first describe the technology underlying these vaccines in detail. We then review both components of and the intended biological response to these vaccines, including production of the spike protein itself, and their potential relationship to a wide range of both acute and long-term induced pathologies, such as blood disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. Among these potential induced pathologies, we discuss the relevance of prion-protein-related amino acid sequences within the spike protein. We also present a brief review of studies supporting the potential for spike protein “shedding”, transmission of the protein from a vaccinated to an unvaccinated person, resulting in symptoms induced in the latter.We finish by addressing a common point of debate, namely, whether or not these vaccines could modify the DNA of those receiving the vaccination. While there are no studies demonstrating definitively that this is happening, we provide a plausible scenario, supported by previously established pathways for transformation and transport of genetic material, whereby injected mRNA could ultimately be incorporated into germ cell DNA for transgenerational transmission. We conclude with our recommendations regarding surveillance that will help to clarify the long-term effects of these experimental drugs and allow us to better assess the true risk/benefit ratio of these novel technologies. …"
Biden Regime DHS Secretary Facing Impeachment Charges,11 AUG 2021,5286,"Impeachment articles have been filed against the DHS secretary of the Biden regime. Breitbart News reported: Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) has filed articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for presiding “over a reckless abandonment of border security and immigration enforcement” as the head of the agency. On Tuesday, Biggs filed the articles of impeachment, accusing Mayorkas of being “a threat to the sovereignty and security of our nation” by putting the United States “more in danger today than when he began serving as Secretary” in a statement. In article one of the impeachment, Biggs alleges that Mayorkas is violating his oath by “failing to maintain operational control of the border and releasing hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens into the interior of the United States.” “Secretary Mayorkas has willfully refused to maintain operational control of the border as required by the Secure Fence Act of 2006,” Biggs continues in article one: Secretary Mayorkas has willfully violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by releasing illegal aliens into the interior of the United States despite the plain language of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain inadmissible aliens arriving into the United States or aliens who are present in the United States without inspection while such aliens are processed under expedited removal or placed in removal proceedings. The Secretary of Homeland Security does not have the option of simply releasing those aliens into the interior of the United States. [Emphasis added] Secretary Mayorkas reinstituted the catch and release policies of the Obama administration and has even released inadmissible aliens into the interior of the United States without issuing the aliens notices to appear for immigration proceedings. He is relying on the aliens to report on their own volition to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices to be placed into removal proceedings, a practice that violates the law and defies logic and common sense. Department of Homeland Security data show that over 80 percent of these released illegal aliens are failing to report to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. [Emphasis added] On May 13, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas admitted during testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was releasing inadmissible aliens, whom the Department of Homeland Security is required to detain, into the interior of the United States. This was an admission that under his direction, the Department of Homeland Security is violating the law. [Emphasis added] In article two of the impeachment, Biggs writes that Mayorkas has “placed departmental personnel and American citizens at risk of exposure to and contracting COVID-19, by refusing to take necessary steps to prevent potentially contagious illegal aliens from entering the United States.” “Instead of detaining aliens as required by law, under Secretary Mayorkas’s direction, the Department of Homeland Security has released and transported hundreds of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States without properly screening the aliens for COVID-19 to ensure that the aliens would not spread COVID-19,” Biggs writes: In many other cases, aliens known by the Department of Homeland Security to have COVID-19 were released into the interior of the United States. These actions have subjected the American people to unnecessary and avoidable risks and have strained border communities’ limited health services and resources. [Emphasis added] Read the full articles of impeachment here: Biggs to Mayorkas by John Binder Since President Joe Biden took office, illegal immigration to the U.S. has skyrocketed — coinciding with his canceling of border wall construction, ending the “Remain in Mexico” program, eliminating cooperative asylum agreements with Central America, and restarting of Catch and Release policies. Analysis last month projects that as a result of Biden’s lax enforcement of federal immigration law, nearly 1.7 million illegal aliens are expected to be encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border by the end of 2021. This does not include the hundreds of thousands who will successfully cross into the U.S., undetected by federal immigration officials. Much of the enticement for migrants arriving to the souther border from around the world is the administration’s running of an expansive Catch and Release operation where border crossers and illegal aliens are regularly released into the U.S. interior. Last week, DHS officials admitted in a court brief that coronavirus-positive border crossers arriving at the southern border have “increased significantly” in recent months and caused “extremely worrisome” conditions at detention facilities that are far beyond capacity limits. The latest data reveals that the Biden administration has released about 173,000 border crossers into the U.S. interior since he took office in late January. In addition, just in the month of July, nearly 15,000 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) were released to sponsors across the U.S. Another 16,000 UACs remain in federal custody until they are released to sponsors.  "

"Secret Briefing Report Revealed, 20 Percent of ‘Migrants’ Test Positive, Then Released",9 AUG 2021,2986,"New information shows that the Biden regime is deliberately releasing infected illegals into the U.S. Breitbart News explained: A leaked presidential briefing document reported on by NBC News revealed that 20 percent of unaccompanied migrant children who illegally crossed the border are testing positive for COVID-19 after being released into communities by Border Patrol. The report covers the last two to three weeks of data prepared for President Joe Biden, NBC says. A presidential briefing document reported by NBC News also states that 18 percent of migrant families are testing positive for the pandemic virus after they are released by Border Patrol officials into border communities. President Biden is expected to receive the briefing on Thursday. The report also says that the infection rate of migrant families is impacting the Biden administration’s efforts to deport migrant families under recently reenacted expedited removal processes. Some of the ICE deportation flights had a 25 percent COVID-positive rate among the migrant families scheduled for removal, NBC stated. Those families were removed from the flights for quarantine. “Migrants are not tested for Covid in Border Patrol custody unless they show symptoms, but all are tested when they leave Border Patrol custody, according to DHS officials,” NBC reported. “Immigrants who are allowed to stay in the U.S. to claim asylum are given tests when they are transferred to ICE, Health and Human Services or non-governmental organizations.” On Saturday, Breitbart Texas’ Randy Clark reported images from McAllen, Texas, hotels and motels that are serving as shelter overflows for Catholic Charities operations in that region of the Texas border with Mexico. The photos show healthcare workers going room to room to check the health status of migrants recently released from Border Patrol’s custody. “The migrants could be seen being led by health care workers in smocks escorting them into the hotel lobbies and going door to door with clipboards to speak to those staying in the rooms,” Clark observed. NBC states that healthcare support in Border Patrol shelters is nearly non-existent with only three EMTs on hand to take care of 3,000 migrants. A White House spokesperson issued a statement that reads: DHS and CBP takes its responsibility to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and other diseases very seriously. CBP provides migrants who can’t be expelled…or are awaiting processing with PPE from the moment they are taken into custody, and migrants are required to keep masks on at all times, including when they are transferred or in the process of being released. If anyone exhibits signs of illness in CBP custody, they are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, isolation and treatment. NBC reports that Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 200,000 migrants in July. The official numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to be released later this week."
"Bombshell Report: Fiji Had ZERO COVID Cases, Started Vaccination, Now Tens Of Thousands",9 AUG 2021,5518,"The nation of Fiji had zero cases of COVID… that is until they started ‘vaccinating’ the population. Look at the numbers as explained by World o Meters and Western Pacific: As the morning light settled over Nadi Town on 10 March 2021, Fiji’s frontline team, who have been leading efforts to keep COVID-19 contained in the country, waited anxiously for the first distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Only 3 days prior, Fiji welcomed its highly anticipated first batch of COVID-19 vaccines, supplied through the global COVAX facility – an initiative set up to facilitate the equitable distribution of safe COVID-19 vaccines to all countries, as rapidly as possible. These vaccines play a key role in Fiji’s response to the global pandemic, in addition to continuing with other public health measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. Dr Ratu Mara Vukivukiseru is the first person in Fiji to receive the vaccination. As a consultant anesthetist and COVID-19 clinical lead in Fiji’s Western Division, Dr Ratu Mara has been at the forefront of the country’s response, treating COVID-19 patients in isolation wards and is one of the country’s frontline health care heroes. Nine others were vaccinated at the vaccination rollout event including other frontline health care workers, airport staff, hoteliers and border police. Police Superintendent Kafoa has been working with the Fiji Police Force for 27 years. However, in 2020 his job became very different. Stationed at Nadi International Airport, Superintendent Kafoa is one of the first people to receive incoming travelers to Fiji, guiding them through the country’s rigorous safety processes to quarantine. Superintendent Kafoa’s wife and daughter both work for Fiji Airways, and life hasn’t been easy for them over the past year. With strict border quarantine protocols, the 3 have struggled to look after his 90-year-old grandma who has needed constant care. Today, Superintendent Kafoa also became one of the first people in Fiji to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. “I know that vaccines will not change how we operate just yet, but we are very happy because this offers an extra layer of protection for our job, and we hope that when we vaccinate most of the population, my family will also be protected.” THE VACCINATORS Nurse Ali Tasmin is one of the many nurses who is administering Fiji’s COVID-19 vaccines. “I am very proud to be a part of this amazing team. We’ve been waiting for this day for a long time and I will do my best to protect the people of Fiji with this vaccine.” By the end of Day 1, Nurse Tasmin had vaccinated over 100 people. The Friday prior to the arrival of the vaccines, Nurse Tasmin participated in critical health care workers’ training in administering the vaccine, delivered by the Fiji Ministry of Health and Medical services and supported by technical experts from WHO and UNICEF. MAKING SURE THE OPERATION GOES WELL Dr Rachel Devi is the Head of Fiji’s COVID-19 Vaccine Taskforce and over the past months has been working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure Fiji is well prepared and ready to receive and safely deliver these vaccines. On this day she works closely alongside her team, diligently ensuring all final checks are done for the vaccination sites set up throughout the division. “We have set up almost 20 sites today in the Western Division of Fiji for this first batch of vaccine. We will be going around today to see how it’s going at different sites, making sure the teams are set up properly and things are going smoothly.” After inspecting the airport vaccination site, Dr Rachel leads her team one hour east to the town of Sigatoka to inspect the ongoing vaccination at the Sigatoka hospital, where 287 health care providers are scheduled to get vaccinated in the coming days. At the vaccination sites, doctors and nurses will first explain to patients the common symptoms they may experience after the vaccination and answer any questions they may have about the vaccine. Patients will also be given a vaccination card where the date for their planned second dose of vaccine is given so it’s easy for them to remember. Medical teams who have been trained at Sigatoka Hospital were also sent out to nearby resorts, that host quarantine guests, to establish vaccination sites. These teams usually consist of a doctor, two nurses and data entry personnel. At one of the hotels, Dr Elizabeth Dass lead her team to set up an observation room next door to the vaccination site, where vaccinated individuals are asked to rest and are closely monitored for 15 minutes to ensure they experience no adverse side-effects. Ensuring the safety for all persons vaccinated is at the forefront of these operations, and resources and equipment are onsite to respond. The first day of the vaccination was launched at the airport by Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete, Minister of Health and Medical Services of Fiji, Dr Akeem Ali, Acting WHO Representative for the South Pacific, WHO technical officer Dr Wendy Snowdon and UNICEF Pacific Representative Sheldon Yett. All expressed gratitude towards the COVAX facility and the development partners, including the governments of Australia, New Zealand, UK, as well as the European Union and USAID. At the launch, WHO called for the media of Fiji to continue to support accurate and timely information on COVID-19 vaccines, stressed the importance of continuing to abide by public health measures and protocols that are already in place, and staying vigilant to keep Fiji safe.  "
"Here’s What The Vaccine “Spike Protein” Does To Your Body… It’s Very, Very Bad",9 AUG 2021,6391,"Dr. Ryan Cole has created a video that every single person in the world should see. Conservative Treehouse explained: Before getting to the sketchy part; first, let’s talk…. There has been a great deal of discussion about the vitriolic, almost rabid disposition of people who are pushing the vaccination. This should not be a surprise, although it might be disconcerting to find formerly reasonable people in your network, perhaps even in your family, now become seemingly unhinged if the subject arises. It is demonstrably true, there has been a cleaving of our American population as the debate about the COVID vaccination rages on.  However, it is wise to consider the underlying psychology of a person who has been vaccinated, before engaging in an argument.  You may end up being entirely correct in your position; however, an intense or combative argument? At what cost? A vaccinated person is, as a consequence of their decision, in an irreversible frame of mind.  Once the vaccination has been injected into a persons body, there is no turning back; the Rubicon has been crossed, the event horizon closes, there is no retreat.  Any conversation or debate about vaccine efficacy or long-term consequences with a person who has accepted the vaccine must be weighed accordingly. Genuine empathetic listening is needed on both sides. The no-retreat baseline can, often does, form the origin of anger and vitriol, particularly in unstable leftists -who are, by nature of their ideology- professional blame-casters and prone to emotional responses as a matter of disposition.  Therefore, it is better to avoid the topic entirely (if possible) and retain your peace of mind. ♦ Revelations over the past few years have led to the complete collapse of credibility for many institutions.  The healthcare field is the latest example of a politically controlled ideological industry that can no longer be trusted to make decisions based on a detachment from their political interests. The healthcare industry has joined the education system, the justice system (DOJ), law enforcement (FBI), the intelligence system, arts and entertainment, as well as many organizations now controlled through the prism of politics.  Political ideology, as the determining factor of institutional behavior, has infected almost every facet of modern life; healthcare is no exception. Given the nature of the metastatic corruption, very visible in multiple institutions, it is completely understandable that more people would not trust the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory body or agency now vested in the COVID vaccine. Factually, as previously stated, the FDA final approval of the vaccines is a moot point.  The FDA, just like a vaccinated person, is in a no retreat position.  There is no way the U.S. FDA cannot approve the vaccines that have been sold, forced and pushed upon the entire global population.  Can you even begin to imagine the ramifications of the FDA saying the vaccine was (a) unsafe; or (b) ineffective?    Think about it.  FDA approval is a foregone conclusion, regardless of safety or efficacy. There is every reason not to trust the healthcare industry on the issue of vaccination(s).  Indeed, their obtuse behavior, logical disconnect, false assertions and gross hypocrisy is more than enough to create doubt about the vaccine.  Then overlay the lack of consequence for all known institutional corruption, and there’s even more reason to doubt them. ♦ Two key issues stick in my mind about the COVID vaccines that make me pretty firm in opposition: (1) The fact that vaccine makers would abandon the clinical trial control group is a big red flag.  The fact that vaccine makers could not abandon the clinical trial control group without authorization from the FDA, CDC and NIH is an even bigger red flag.  {Go Deep} The clinical trial was assembled to produce only one result.  THAT is not science.  THAT is sketchy and points to an ulterior motive.  That is not science, that’s political science. (2) The fact that data shows the vaccine provides no benefit is another big red flag.  Specifically, the equal hospitalization rate of vaxxed and non-vaxxed patients.   Almost every study I can find with data on COVID hospitalized cases that includes the vaccination status (not many), shows an equal percentage of vaccinated/hospitalized people to the vaccinated population in general. {Go Deep} [ex. If 75% of the regional population is vaccinated, then 75% of the hospitalized COVID patients are vaccinated.]  This statistic demonstrates the vaccine doesn’t stop serious illness. Put both of those issues together, and overlay the demonstrably collapsed institutional credibility, and I am not comfortable with this specific vaccine. I am not anti-VAX, I am not comfortable with THIS specific vaccination.  And, again, once administered there is no retreat. We should all cherish, respect and value the differences of opinion of this very personal issue.  Healthcare is a personal and private matter.  Other people have different factors, risk-factors and hundreds of considerations that guide or have guided their decision. We should all respect that; and we do not want to see ‘vaccination status‘ become a fragmentation problem for our CTH community.  We are all in the same foxhole. ♦ALL OF THAT said, Dr. Ryan Cole is a Mayo-trained physician who has seen over 350,000 patients in his career. He also serves as the CEO of Cole Diagnostics, which has processed over 100,000 Coronavirus tests.  Dr. Cole gave an alarming presentation that merits consideration: In response to criticism for his position, Dr. Cole wrote: “I am concerned about the lack of long term safety data, because this vaccine is simply too new. We have never tried an mRNA vaccine in humans before. I am concerned about the implications of injection of foreign, synthetic mRNA and the antibody reaction which cannot be reversed. It concerns me that large numbers of individuals are being essentially enrolled in a long term phase III clinical trial for the vaccine without being fully informed of this, with no ability for recompense if injured or in case of death. I am concerned by the number of adverse event and deaths that have been reported in correlation with this vaccine administration.”  (link)  "
Israel Reeling From Vaccination Backfire As Cases Skyrocket Among ‘Protected’,9 AUG 2021,5284,"Getting the COVID vaccine is like willingly shortening your life. Alex Bererson explained: I have a bigger Stack planned on the Pfizer trial results. But Israel has gone back to being more transparent, and the new data are now too bad not to highlight. A reminder – Israel and the United Kingdom were the two major countries that vaccinated earliest and most aggressively. And they are much better at providing data than the United States – they provide updates every day, which limits their opportunities to manipulate it. Israel is now segmenting the number of serious cases by vaccinated and unvaccinated and by age on its primary data dashboard, available here: https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general?utm_source=go.gov.il&utm_medium=referral You can use Google translate and check it for yourself. It’s actually pretty straightforward. So here’s the chart of new serious cases each day: As you can see, new serious cases have risen 10-fold since the beginning of July – from roughly five a day to about 40 over the last week. The overall number of patients has soared too – from 30 to more than 200. But how many of those people are vaccinated? The vast majority. Israel has broken out the data in various ways at various times, but throughout July most new patients were vaccinated. In an effort to play down that reality, Israel has begun to provide data comparing RATES of serious illness in older people who were not vaccinated and those who were. And those show that as of now, unvaccinated people are still becoming seriously ill significantly more frequently than those who aren’t. But that comparison hides a very big problem. Israel did an excellent job convincing people over 60 to be vaccinated. Only about 1 person in 15 in that age range didn’t receive at least one dose. Fewer than 1 in 10 is not fully vaccinated. Why should you care? Because the tiny fraction of older people who are unvaccinated in Israel at this point are almost certainly materially different than the vast majority who are. As far as I know, the Israel government hasn’t broken out the differences. But given the pressure to vaccinate, a significant number of those older unvaccinated people are likely simply too sick to tolerate the vaccine – especially those over 80, where overall vaccination rates are even higher. But if they are too sick to tolerate the vaccine, they are obviously at much higher risk from Covid than the vaccinate. In other words, ability (and propensity) to be vaccinated is likely a marker for overall health. Researchers know this is true of the influenza vaccine – once they adjust for the fact that older people who get the vaccine are healthier to start than than those who don’t, the advantage the vaccine seems to offer mostly disappears. So the comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated isn’t useful. What is useful is examining the trend among serious illness in older vaccinated people. And it is terrible. The rate of cases has risen 12-fold IN A MONTH. On July 4th, fewer than 1 older vaccinated person in 100,000 became seriously ill. Today the rate is 10 in 100,000. Remember – comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated at this point hardly matters. THE DARK GREEN LINE IS THE ONE THAT COUNTS: And though we cannot be sure what will happen next, it is worth noting that rates of serious illness among the vaccinated are now as high as they were among the unvaccinated only TWO WEEKS AGO. Perhaps that’s why the Israeli government is now predicting a further quadrupling of new serious cases by the end of August. A quadrupling would represent 800 serious cases, approaching the peak of the winter surge (which was itself probably FUELED by a spike in cases following the first vaccine dose) – and far more than at this time last year. And remember, Israel CANNOT BLAME THE UNVACCINATED FOR THIS SPIKE – around 85 percent of adults over 30 are fully vaccinated. That’s well above the range experts said would provide herd immunity. And yet instead of pulling back and at least considering a pause on vaccinations as it digests the disaster of the last month, Israel is going the other way – pushing a third dose on the elderly. Meanwhile the cry to mandate or quasi-mandate vaccinations in the United States is only getting louder.

CDC Unveils COVID Concentration Camp Plan For US: Interment Time 6 Months?,9 AUG 2021,12995,"The report states: “There is no empirical evidence whether this approach will increase, decrease or have no effect on morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in various humanitarian settings.” But, the plan to inter free citizens is moving forward. Read the plot to enslave the population here: This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings.1,2  This approach has never been documented and has raised questions and concerns among humanitarian partners who support response activities in these settings. The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data. Considerations are based on current evidence known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may need to be revised as more information becomes available. Please check the CDC website periodically for updates. The shielding approach aims to reduce the number of severe COVID-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (“high-risk”) and the general population (“low-risk”). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or “green zones” established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector or community level depending on the context and setting.1,2 They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents. Current evidence indicates that older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.3 In most humanitarian settings, older population groups make up a small percentage of the total population.4,5  For this reason, the shielding approach suggests physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population to prioritize the use of the limited available resources and avoid implementing long-term containment measures among the general population. In theory, shielding may serve its objective to protect high-risk populations from disease and death. However, implementation of the approach necessitates strict adherence1,6,7, to protocol. Inadvertent introduction of the virus into a green zone may result in rapid transmission among the most vulnerable populations the approach is trying to protect. A summary of the shielding approach described by Favas is shown in Table 1. See Guidance for the prevention of COVID-19 infections among high-risk individuals in low-resource, displaced and camp and camp-like settings 1,2 for full details. Table 1: Summary of the Shielding Approach1 The shielding approach requires several prerequisites for effective implementation. Several are addressed, including access to healthcare and provision of food. However, there are several prerequisites which require additional considerations. Table 2 presents the prerequisites or suggestions as stated in the shielding guidance document (column 1) and CDC presents additional questions and considerations alongside these prerequisites (column 2). Table 2: Suggested Prerequisites per the shielding documents and CDC’s Operational Considerations for Implementation The shielding approach outlines the general “logistics” of implementation –who, what, where, how. However, there may be additional logistical challenges to implementing these strategies as a result of unavailable commodities, transport restrictions, limited staff capacity and availability to meet the increased needs. The approach does not address the potential emotional, social/cultural, psychological impact for separated individuals nor for the households with separated members. Additional considerations to address these challenges are presented below. Consideration: The number of green zones required may be greater than anticipated, as they are based on the total number of high-risk individuals, disease categories, and the socio-demographics of the area and not just the proportion of elderly population. Explanation: Older adults represent a small percentage of the population in many camps in humanitarian settings (approximately 3-5%4,5), however in some humanitarian settings more than one quarter of the population may fall under high risk categories13,14,15 based on underlying medical conditions which may increase a person’s risk for severe COVID-19 illness which include chronic kidney disease, obesity, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, many camps and settlements host multiple nationalities which may require additional separation, for example, Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya accommodates refugees from 19 countries.16 Consideration: Plan for an extended duration of implementation time, at least 6 months. Explanation: The shielding approach proposes that green zones be maintained until one of the following circumstances arises: (i) sufficient hospitalization capacity is established; (ii) effective vaccine or therapeutic options become widely available; or (iii) the COVID-19 epidemic affecting the population subsides. Given the limited resources and healthcare available to populations in humanitarian settings prior to the pandemic, it is unlikely sufficient hospitalization capacity (beds, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and staff) will be achievable during widespread transmission. The national capacity in many of the countries where these settings are located (e.g., Chad, Myanmar, and Syria) is limited. Resources may become quickly overwhelmed during the peak of transmission and may not be accessible to the emergency affected populations. Vaccine trials are underway, but with no definite timeline. Reaching the suppression phase where the epidemic subsides can take several months and cases may resurge in a second or even third wave. Herd immunity (the depletion of susceptible people) for COVID-19 has not been demonstrated to date. It is also unclear if an infected person develops immunity and the duration of potential immunity is unknown. Thus, contingency plans to account for a possibly extended operational timeline are critical. Consideration: Plan to identify additional resources and outline supply chain mechanisms to support green zones. Explanation: The implementation and operation of green zones requires strong coordination among several sectors which may require substantial additional resources:  supplies and staff to maintain these spaces – shelters, IPC, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), non-food items (NFIs) (beds, linens, dishes/utensils, water containers), psychosocial support, monitors/supervisors, caretakers/attendants, risk communication and community engagement, security, etc. Considering global reductions in commodity shortages,17 movement restrictions, border closures, and decreased trucking and flights, it is important to outline what additional resources will be needed and how they will be procured. Consideration: Ensure safe and protective environments for all individuals, including minors and individuals who require additional care whether they are in the green zone or remain in a household after the primary caregiver or income provider has moved to the green zone. Explanation: Separating families and disrupting and deconstructing multigenerational households may have long-term negative consequences. Shielding strategies need to consider sociocultural gender norms in order to adequately assess and address risks to individuals, particularly women and girls. 18,19,20 Restrictive gender norms may be exacerbated by isolation strategies such as shielding. At the household level, isolating individuals and limiting their interaction, compounded with social and economic disruption has raised concerns of potential increased risk of partner violence. Households participating in house swaps or sector-wide cohorting are at particular risk for gender-based violence, harassment, abuse, and exploitation as remaining household members may not be decision-makers or responsible for households needs.18,19,20 Consideration: Plan for potential disruption of social networks. Explanation: Community celebrations (religious holidays), bereavement (funerals) and other rites of passage are cornerstones of many societies. Proactive planning ahead of time, including strong community engagement and risk communication is needed to better understand the issues and concerns of restricting individuals from participating in communal practices because they are being shielded. Failure to do so could lead to both interpersonal and communal violence.21,22 Consideration: Ensure mental health and psychosocial support*,23 structures are in place to address increased stress and anxiety. Explanation: Additional stress and worry are common during any epidemic and may be more pronounced with COVID-19 due to the novelty of the disease and increased fear of infection, increased childcare responsibilities due to school closures, and loss of livelihoods. Thus, in addition to the risk of stigmatization and feeling of isolation, this shielding approach may have an important psychological impact and may lead to significant emotional distress, exacerbate existing mental illness or contribute to anxiety, depression, helplessness, grief, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide among those who are separated or have been left behind. Shielded individuals with concurrent severe mental health conditions should not be left alone. There must be a caregiver allocated to them to prevent further protection risks such as neglect and abuse. The shielding approach is an ambitious undertaking, which may prove effective in preventing COVID-19 infection among high-risk populations if well managed. While the premise is based on mitigation strategies used in the United Kingdom,24,25 there is no empirical evidence whether this approach will increase, decrease or have no effect on morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in various humanitarian settings. This document highlights a) risks and challenges of implementing this approach, b) need for additional resources in areas with limited or reduced capacity, c) indefinite timeline, and d) possible short-term and long-term adverse consequences. Public health not only focuses on the eradication of disease but addresses the entire spectrum of health and wellbeing. Populations displaced, due to natural disasters or war and, conflict are already fragile and have experienced increased mental, physical and/or emotional trauma. While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings. As with many community interventions meant to decrease COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, compliance and behavior change are the primary rate-limiting steps and may be driven by social and emotional factors. These changes are difficult in developed, stable settings; thus, they may be particularly challenging in humanitarian settings which bring their own set of multi-faceted challenges that need to be taken into account. Household-level shielding seems to be the most feasible and dignified as it allows for the least disruption to family structure and lifestyle, critical components to maintaining compliance. However, it is most susceptible to the introduction of a virus due to necessary movement or interaction outside the green zone, less oversight, and often large household sizes. It may be less feasible in settings where family shelters are small and do not have multiple compartments. In humanitarian settings, small village, sector/block, or camp-level shielding may allow for greater adherence to proposed protocol, but at the expense of longer-term social impacts triggered by separation from friends and family, feelings of isolation, and stigmatization. Most importantly, accidental introduction of the virus into a green zone may result in rapid transmission and increased morbidity and mortality as observed in assisted care facilities in the US.26 The shielding approach is intended to alleviate stress on the healthcare system and circumvent the negative economic consequences of long-term containment measures and lockdowns by protecting the most vulnerable.1,24,25 Implementation of this approach will involve careful planning, additional resources, strict adherence and strong multi-sector coordination, requiring agencies to consider the potential repercussion among populations that have collectively experienced physical and psychological trauma which makes them more vulnerable to adverse psychosocial consequences.  In addition, thoughtful consideration of the potential benefit versus the social and financial cost of implementation will be needed in humanitarian settings.  "
Next ‘Pandemic’ Generated By Vaccinated Carriers: Dose Creates Path for More Dangerous Virus,6 AUG 2021,7406,"The fact that the government is claiming that the unvaccinated (people who are able to actually think for themselves) are establishing more dangerous variants and creating the next pandemic, proves that the opposite is true… it is the vaccinated sheep who are generating the next pandemic (as planned). Conservative Treehouse explained: One of the more commonsense approaches to reviewing COVID-19 data, amid the outbreak of the ‘Delta variant’,  is to look at the percentage of vaccinated people in a regional population, and then look at the percentage of vaccinated people in the hospital with “covid related” symptoms.  [Obviously, the presumption is – if the COVID illness is severe enough to require hospitalization, then the patient is severely or acutely sick.] A review of Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, area populations/hospitalizations previously showed the percentage of hospitalized COVID patients with the vaccine is identical to the percentage of people vaccinated in the population served by the hospital.   The same data was reflected in the statistics released by Public Health Scotland (link). The percentage of vaccinated people hospitalized is identical to the percentage of people vaccinated in the population. ♦ What does that mean? Quite simply, it means the vaccine provides no benefit with a COVID-19 illness severe enough to require hospitalization.  So, if the vaccine provides no benefit then why take it, that’s the bottom line question.  Before going deeper, first watch this video segment: Since that video and discussion above took place in May 2020, we now have a massive number of people who have been vaccinated.  Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we also now have the data on those vaccinated people coming into contact with the COVID-19 virus after their vaccination (‘Delta Variant’).  The data is very troubling, because it confirms what was presented in that video. A review of a sizable data-set from Public Health Scotland shows that 87% of the deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 are amid the vaccinated population [SEE DATA]. Putting both sets of empirical data together, this is what you discover: (1) The vaccination provides no benefit to stop the COVID-19 virus infection rate. (2) The vaccine does not stop hospitalization from severe symptomatic illness. (2) The vaccine does not stop severe acute respiratory failure that results from SARS-CoV-2 infection. (3) The vaccinated population that are hospitalized and then die from COVID-19 represent 87% of all deaths. These troubling outcomes also are confirmed by the Red Cross earlier saying: “Vaccinated people cannot contribute convalescent blood plasma to help other COVID-19 patients in hospitals.  That plasma is made up of antibodies from people who have recovered from the virus, but the vaccine wipes out those antibodies; making the convalescent plasma ineffective in treating other COVID-19 patients.” So, the second alarming question is:  Does the vaccine actually create a pathway, an “antibody immune enhancement” that makes the infection more deadly? Unfortunately, the data starting to come out now seems to say, yes.  People appear to have a more severe illness when exposed to the virus after vaccination.  That would explain why there is such a high percentage of deaths amid the vaccinated population after exposure. NOTE: the mortality rate could be a matter of scale.  The elderly population have a higher vaccination rate, and the elderly population have a higher hospitalization rate; ergo the older population group, a more vulnerable population group, would make up a higher percentage of people who have died from COVID related illnesses.   More study seems to be urgently needed. Overall, the COVID-19 mortality rate is lower than the flu mortality rate; and both are influenced heavily by pneumonia as the symptomatic cause of death. ♦ Ryan Christian is a researcher who has done a very deep dive into the historic CDC and WHO record of flu cases and now COVID cases.  He has an extensive video presentation with dozens of citations from his data research [Main Article]. Christian’s ongoing research indicates the COVID-19 virus is no more deadly than the flu; and Christian uses a historic reference of flu deaths being over-reported and conflated.  Citing a hidden 2011 report to the World Health Organization about avian H5N1 and a new A(H1N1) human influenza virus: WHO (2011) – […] The pandemic policy was never informed by evidence, but by fear of worst-case scenarios. […] In both pandemics of fear, the exaggerated claims of a severe public health threat stemmed primarily from disease advocacy by influenza experts. In the highly competitive market of health governance, the struggle for attention, budgets and grants is fierce. (link) HHS (2017) – US data on influenza deaths are false and misleading. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges a difference between flu death and flu associated death yet uses the terms interchangeably. Additionally, there are significant statistical incompatibilities between official estimates and national vital statistics data. Compounding these problems is a marketing of fear—a CDC communications strategy in which medical experts “predict dire outcomes” during flu seasons.  (link) Those cited historic examples set the baseline to see how three different sets of illness are being conflated in 2021 to maintain a COVID-19 pandemic policy based on fear, worst case scenarios and false data. From the CDC website they tell us that deaths from pneumonia, influenza and COVID (PIC) are all reported as COVID-19 deaths without differentiation. CDC – “Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on July 29, 2021, 7.4% of the deaths that occurred during the week ending July 24, 2021 (week 29), were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage is above the epidemic threshold of 5.5% for week 29. Among the 1,381 PIC deaths reported for this week (week 29), 642 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certificate, and one listed influenza, indicating that current PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not influenza. The data presented are preliminary and may change as more data are received and processed.” (link) All Pneumonia, Influenza and COVID deaths (the PIC group) are reported exclusively as COVID deaths; and all of that data is dependent on how the hospitals “code” the death.  If all deaths are coded as covid deaths, then the CDC mortality data is assembled based on false baselines. The entire presentation by Ryan Christian is worth reviewing.  The discussion is wonky and somewhat in the deep weeds, but everything is massively cited with direct sourcing to back up the hypothesis.  [RokFin Video Presentation Here] and his heavily censored Website is HERE. ♦ Bottom Line: COVID-19 is not more deadly than the flu UNLESS you have taken the vaccine; then it might be more dangerous.  The vaccine is ineffective at stopping severe COVID illness and, data suggests, might actually make things worse…. creating a perpetual need for continued booster modifications to counteract the initial issue. There’s something sketchy about the vaccine when contrast against this data, the CDC twisted language, and the scale of government/media pushing and requiring it. I do not say this lightly."
CDC: Vaccine Doesn’t Prevent Transmission… Get Vaccinated To Prevent Transmission,6 AUG 2021,953,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing conflicting orders, it appears. Breitbart News explained: On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky stated that with the Delta variant, coronavirus vaccines cannot prevent transmission anymore, and urged people to get vaccinated “to protect you from transmission to others, as well as to protect all of us from seeing a more aggressive emerging variant.” Walensky said, “Our vaccines are working exceptionally well. They continue to work well for Delta with regard to severe illness and death, they prevent it. But what they can’t do anymore is prevent transmission. So, if you’re going home to somebody who has not been vaccinated, to somebody who can’t get vaccinated, somebody who might be immunosuppressed or a little bit frail, somebody who has comorbidities that put them at high risk, I would suggest you wear a mask in public, indoor settings.”"

Mail in ballots same signatures voting multiple times Someone is benefiting pic.twitter.com/hU1d7BfbtW — CONNIE’S CORNER (@CRRJA5) August 3, 2021 AUDIO CLIP 1: WOMAN SURPRISED TO FIND OUT SHE HAS BEEN VOTING: “They’ve got a Sylvia Thomas…voting in Harris County,” said private investigator and former FBI Special Surveillance Group member Charles Marler, who called Sylvia Thomas and correctly cited her February 19, 1940 birth date. Sylvia Thomas says “I’ve been away from Harris County” and confirmed that she has not voted in Harris County in recent years even though someone has been obtaining absentee ballots on her behalf. The woman does not recognize the name of Tomar Bishop, who obtained the absentee ballots associated with Thomas’ identity, or Gloria Palmer, the recent Sheila Jackson-Lee campaign PAC vendor who oversaw Tomar Bishop. Sylvia Thomas wonders “What else are they doing?” in addition to fraudulently voting on her behalf. Here is Sylvia Thomas’ absentee ballot application in the 2020 election (with her address obscured), which is just one of the fraudulent absentee ballot applications in the possession of NATIONAL FILE. AUDIO TWO: A DEAD MAN APPLIES TO VOTE: In this call, private investigator Charles Marler confirms with a woman in Harris County that a man who applied to “vote” in the election named Jesse Burks passed away on November 4, 2015. The woman confirms this death. The dead Burks’ address matches the address of the “voter.” The woman does not recognize Tomar Bishop, who obtained the absentee ballot, or Gloria Palmer, who mailed the dead man’s ballot application in. AUDIO THREE: A DEAD MOTHER APPLIES TO VOTE: Private investigator Charles Marler confirms with a woman in Harris County that her mother Gloria Chambers, born in 1946, voted in the election despite dying in 2010. The daughter of the deceased voter does not know Tomar Bishop, who obtained the absentee ballot, or Gloria Palmer, who mailed the dead woman’s vote in. “That’s fine, because we don’t know either one of those people,” said the daughter of the dead voter, consenting to cooperate with Marler’s investigation. Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign paid convicted forger Gloria Palmer as a “campaign assistant” multiple times in 2020, according to Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign financial disclosures. Investigator Charles Marler confirms that the Gloria Palmer, who was paid by Jackson Lee’s campaign, is the same Gloria Palmer who mailed in the absentee ballot applications in 2020. A record shows Sheila Jackson Lee For Congress PAC paying Gloria Palmer for canvassing and campaign work in 2018. Here is a record of Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign paying Gloria Palmer to be a “campaign assistant” in 2020. Investigator, Charles Marler, tells NATIONAL FILE that “The vast majority of victims are people who are not aware their vote was stolen. In Harris County the first ballot in from ballot harvesters is counted, all second votes are discarded for that individual.” LET’S BREAK DOWN THE FACTS ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FRENZIED FINAL WEEKS OF THE 2020 ELECTION: Harris County, Texas conducted 24-hour voting in the 2020 election, even as the county became engulfed in a voter fraud scandal that ensnared the Joe Biden campaign’s recent Texas political director Dallas Jones. A well-placed insider named Constance Stanton tells NATIONAL FILE that Dallas Jones was interrogated by the FBI and fired by the Biden campaign after he was implicated in an illegal Ballot Harvesting operation in sworn affidavits first reported by NATIONAL FILE. This scandal has since been picked up by various news outlets across the nation, including by Fox News. Vote count discrepancies are reported in Harris County. Sources within the FBI told NATIONAL FILE that Dallas Jones was interrogated but was not necessarily “picked up,” implying that Jones voluntarily submitted to FBI interrogation. Multiple sources tell NATIONAL file that Jones was fired by the Biden campaign. (RELATED: Texas Poll Watcher Testifies on 2020 Voter Fraud in Houston). Here is what Constance Stanton told NATIONAL FILE in October: “Harris County Clerk’s Office in Harris County, Texas is intending to conduct an illegal polling operation on Thursday, October 29th, 2020. Harris County, home to Houston Texas, is the third largest voting county in the country with approximately 2.5 million voters. As Harris County goes, so goes Texas. As Texas goes, so goes the nation.  Harris County did not allow the GOP State Conversation to take place this past summer and it seems the socialist Democrats took complete control of Harris county when they won offices in 2018, by a 200,000 vote margin. 20 private investigators have uncovered a great deal. What has been uncovered is a group of masterminds wanting to destroy the Texas voting voice. Some of the masterminds include Democrat County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and Democrat State Senator Boris Miles. They have two captains, Gerald Womack and Dallas Jones. Jones was hired by the Biden campaign to run the Biden Texas operation. These captains have scores of paid vote harvesters working for them. Vote harvesting is a second-degree felony under the Texas Election Code. This is a criminal operation that these Democrat elected officials are running. Dallas Jones was picked up by the FBI, the weekend before last, for 2 days of interrogation. He was subsequently fired by the Biden campaign. They harvest ballots by mail from nursing homes, homeless centers, door to door in poor neighborhoods, often dressed as Census workers. They offer $50 gift cards in front of stores asking people to take ballots by mail, acquired from the above, to sign and mail at a local post office. They hold ballots by mail in several locations where people forge signatures on the collected ballots by mail. Evidence has been presented to the local DA, Kim Ogg, who received a substantial amount of political contributions from Soros funded organizations in her election in 2018. The evidence included an affidavit and other evidence, including photographs, from a 30 year black police officer who was serving as a poll watcher and saw the election judge use a table full of IDs to vote unregistered people that were voting by drive through. This is a criminal act according to the Texas Election Code. The district attorney’s office did not even want to entertain our criminal complaint. This information along with other affidavits of harassment of poll watchers and alternate election judges was sent to the office of Republican Atty. General Ken Paxton. The Democrat County clerk, Chris Hollins, instituted drive-through voting by anyone for any reason which is in violation of the Texas Election Code. A petition for writ of mandamus before the Texas Supreme Court last week to stop this illegal activity and they voted 7 to 1 to deny the petition. The County clerk has now opened up the early voting polling locations until 10 PM for the rest of the week until the last day of early voting, when eight polling places will be open 24 hours. Of the 120 early voting locations, the vast majority are in Democrat areas of the county. In violation of the Texas Election Code, Hollins independently mailed ballots by mail to all individuals 65 and older, in violation of Texas Election Code, which requires an individual to request a ballot by mail before it can be sent. Hollins planned on sending every registered voter a ballot by mail, but the Texas Supreme Court granted our petition and stopped this. The Harris County voter files have not been purged since 2016 when the Democrats took charge. We can document that dead people have voted in this election and people who have moved out of state. No arrest warrants have been issued and we do not expect them to issue any. In the meantime, the Democrats are implementing their massive election voter fraud scheme, mostly in open sight. One arrest would go miles in stopping this election fraud scheme. The drive through locations are located in primarily in Democrat areas. This also violates the 14th Amendment.” At Harrisvotes.com, clicking on “Polling Locations” and then the clock icon for “Hours of Operation” show that beginning on Thursday October 29 there were EIGHT polling locations that had 24-hour voting rolling into Friday morning. Harris County, where Houston is located, is also the site where the Joe Biden campaign’s Texas political director Dallas Jones is accused of running an illegal ballot harvesting operation, according to two separate affidavits submitted to the Texas Supreme Court by former law enforcement officials. Here is the GoFundMe page for private investigators who are busting what insiders say is one of the largest voter fraud rings in the United States. Here is a photo from the scene of the stack of driver’s licenses. Here Is The Sworn Affidavit, Under Oath, of Raymond T. Stewart: “My name is Raymond T. Stewart. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct. “I am a 30+ year veteran Texas Peace Officer. I am a volunteer poll watcher for Candidate Andre Hines. On 10/13/2020, at 8:40am, I arrived at polling location Northeast Multi-Services Center, PRCT ID SRD141C, 9720 Spaulding Street, Houston, Texas 77016.” “I informed the staff that I was a poll watcher for a candidate and had my paperwork. I asked for the precinct judge to sign my required paperwork so I could start work. The precinct judge is identified as April Elmore (Gibson) and she was there but refused to sign my paperwork and she instead directed me to someone inside named Madonna. Madonna signed the paperwork but not in the designated signature line. I then began my work as a poll watcher.” “I observed several oddities but the most concerning was a table in-between the sign-in tables One and Three. At that table was a large stack of Texas Driver’s Licenses. Staff would come inside from the drive-through voting booth and scan a driver’s license from someone outside and get a ticket and return outside. But sometimes a staff member would search through the stack of driver’s license on the table, then scan it, receive a ticket and also go outside to the drive-through booth. As a Police Officer, I quickly became suspicious that they were committing a crime by having the unattended D.L.’s just sitting on the table and that possible voting crimes were being committed using these forms of ID. Also during this time-frame an employee of the Harris County Attorney’s Office came by and he conversed with April but nothing changed and he departed. Since I was there as a poll watcher and not there as a Police Officer, I just continued to observe and considered how to deal with this situation. About that time a Precinct 1 Constable (Deputy W. Schultz) arrived at the polling location and he happened to be someone I knew professionally. I spoke with the Deputy outside and informed him of what I had observed. He was amazed and asked for evidence which I provided to him.” “Unfortunately our conversation was overheard by a staff member in the parking lot. The Deputy went inside the polling location but at this time the driver’s licenses were removed and hidden from the table. The Deputy departed the area apparently to consult with the election taskforce and supervisors. A spoke with him several times that day via phone and in person regarding my observations. At 1:00pm April commanded me to leave the polling location because I had observed and collected evidence and she informed me that ‘I couldn’t.’ I have not received any call from any Federal, County nor State official investigating these serious actions and crimes.” Raymond T. Stewart’s Affidavit Concludes NATIONAL FILE RECENTLY REPORTED: Two private investigators, including a former FBI agent and former police officer, testify under oath that they have video evidence, documentation and witnesses to prove that Biden’s Texas Political Director Dallas Jones and his cohorts are currently hoarding mail-in and absentee ballots and ordering operatives to fill the ballots out for people illegally, including for dead people, homeless people, and nursing home residents, in the 2020 presidential election. The affidavits were filed as part of the class-action lawsuit against Harris County and the state of Texas, filed by citizens, called Steven Hotze, M.D. et al. Journalist Patrick Howley of NATIONAL FILE has exclusively obtained this testimony and much more evidence will be coming out in the case. Dallas Jones was named the Biden campaign’s Texas Political Director in early September. HERE IS THE AFFIDAVIT OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND RETIRED HOUSTON POLICE OFFICER MARK A. AGUIRRE, SUBMITTED UNDER OATH. READ IT HERE: AFFIDAVIT OF MARK A. AGUIRRE “My name is Mark A. Aguirre. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct. “I am a retired captain with the Houston Police Department I am now a private investigator. “I am currently involved in an investigation related to a wide-ranging and fraudulent ballot harvesting scheme in Harris County intended to rig the elections in the Houston/Harris County area. This scheme involves voter fraud on a massive scale. “Based on interviews, review of documents, and other information, I have identified the individuals in charge of the ballot harvesting scheme. These individuals includes political consultant Dallas Jones who was recently hired by the Joe Biden for President campaign to oversee their Harris County initiative. District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles, who is the handler of Mr. Jones, political consultant Gerald Womack, and Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis. One of the companies these individuals are using as a front for this operation is AB Canvassing, although there are others that have been identified that we are investigating.” “I have in my possession video-taped interviews of witnesses attesting to the aforementioned people having groups of people completing thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots, including completing ballots for deceased individuals; illegally going into nursing homes, with the complicity of the nursing home staff, and filling out and forging the signatures of nursing home residents; signing up homeless individuals to vote using the ballot harvester’s address then completing the ballot and forging the homeless individual’s signature. “This entire operation is being run by the elite politicians of the Democrat Party in Houston/Harris County. FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT. HERE IS THE AFFIDAVIT OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND FORMER FBI AGENT CHARLES MARLER, SUBMITTED UNDER OATH. READ IT HERE: 2020-09-27_Charles F. Marler Affidavit:  “My name is Charles F. Marler. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.” “I formerly worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigations where I was an Investigative Specialist conducting undercover operations on espionage and terrorist targets. I am now a private investigator.” “In December of 2019, I was approached by two individuals who witnessed activity from an illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County. Since that date, I have been investigating the illegal ballot harvesting operation.” “During my investigation, a core group of names continued to surface regarding the organization and operation of the voter fraud scheme. Witnesses have stated to me that Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles are leading the illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas. Their chief lieutenants are Houston businessman Gerald Womack and political consultant Dallas Jones who work directly under them in executing the ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas.” “Witnesses have shown me and described to me how the ballot harvesters take absentee ballots from the elderly in nursing homes, from the homeless, and from unsuspecting residences’ mailboxes. The ballot harvesters then complete the ballots for their preferred candidate and forge the signature of the “voter”. Two witnesses stated to me that there are two individuals employed at the Harris County Clerk’s Office who are aware of the illegal ballots and help facilitate and mask the processing of the ballots into the legal stream of ballots.” “I have been made aware of a law enforcement investigation in the Spring of 2020 regarding illegal ballot harvesting. Several interviews of individuals were conducted. After the interviews became public, former Harris County Clerk Diane Troutman, resigned alleging health concerns due to COVID-19. However, witnesses have told me that Ms. Troutman was arguing with Commission Rodney Ellis about the legality of the mass purchasing and mailing of mail-in ballots and that Troutman was concerned she would be included in the eventual arrest pertaining to illegal ballot harvesting. Instead of coming forward and exposing the scheme, Ms. Troutman abruptly resigned. Witnesses have stated that Commissioner Ellis was not deterred and continued to move forward with the plan to mass mail ballots and expand the illegal ballot harvesting scam. Another witness stated to me that an employee of Commission Ellis, Tyler James, has bragged that he could guarantee that the illegal ballot harvesting operation, with the help of mass mail-in ballots, could harvest 700,000 illegal ballots.” “It appears that law enforcement agencies are currently investigating these alleged crimes and I will provide them with the evidence that I have already collected and am continuing to collect. Sadly, these law enforcement agencies will be working to prosecute these crimes well after the November 3, 2020 election.” Here Is The GoFundMe Page for the ongoing private investigation which is working with law enforcement. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton recently announced 134 felony charges against four defendants stemming from an alleged 2018 Democrat primary scheme to use fake disabilities provide mail-in ballots to people who were not disabled. The Democrat claim that fear of Coronavirus constitutes a disability has been only partially successful in Texas. Harris County is sending mail-in ballot applications to county voters 65 and over, so nursing homes remain a hotspot for potential fraud. Texas began mailing absentee ballots to voters for the presidential election on September 19. NATIONAL FILE RECENTLY REPORTED Citizen journalist Colleen Vera has discovered evidence of what appears to be a massive voter fraud ring operating in the state of Texas involving mail-in voting and Democrat political campaigns. Evidence presented below includes a video of a Democrat campaign surrogate harvesting mail ballots from a nursing home, audio of a Democrat campaign worker admitting to harvesting ballots from a nursing home, and mail-in ballots from Harris County that all have the same handwriting and envelope process. Vera alleges that the campaign of Democrat Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee recently paid two convicted forgers, and that other Democrat campaigns have also paid convicted forgers for canvassing efforts. I spoke to Collen Vera regarding her findings as well as longtime Democrat Party operative Gerry Monroe, who knows full well what is happening in Harris County. Colleen Vera of Texas Trash Talk Reports… After the 2016 Democratic Primary, a candidate for Harris County Constable (Pct 3), Jasen Rabalais, filed a lawsuit claiming that a campaign worker for another candidate,Michel Pappillion, “deliberately falsified, illegally completed or unlawfully influenced the ballots and early voting applications of elderly residents in Harris County.” The lawsuit was dismissed. But the following audio tapes had been made by the  Rabalais campaign  after he found out that an “alleged harvester” was working for an opponent’s campaign. Link to Audio #1:  Gives name of “alleged harvester” Link to Audio #2:  “Alleged harvester” explains the services provided (phone # redacted) Then during the 2018 Primary, the following video was posted by Direct Action Texas. It appeared to show a campaign worker for Texas State Rep Harold Dutton Jr harvesting ballots of 400 elderly voters. After viewing the video, I decided to do some research. I figured, if there was any evidence of mailed ballot voter fraud to be found in Harris County, the more recent one – Dutton’s race – was the best place to start. I filed a request for public information covering the 1359 voters who voted by mail in Harold Dutton’s race. I requested electronic copies of the voters’: My first thought was to match each voter’s mailed ballot application with the voter’s ballot envelope and compare signatures to find those which may not match. But as I reviewed the documents, something else jumped off the page… 32 hand written applications for mailed ballots – all from different voters – but all written in the exact same handwriting. Looking closer, something else jumped off the page. All 32 returned their application for a ballot by mail in the same pre-printed envelope with the same style stamp. But then I printed out the envelopes which carried their returned ballots and the BIGGEST COINCIDENCE of ALL jumped off the page…ALL THESE VOTERS LIVED IN THE SAME PRECINCT!  Precinct #259…Additional research showed this same handwriting on multiple ballot by mail applications from precinct #259 every year going back to 2008…If that wasn’t enough to cause concern, I had to title this set of applications “Alleged Harvester A” because I found two more sets of multiple applications with similar handwriting, envelopes and stamps from varying precincts. I titled those “Alleged Harvester B” and “Alleged Harvester C.”… 30 ballots from Precinct #259 – in which the voters voted for ALL the same candidates – and they ALL used the same style “X” to mark their ballots. …I filed another public information request and received a handwritten sign out sheet for persons who had picked up packages of 50 or more applications for mailed ballots in 2018. Two concerning issues from that list. Federal Election Commission records show that US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee did make multiple payments to convicted forger Gloria Palmer in 2016."
FDA Fast Tracking Deadly COVID Vaccine To Allow Forced Injections For States,5 AUG 2021,2260,"In order to make it possible for states to make forced injections of the deadly vaccine possible, the FDA has announced that it is fast-tracking the approval. The Gateway Pundit reported: According to the VAERS website there have been 8,182 deaths pinned to the Pfizer/Biontech coronavirus vaccination. The VAERS database contains information on unverified reports of adverse events (illnesses, health problems and/or symptoms) following immunization with US-licensed vaccines. The CDC government website links to VAERS platform. The elites have yet to offer a credible explanation on how these thousands of reported deaths are illegitimate. There have been over 400,000 adverse reactions reported to the COVID vaccine according to the VAERS website. But this hasn’t stopped the Biden-Obama government from pushing the FDA to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. That way they can force Americans to get the vaccine to participate in public life. VOA reported: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is aiming to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by early September, according to The New York Times. The two-dose vaccine, which Pfizer developed in collaboration with German-based BioNTech, was granted emergency use authorization by the FDA last November. It is one of just three COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. stockpile, along with the two-shot vaccine from Moderna and the single-dose version developed by Johnson & Johnson. The newspaper says the FDA is accelerating its normal timetable to grant full approval to the two-dose vaccine as the United States undergoes a new surge of coronavirus infections and hospitalizations caused primarily by the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19. The recent surge of new infections is mainly among people who have not gotten vaccinated. The Times quotes recent polls by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research group, which found that three of every 10 unvaccinated people in the U.S. said they more likely would take a fully approved vaccine. The surge has prompted a growing number of public and private entities to issue mandatory vaccinations for all of its employees, including an order last week by U.S. President Joe Biden for all employees of the federal government."
"“There Is No Freedom, Only Tyranny!” Australian Senator Stands Up To COVID Dictatorship",5 AUG 2021,6568,"In Australia, the government has become a dictatorship, using COVID (aka common cold) as the excuse and justification to establish a police state. Conservative Treehouse explained: Many people have looked at what is taking place in Australia with jaws agape.  Indeed, if there exists any system of western democracy that has taken more stronger totalitarian measures during covid than Australia, they are not easily identified. There were reports in early 2020 of the United Nations organizing 5-stages of COVID lock-down plans, with “stage-5” being the most restrictive; and the Australian government agreeing to be the beta-test for the fifth stage; the ultimate police state.  If true, that explains the incredibly undemocratic and authoritarian controls triggered by the government down under. The Australian army is patrolling the streets; all businesses are forcibly shut down; formerly free citizens now locked inside their homes; sky-marshals patrolling from the air and warning via loudspeakers to disperse; concentric rings of physical checkpoints around major metropolitan areas; dissidents and non-conformists identified, targeted and arrested by violent Australian police.  Yes, this sounds like a dystopian science-fiction novel; however, it is all the current reality in Australia…. and the government is claiming they are only in “stage 4“! One Senator, Malcolm Roberts, warns the Australian government they are on the wrong side of history…. [Transcript] – “As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I speak tonight on freedom. On many occasions in the last year I have addressed the Senate in regard to freedom as a counterbalance to medical tyranny. And I recently addressed the Canberra Freedom Rally, remotely. The side that is locking people up for the crime of being healthy, arresting protesters, pepper spraying kids, beating up grannies, banning books and electronic messages, censoring social media, sending threatening letters, forcing small businesses to close, urging people to dob in dissenters and banning safe drugs that have worked for 60 years are all on the wrong side of history.” “In a frightening development, New South Wales has called in the troops to keep innocent, healthy citizens locked in their homes in what can only be called martial law. Recent freedom marches showed what happens to citizens who exercise their democratic right to protest. People are demonized, hunted down; the media vilifies them to discourage others from questioning the control state. If the government can decide who is free and who is not, then that is not freedom and no-one is free. A crisis will always be found to justify measures designed to protect the government, not the public—a crisis that is as is easy to create as turning up the PCR test from 24 cycles to 42, where a false positive is the most likely outcome, as has occurred. Actions such as these have created a crisis of confidence in government, and that, fellow citizens, is on the Senate. We are the house of review. We’re tasked with a duty to ensure honesty, transparency and accountability in the government of the day. We have failed in that solemn duty, our duty to our constituents. We have failed those who are yet to vote, our children, who are now being injected with a substance that has not undergone meaningful safety testing. The Liberal, National and Labor parties have colluded to waive these measures through this place, reducing the Senate to the status of a dystopian echo chamber. Each new restriction, although met with rightful public opposition, has not led to a re-evaluation but, rather, has led the government to crack down even further. The Morrison government is behaving like a gambling addict who loses a hand but doubles down instead of admitting error and walking away. With troops now on the streets, it’s frightening to contemplate where this will end. Everyday Australians are being deliberately demoralized to extract a higher degree of compliance. When COVID first arrived, there were few masks, and the experts and authorities told us masks were not necessary. Now, those same medically ineffective masks are used to condition people to fear and obedience. Crushing resistance crushes hope, and without hope we have no future. Is it any wonder that small businesses are closing permanently? Every small business that closes is a family that was being provided for through hard work and enterprise. Who will look after those families now—the government? With whose money? The Reserve Bank, using electronic journal entries, can only create fiat money out of thin air for so long before it runs down our country. The government can only sell bonds until buyers stop coming forward. Then what happens? We will have no tax base left to pay government stipends to people who were once able to pay their own way. Since when has the Liberal Party, the supposedly party of Menzies, been dedicated to making huge sections of the population totally reliant on the government for survival? The bad joke here is that the excuse used to justify the sudden rush to Marxism—public health—is moot. Death from all sources, including coronavirus and the flu, are at historic lows. Australia’s death rate in 2020 was less than in 2019, and 2021’s death rate is lower again. We’re strangling Australia’s economic life and future for no reason. Power has gone to the heads of our elected leaders and unelected bureaucrats, who are exercising powers yet do not feel the consequences themselves. Never in history has Lord Acton’s famous quote rung more true: ‘Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.’ It’s been calculated that the civil disobedience tipping point—which is the maximum capacity of the police to arrest people, of the jails to hold people and of the courts to process people—is in Australia around 100,000 people. Anything more than that and the system comes crashing down. Attendance at the freedom rallies last month shows we’re almost there. No wonder the Morrison government has been scared into resorting to the refuge of tyrants—using the military to intimidate civilians into compliance and to mandating injections and threatening to rip away people’s livelihoods. Everyday Australians are seeing through the smokescreens of fear and intimidation. People now see that the costs of the restrictions to family and community exceed the medical cost of the virus. Everyday Australians have spoken. We will not be divided, we are united, we are one community, we are one nation.” ~ Malcolm Roberts (August 3, 2021)"
"Florida Sheriff Busts Massive Pedo Ring: “These are Nasty, Nasty People”",5 AUG 2021,14950,"The Polk County Sheriff in Florida has done it again. Defending freedoms and stopping evil appears to be his calling, and he just chalked up another 17 monsters. Fox 13 reported: WINTER HAVEN, Fla. – Over a dozen arrests were made after suspects thought they were on their way to meet young teenagers to have sex, but it turned out they were communicating with undercover detectives across several agencies in central Florida. Among those arrested were three Walt Disney World employees, a registered nurse, and a married man visiting from California, officials say. The six-day operation targeted those who use the internet to prey on children, according to the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. In total, 17 suspects face 49 felonies and two misdemeanors. “These are nasty, nasty people,” described Sheriff Grady Judd. “We can’t even use the words that they used. We obviously can’t show the pictures and video clips that they sent to what they thought were 13-year-old little girls and little boys.” All but one lived in central Florida. A man, identified as 33-year-old Jarrod Justice, was visiting from Los Angeles, detectives said. “He showed up on vacation but he only needed to buy a one-way ticket because he’s not flying back to Los Angeles anytime soon,” Sheriff Judd said. “He’s married. Mrs. Justice did you hear that? His last name is Justice. That’s what we’re going to get. Justice for Justice.” Three suspects worked for Disney: two custodians at Disney’s Hollywood Studios theme park and a lifeguard at the Animal Kingdom Lodge hotel. The lifeguard was identified as 26-year-old Kenneth Javier Aquino of Orlando. “He left his girlfriend who was 7 months pregnant with his child in order to have sex with a 13-year-old,” Judd said during Tuesday’s press conference. The two custodians were identified as 34-year-old Jonathan McGrew of Kissimmee and 29-year-old Savannah Lawrence of Kissimmee, who are in a relationship together, the sheriff said, adding that they thought they could have a threesome with a 13-year-old girl. “[Jonathan] said to the child, ‘We want to enjoy this opportunity, we don’t want to rush. Even at the conclusion maybe we can cuddle a little bit,'” Judd explained. “Are you kidding me? That’s how you talk to 13-year-old children? ‘Our fantasy is to play stepdad, stepdaughter, stepmom; teacher, student; maybe even shoplifter where we do a strip search.’ He gave all of these details before the two of them show up.” The agency worked with the police departments in Auburndale, Orlando, and Winter Haven, along with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office during the investigation. The following information on each suspect was provided by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office: 1. 26-year-old Kenneth Javier Aquino of Orlando On July 27, 2021, Aquino engaged in an online conversation on a social networking site with an undercover detective who was posing as a 13-year-old girl.

He asked for the address to the undercover location and then drove to the area, where he was arrested after a traffic stop while trying to leave the area. He told deputies that he is an apprentice line technician for Powertown Line Construction, and that he left his two children at home with his mother when he traveled to have sex with the minor. His criminal history includes a previous arrest for battery. Nelson was booked into the Polk County Jail and charged with: 15. 34-year-old Jonathan McGrew of Kissimmee On August 1, 2021, McGrew engaged in an online conversation with an undercover detective who was posing as a 13-year-old girl. He told the “girl” that he wanted her to come to his apartment and have sex with him and his girlfriend, Savannah Lawrence (arrest details below). He sent videos of him and his girlfriend performing sex acts on each other. He asked for the address to the undercover location and then he and Lawrence took an Uber to the location, where they were arrested without incident. McGrew communicated with another undercover detective who was posing as a 14-year-old girl during the same time frame, also telling her that he wanted to have sex with her. Upon their arrests, McGrew and Lawrence told deputies that they are custodians at Walt Disney World’s Hollywood Studios. His criminal history includes a previous arrest for leaving the scene of an accident involving injury or death (in Illinois). McGrew was booked into the Polk County Jail and charged with: 16. 29-year-old Savannah Lawrence of Kissimmee On August 1, 2021, Lawrence’s boyfriend, Jonathan McGrew, engaged in an online conversation with an undercover detective who was posing as a 13-year-old girl. McGrew told the “girl” that he wanted her to come to his apartment and have sex with him and his girlfriend, Lawrence. McGrew sent videos of the pair performing sex acts on each other. Lawrence rode with McGrew in an Uber to the location, where they were arrested without incident. They told deputies that they are custodians at Walt Disney World’s Hollywood Studios. Lawrence was booked into the Polk County Jail and charged with: 17. 37-year-old Edward McGaffigan of Orlando On August 1, 2021, McGaffigan engaged in an online conversation with an undercover detective who was posing as a 14-year-old girl, then asked for her phone number and communicated with her that way. He told the “girl” that he wanted to have sex with her, then he sent her several explicit photos of himself. Detectives obtained a warrant for his arrest, and he was taken into custody at his Orlando home. He told deputies that he is a professional poker player. His criminal history includes a previous arrest for DUI (in Virginia). McGaffigan was arrested in Orlando on the Polk warrant and booked into the Orange County Jail for:"
DeSantis Responds To Direct Attacks By Biden Regime: Florida Will Remain Free!,5 AUG 2021,3185,"There is at least one real man in politics in America… Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida. He is taking a strong stance against the globalist push to enslave and impoverish Americans using deadly COVID vaccines and ‘passports’ similar to the ones used by authoritarian leftists throughout history. Conservative Treehouse reported: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis directly responded to the attacks from Joe Biden and the White House over DeSantis’ decision to block forced vaccinations, forced mask mandates, block CDC demanded shut-downs and keep schools open and mask-free for in-person teaching. Earlier today, Governor DeSantis took direct aim at the manipulative control effort from the federal bureaucracy, and said Florida will not be a biomedical surveillance state on his watch.  The remarks were deliberate, resolute and unwavering in defense of the constitutional freedoms and protection from obtrusive government.  The visibly determined governor told Joe Biden the federal demands would not be happening “on my watch.” “If you are coming after the rights of parents in Florida, I’m standing in your way – and not letting you get away with it.  If you are trying to deny kids a proper in-person education, I’m standing in your way” … “If you are trying to restrict people and impose mandates; if you are trying to lock people down; I am standing in your way and standing for the rights of the people in Florida” … “Why don’t you do your job, why don’t you secure the border, and until you do that – I don’t want to hear a blip about COVID from you.” NOTE: Ron DeSantis did not kill himself…. The Gateway Pundit added: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came out swinging against Joe Biden on Wednesday. Joe Biden on Tuesday attacked Republican Governors Ron DeSantis (FL) and Greg Abbott (TX) for pushing back on vaccine passports and mask mandates. “If some governors aren’t willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it,” Biden said of Florida and Texas. “If you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way,” he added. Not a word about the tens of thousands of Covid-infected illegal aliens pouring into Texas every month because of Biden’s open borders policies. Ron DeSantis blasted Joe Biden on Wednesday. “Why don’t you do your job? Why don’t you get this border secure? And until you do that, I don’t wanna hear a blip about COVID from you,” DeSantis said to Biden. Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Florida Gov.

Vaccinated Only: New York Goes Full Orwell To Kill Liberty Dead In Big Apple,4 AUG 2021,3135,"In New York, only vaccinated people will be able to move about in society. ‘Ministries of Compliance’ will be checking whether or not a person has had the experimental, deadly COVID vaccine. Conservative Treehouse reported: Comrade rebels, effective September 13th, anyone living or visiting New York City who has not been vaccinated will be blocked from entering any private venue, restaurant or indoor facility.  Businesses will be required to operate security checkpoints, where people without proof of vaccinated status will be denied entry. Your engagement with the system of commerce will now be controlled by the New York Ministry of COVID Compliance. [New York] … “It’s time for people to see vaccination as necessary to living a good and full and healthy life,” de Blasio said during his daily press briefing. “This is crucial, because we know that this will encourage a lot more vaccination.” The program, which de Blasio dubbed the “Key to NYC Pass,” makes New York the first major US city to create such a mandate, and marks a significant escalation of the city’s efforts to curb the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant. The initiative will launch on Aug. 16, the mayor said. “It will require vaccination for workers and customers in indoor dining, in indoor fitness facilities, indoor entertainment facilities,” he said from City Hall. “The only way to patronize these businesses indoors is if you’re vaccinated.”  “If you want to participate in society fully, you’ve got to get vaccinated,” de Blasio added. (read more) It will be interesting to see how this is enforced.  It will also be interesting to see if underground networks of rebellious residents will establish a secondary economic system for the non-vaccinated who defy the regime. CTH has said since the original communist network of Barack Obama was created in Chicago, that if they were successful in fully executing their plan, a fundamental fracturing of society would take place.  A few years later, as we watch the successful seeding of the revolutionary communists around Obama, we warned CTH readers to think carefully about where you live because the cleaving along ideological lines was ultimately going to happen. The prediction we made upon the launch of The Last Refuge was specifically based on accepting the reality that if the Obama network was successful, there would have to be a natural fracturing of society.  The division and fragmentation away from the communal mindset was a predictable outcome. Many American people, perhaps barely the majority, will not acquiesce to losing freedom and living under totalitarian rule.  That is why the Obama network wanted to import millions of people who are in alignment with full socialist and governmental control over their lives. The resistance will live on…. it always does.  But, at a certain point it becomes necessary to move your physical body away from a place where you are under control, and set up your homestead in a place where freedom is still permitted. That is why we said in 2011, “WHERE WILL YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE“?  We knew this was coming.  Choose wisely…."
Physicians Group Rejects AMA Support For Vaccine Mandates,2 AUG 2021,2624,"A group of scientists has rejected the leftist-controlled AMA’s decision to support vaccine mandates. Arizona Daily Independent reported: The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is rejecting the Joint Statement by the American Medical Association (AMA) and others supporting mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for all health care workers. American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) president Paul Kempen, M.D., Ph.D. outlined the reasons the group believes the mandate is not only a violation of individual rights, but wholly unnecessary:     AAPS statement in opposition: “The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) declares that all human beings have the right to liberty, which they do not forfeit when they serve the sick or the disabled. The ethical commitment to protect others does not require workers to surrender their bodily integrity and self-determination…. “Risks and benefits differ in individual patients and differing circumstances. Achieving a stamp of approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—premature because studies are not scheduled to be complete before the end of 2022—does not confer safety or effectiveness. FDA-approved products have frequently been withdrawn…. “The Joint Statement recognizes only a medical exemption, and omits mention of a religious exemption though many workers object to receiving these products based on their religious beliefs. Medical exemptions are virtually never recognized for the COVID vaccines because there is improper denial that they cause harm to anyone. “Long-term effects of these novel, genetically engineered products cannot possibly be known at this point. These could include autoimmune disorders, antibody-enhanced disease, infertility, cancer, or birth defects…. “AAPS favors insistence on fully informed, truly voluntary consent for all medical intervention. This includes full disclosure of all risks, and a diligent effort to identify and track risks…. Our medical organizations should be advocating for free and open discussion and opposing censorship…. “Without freedom, there is no safety for either workers or our patients.” On Wednesday, nearly 200 people gathered at the Arizona Capitol to protest forced vaccinations of healthcare workers. Hospital workers were joined by supporters who object to the demand by Banner Health and HonorHealth that their employees get fully vaccinated by November. The two large healthcare systems are likely just the first of many that will require their employees to get the vaccine or have their employment terminated. Smaller health care organizations will likely follow suit."
Fauci Claims “Individual Rights” No Longer Exist During COVID Era,2 AUG 2021,3399,"Apparently, someone changed the constitution overnight, giving Anthony Fauci the power to determining individual rights. Oh, wait… it’s just something in his delusional, evil mind. While starting up his round of propaganda segments on the mainstream media this weekend, Fauci claimed individual rights no longer exist, and threatened Americans, saying things will get worse (you know, from the flu). Conservative Treehouse reported: I’m more worried about what is happening behind the scenes in the non-COVID universe while everyone is distracted by the purposeful weaponization of the healthcare institutions.  It’s the other thing, the unseen activity, that is most troublesome when the leftists are this entrenched on a singular narrative. In this clip from Anthony Fauci on ABC This Week Sunday [Rumble Link], the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, claims that individual rights no longer exist during the era of COVID-19.  When you consider the mindset of the far-left, his opinion on communal rights -vs- individual rights is right in line with the collectivist perspective.  These people are dangerous. “The fact is, if you get infected, even if you are without symptoms, you very well may infect another person who may be vulnerable … So in essence, you are encroaching on their individual rights.” It appears from the visible evidence, the Delta variant of COVID-19 may well be more transmissible; perhaps even more transmissible due to increased shedding from people who are vaccinated carriers of the virus.  However, the death rate is lower than the traditional flu. All of these extreme mitigation efforts appear constructed to protect against something that just doesn’t carry the scale of risk that would match the severity of alarm we are bombarded with.   If you turn off the television, disconnect from corporate media and tune-out these alarmist proclamations, life appears to be carrying along just fine. Full Interview is available Here The Gateway Pundit added: It’s Sunday, which means Fauci in on TV pushing CCP propaganda and trying to scare Americans into getting an experimental vaccine. Dr. Fauci defended the CDC’s 180 on mask mandates for vaccinated people and said “things are going to get worse” because of a surge of the ‘Delta’ variant among unvaccinated people. “Things are going to get worse,” Fauci told ABC’s “This Week” host Jon Karl on Sunday. “I don’t think we’re going to see lockdowns,’ Fauci said. “I think we have enough of the percentage of people in the country – not enough to crush the outbreak – but I believe enough to allow us to not get into the situation we were in last winter.” Fauci blamed unvaccinated people for the surge in Covid cases. “We have 100 million people in this country who are eligible to be vaccinated who are not getting vaccinated,’ he said. “The unvaccinated, who have a much much much greater chance of being infected in the first place, are the ones most vulnerable to getting severe illness that might lead to hospitalization and in some cases death,” he added. “So we’re looking not to lockdown, but we’re looking to some pain and suffering in the future because we’re seeing the cases go up, which is the reason why we keep saying over and over again, the solution to this is get vaccinated or this would not be happening.” Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found"
Slippery Slope: Leftist School Super Will Distribute ‘Yellow Badges’ Based On Vaccination Status,30 JUL 2021,3996,"In one Illinois school district, yellow badges, reminiscent of the yellow Star of David Jews were forced to wear under the Nazi regime, are being issued for vaccinated students. The cost of historical ignorance is high… God help us. The Conservative Treehouse reported: They are not using armbands, yet; however, one school district in Galesburg, Illinois, is issuing color-coded identification to visibly label vaccinated and non-vaccinated school district employees.   This is how the process of stigmatization is begun; be aware of what is coming. According to sources in Illinois School District 205 (Galesburg, IL), School Superintendent John Asplund sent the notification (screenshot below) to school staff members announcing a new staff ID badge policy. [Galesburg CUSD #205 LINK] School staff now have the option to change from the customary white ID badge to a yellow ID badge to indicate that they have received the COVID-19 vaccine.  This policy is currently only limited to school staff and does not apply to students.  However, it can be anticipated the school may begin to visibly identify non-vaccinated students. This is a slippery slope where peer pressure and stigmatization become a serious issue.  How long will this remain voluntary?  This creates a dynamic of virtue-signalling peer pressure on school staff to publicly display their private health information.   As noted by one of the affected recipients of the notification, “This policy will prompt a lot of bullying, ostracism, and cliquish behavior.” Additionally, the passage in the email that states, “At this point in time, proof of vaccination does not give you any additional benefits…” is striking to me. The implication here is that employment or social compact benefits within the district may be designated or assigned -at a future date- based on vaccinated status.  If this was not an active part of the thought process within the administration, the notation about “additional benefits” would not be present. The social issues in/around COVID-19 mitigation have been catastrophic for our educational system.  Creating a class system based on vaccination status is very troubling.  Keep an eye open for this type of activity surfacing in your area. This is a troubling development. Act or be acted upon…. push-back now or silence is the same as consent ! The Gateway Pundit added: Galesburg, IL School District 205 Superintendent John Asplund sent this shocking email out to staff members announcing a new ID badge policy. School staff now have the option to change from the customary white ID badge to a yellow ID badge to indicate that they have received the covid vaccine. They are actually going to use Yellow Badges for identification. This policy is currently only limited to school staff and does not apply to students. This is horrific and abhorrent. No school, employer, or any other type of entity has any right to stigmatize people or make people in any way display any sort of mark or indicator that communicates their vaccination status or any other health or personal criteria that is no one else’s business to know. This policy will prompt a lot of bullying, ostracism, and cliquish behavior. This is eerily similar to how the Nazis made Jews wear a yellow Star of David to publicly indicate that they were Jewish. This needs to be strongly protested and promptly stopped. The passage in the email that states, “At this point in time, proof of vaccination does not give you any additional benefits…” is striking to me. What is the point of getting vaccinated if you still have to wear a mask? Making vaccinated people wear a mask is stupid and senseless. Many people who got the vaccine did so with the understanding that the vaccination would allow them to live life without being masked. This just shows that you can’t comply or bargain your way out of tyranny. This lesson has been demonstrated throughout history. We always had the right to live mask free regardless of vaccination status."
Inventor of mRNA Vaccine Explains: Shots Make Virus More Dangerous,29 JUL 2021,4954,"The COVID virus, which can be cured using a wide variety of medicines and vitamins, is more dangerous when the mRNA vaccine is used, according to the inventor of these gene-altering shots. The Gateway Pundit explained: Dr. Robert Malone, M.D., M.S.,, a distinguished physician who discovered RNA transfection and invented mRNA vaccines, was on Steve Bannon’s War Room Weednesday with some alarming news–new data indicates that people who have taken the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are at greater risk of getting Covid than someone who is not vaccinated. Before you watch the video, you need to understand the term–Antibody-Dependent Enhancement aka ADE: Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), sometimes less precisely called immune enhancement or disease enhancement, is a phenomenon in which binding of a virus to suboptimal antibodies enhances its entry into host cells, followed by its replication.[1][2] ADE may cause enhanced respiratory disease and acute lung injury after respiratory virus infection (ERD) with symptoms of monocytic infiltration and an excess of eosinophils in respiratory tract.[3] ADE along with type 2 T helper cell-dependent mechanisms may contribute to a development of the vaccine associated disease enhancement (VADE), which is not limited to respiratory disease. According NBC reporting (I can’t believe I’m citing that outfit as a reliable source): New data suggests that fully vaccinated individuals are not just contracting COVID, but could be carrying higher levels of virus than previously understood, facilitating spread, my NBC News colleagues are reporting. New indoor masking guidance expected today. Dr. Malone has warned of this risk for several months. What are we to do? Malone says that instead of relying on the flawed vaccines, Doctors should use drugs for treating Covid that have proved effective, such as Ivermectin (more about that following the video), is neutralizing Covid. What should scare the hell out of you is the extraordinary efforts being taken to silence and discredit Dr. Malone. I encourage you to read Michael Haynes piece from July 5, which details Malone’s Kafkaesque ordeal. Here are some relevant paragraphs from his article: Information about the inventor of the mRNA technology used in certain COVID-19 vaccines was removed from the online encyclopedia site Wikipedia after he publicly warned against giving the experimental gene therapy vaccines to young people and that there was insufficient information about the injections to give informed consent. . . . On June 10, 2021, Dr. Malone joined biologist Bret Weinstein, Ph.D, on the Dark Horse Podcast, where Malone raised numerous safety concerns about the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, both of which use mRNA technology. He warned about future autoimmune issues caused by the spike proteins within the mRNA injections. Malone also stated that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was aware that the spike proteins were “biologically active and could travel from the injection site and cause adverse events, and that the spike protein, if biologically active, is very dangerous.” YouTube swiftly moved to censor clips from the three-hour podcast interview. This is the kind of authoritarian censorship carried out by Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Pol Pot. When the media and the Government conspire to quash dissenting opinions and legitimate, provable facts, we have crossed the threshold of fascism. The same effort to discredit Dr. Malone also has been unleashed against non-vaccine treatment methods. Remember what happened to anyone who dared suggest using Hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin? And do you remember the news stories in May about how Covid was devastating India? I bet you have heard little about the efficacy of Ivermectin in stopping Covid in Dehli. Dr. Pierre Kory told the world on December 8, 2020, that Ivermectin “obliterates” this virus. Obliterate means to decimate, demolish, or annihilate. It means to eliminate or destroy all trace, indication, or significance. This graph shows that Ivermectin, used in Delhi beginning April 20, obliterated their COVID crisis. No one should be able to talk you out of this – not a salesman, a drug company, a television celebrity doc, and certainly not the top doctor for the WHO or the NIH who is paid to do that. It is your duty as an American to challenge and question everything the Government represents as true. We now have concrete evidence that Dr. Anthony Fauci has taken diametrically opposed positions without blinking an eye. Some call that “lying.” The same with the CDC (as I pointed out in my last article).  Perhaps the CDC should be renamed the Center for Disinformation & Confusion in light of the contradictory guidance issued regarding masks and vaccines. Unfortunately, the chaos of Biden’s Covid policy reflects the dysfunction and incompetence evident in the rest of his Administration. Keep praying and continue to resist."
CDC Is Hiding COVID Data As Experts Demand “Higher Load” Evidence,29 JUL 2021,11090,"According to the liars at the CDC, the newly vaccinated sheep are more contagious than unvaccinated people. Experts are demanding to see the evidence of the claim. The Houston Chronical reported: WASHINGTON – New recommendations from federal health officials this week on when vaccinated Americans should don face masks came with a startling bolt of news: People who have had their shots and become infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus can harbor large amounts of virus just like unvaccinated people. That means they could become spreaders of the disease and should return to wearing masks indoors in certain situations, including when vulnerable people are present. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not publish the new research. In the text of the updated masking guidance, the agency merely cited “CDC COVID-19 Response Team, unpublished data, 2021.” Some outside scientists have their own message: Show us the data. “They’re making a claim that people with delta who are vaccinated and unvaccinated have similar levels of viral load, but nobody knows what that means,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health. “It’s meaningless unless we see the data.” When CDC Director Rochelle Walensky spoke to reporters Tuesday, she cited the “new scientific data” but provided limited details about how the research was done. She said the data comes from outbreak investigations in which researchers compared delta infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The data will be “published imminently,” according to a federal official knowledgeable about the research but who was not authorized to be a spokesperson for the government. “These data were alarming and recently presented,” the official said Wednesday. “We saw the data and thought it was urgent enough to act – in the context of a steeply rising, preventable fourth surge of covid-19.” Because tests showed similar levels of virus in the vaccinated and unvaccinated, the CDC inferred the delta variant can be transmitted by people with breakthrough infections. “I think the implications [of the data] are that people who are vaccinated, even when they’re asymptomatic, can transmit the virus, which is the scientific foundation of why this recommendation is being made,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said in an interview with The Washington Post. But Fauci noted there is not yet clinical data on what the high viral loads mean in terms of disease transmission. “You can make a reasonable assumption that vaccinated people can transmit the virus just like unvaccinated people can,” Fauci said. Three senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions said the new research convinced health officials that it was time to update the agency’s guidance. When scientists compared viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with an earlier variant of the virus – the alpha variant, which was dominant in the spring – there were considerable differences in the amount of virus each carried. The CDC did not answer questions Wednesday about whether it relied on outside sources of data or the number of patients examined in its outbreak investigations. The medical and scientific community has generally endorsed the change in CDC mask guidance. Several organizations and public health experts issued statements saying the CDC should have gone further and broadened the criteria for deciding which communities have transmission high enough to warrant universal masking indoors. The question about viral loads is among the many unknowns surrounding SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of breakthrough infections and whether they play a significant role in the recent rise in cases. “If we’re seeing more breakthroughs, is it just because the virus is better and the vaccines don’t hold up quite as well, or is the efficacy of the vaccines beginning to wane, independent of the delta?” asked Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “This is three-dimensional chess, there’s a hundred things going on at the same time.” There is now a Greek-alphabet soup of viral variants competing with one another. The delta, which was first identified in the United States in February and only gained traction in June, is dominant in the United States. “The big concern is that the next variant that might emerge, just a few mutations away, could potentially evade our vaccine,” Walensky said Tuesday. There are multiple vaccines deployed to stop the pandemic, with a range of efficacy in stopping mild infections. The vaccines are all highly protective against severe disease and death. Pfizer published data Wednesday showing a modest drop in efficacy over the course of six months. Although delta is more than twice as transmissible as earlier variants, it does not have some of the mutations seen in other variants that can help the virus evade antibodies. But the delta floods the zone. It grows so quickly in the nose that it may be overwhelming the body’s vaccine-enhanced defenses before the immune system can marshal a robust response, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The immune response, once activated, takes a while to kick in even among people who have been vaccinated,” Hanage said in an email. “As a result if the virus can copy itself really quickly it might be able to get a few rounds of replication in, even in vaccinated folks, before the immune system brings it under control.” The Singapore Ministry of Health recently found that three-fourths of coronavirus cases in the past four weeks were in people who were fully or partially vaccinated, most with no or mild symptoms. And in India, vaccinated health-care workers showed high viral loads when infected with the delta, according to a study from University of Cambridge researchers that is not yet peer-reviewed. The senior author of that study, microbiologist Ravindra Gupta, said the infectivity of people with breakthrough infections has not been “formally measured in a rigorous way,” but the new research shows high viral loads in people with breakthrough delta infections. That suggests vaccinated people should wear masks, he said. Research by Chinese scientists posted online and not yet peer-reviewed describes the stunning ability of the delta variant to replicate in the human body. The viral load from the delta is 1,000 times that detected in the earliest variants of the virus. That is about 10 times the viral load sparked by the alpha variant, which was first seen in the United Kingdom and became dominant in the United States this spring before the delta overcompeted it. “Delta is alpha on steroids,” said James Musser, chair of the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine at Houston Methodist Hospital and Research Institute. In the eight hospitals run by Houston Methodist, there are about 300 covid-19 patients, triple the number in early June, Musser said. Most new cases involve the delta variant. He estimated that 20 percent of the covid patients were fully vaccinated before becoming infected. But he cautioned that most of these patients have underlying medical conditions that impaired their ability to mount an immune response after being vaccinated. These post-vaccination infections have often been described by Walensky and other medical experts as rare. How rare is unclear. News reports of people getting sick after vaccination have been common in recent weeks. But scientific data is limited. The CDC on May 1 said it would stop tracking mild and moderate breakthrough cases, and focus only on hospitalizations and deaths. As of July 19, the CDC had documented 5,914 such breakthroughs, including 1,141 deaths. CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said Wednesday the agency conducts “cohort” studies to obtain estimates of the efficacy of the vaccines that often involve tens of thousands of people. Scientists examine vaccinated and unvaccinated patients for a period of time to see if they develop covid-19, Nordlund said. Several experts have criticized the agency for not tracking mild and moderate breakthrough cases on a broader scale, arguing it makes it difficult to know how rare these cases really are. Even though the vaccines remain effective against all variants of the coronavirus, they are not designed to create “sterilizing” immunity. That’s why breakthrough infections happen. The virus can infect the nose and begin replicating before the immune system rallies its range of defenses. The vaccines prime the immune system, including the “B memory” cells that begin cranking out antibodies after detection of an invasive pathogen. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said it’s like the fire extinguisher in your kitchen. The immune system ensures you have that fire extinguisher standing by for an emergency. But it can’t prevent the initial conflagration. “You still had a little fire in the kitchen,” Offit said. Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said it would not be surprising to see a variant emerge that is better at replicating in people’s noses. Animal studies, he said, indicated that vaccines were better at protecting animals’ lungs from infection than their noses. That might help explain why vaccinated people can become infected but rarely develop severe disease. “The virus is under selective pressure to jump from nose to nose,” Corey said. “So its evolutionary sort of pressure is to do that as efficiently as it can. Delta is more efficient than others.” Even if tests find lots of virus in vaccinated people, it is uncertain how contagious they are. A study of immunized health-care workers in Israel, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 39 breakthrough infections among 1,497 fully vaccinated people. About three-fourths of those people had, at some point while infected, what researchers characterized as high viral loads. There was no evidence that a breakthrough case led to other infections. Natalie Dean, a biostatistics expert at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, said she remains unconvinced a high viral load in the nose truly means that vaccinated and unvaccinated people are equally as likely to spread the virus, although she acknowledged there is an ongoing debate about the issue. “I feel like nasal viral load is one part of a lot of other parts” that determine how infectious a person is, Dean said, adding that she thinks the amount of virus in the throat or lungs could be important and might differ between people who are vaccinated and those who are not. New data suggests that fully vaccinated individuals are not just contracting COVID, but could be carrying higher levels of virus than previously understood, facilitating spread, my NBC News colleagues are reporting.

Using Real Science! Doctors Join Lawsuit Demanding Halt To COVID ‘Gene Therapy Injections’,28 JUL 2021,29384,"Frontline doctors have filed a lawsuit that seeks to disallow the ‘emergency’ use of the COVID ‘gene altering’ vaccine. Undercover DC reported: America’s Frontline Doctors filed a motion on July 19 to stop Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the experimental COVID-19 gene therapy injections. The lawsuit, filed in Alabama Federal Court against Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and others, argues for immediate injunctive relief against the COVID-19 “Vaccines” of Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson to stop them from continuing to operate under EUA. The motion also seeks to prohibit the FDA from approving the Vaccines for three categories: The lawsuit laid out by AFLDS does an excellent job, from start to finish, of explaining why there is no underlying health emergency surrounding COVID-19. To be clear, the EUA has given Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson the power to bypass the standard FDA regulations and—under the pretense of a crisis—instead rush to produce “Vaccines” to treat COVID-19. The lawsuit immediately sets forth that AFLDS do not consider these shots “Vaccines,” stating: Plaintiffs reject the highly misleading use of the term “vaccine” to describe the Pfizer and Moderna EUA medical products since they are not vaccines within the settled meaning of the term and instead are more precisely described as a form of genetic manipulation. The CDC defines a vaccine as “A product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease. Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections, but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose.” Immunity, according to the CDC, is defined as: “Protection from an infectious disease. If you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected.”  In presenting its argument against the defendants, the lawsuit affirms there is no underlying health emergency surrounding COVID-19 to support the EUA granted to the three pharmaceutical giants. AFLDS asserts that even when using the intentionally inflated COVID-19 mortality data from the defendants, the overall survivability rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 99.8% globally, which increases to 99.97% for individuals under the age of 70, and is similar to the seasonal flu. It is critical to note that on Mar. 24, 2020, DDHS changed the coding rules related to COVID-19 for coroners and others responsible for determining “cause of death” and issuing death certificates. The new rule states: “COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.” With this coding change—which the CDC was fully aware of—95% of deaths coded as “COVID-19 deaths” were actually in patients with an average of four or more diseases in addition to COVID-19. Likewise, due to the EUA of PCR tests as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2, the true number of COVID-19 “cases” is much lower than the numbers reported. Product literature from PCR test manufacturers includes disclaimers stating that the PCR test should NOT be used to test for COVID-19 and bear statements such as, “[t]he FDA has not determined that the test is safe or effective for the detection of SARS-Co-V-2.” AFLDS explains that in PCR testing, the Cycle Threshold (CT) Value (the number of times a sample is magnified before the detection of a fragment of viral RNA) is exponential. Therefore, a 40-cycle threshold means the sample is magnified close to a trillion times. Essentially, the higher the CT Value, the “less likely the detected fragment of viral RNA is intact, alive, and infectious.” As agreed upon by most scientists—including Dr. Fauci—a PCR test run at a CT Value of 35-cycles or higher is useless, with the chances of a false positive as high as 97%. Yet, most PCR tests given in the U.S. for COVID-19 testing are run at 35-45 cycles. The lawsuit draws attention to Dr. Fauci’s own words about CTs and PCR testing, emphasizing that he has stated: “What is now evolving into a bit of a standard is that if you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more that the chances of it being replication competent are minuscule…We have patients, and it is very frustrating for the patients as well as for the physicians…somebody comes in, and they repeat their PCR, and it’s like 37 cycle threshold…you can almost never culture virus from a 37 threshold cycle. So I think if somebody does come in with 37, 38, even 36, you gotta say, you know, it’s dead nucleotides, period. In other words, it is not a COVID-19 infection.” The lawsuit alleges that to support and justify the implied health emergency, defendants “and their counterparts in state governments” used the fear of “asymptomatic spread” to bolster their claims, despite there being no “credible scientific evidence that demonstrates that the phenomenon of “asymptomatic spread” is real.” The lawsuit recalls that on Sept. 9, 2020, Dr. Fauci was pressured in an official press conference to admit: “The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person, even if there is a rare asymptomatic person that might transmit, an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers.”
 Throughout the entirety of an emergency—once it has been declared and while it remains in force—the DHHS Secretary can issue and maintain EUA’s “only if” specific guidelines are met. A critical criterion is an existence of “a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.” As explained above, the suit claims SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 do not establish this within the statute’s meaning. The lawsuit maintains that allowing such EUAs to exist and continue without meeting the required criteria “could undermine the balance of power between the various branches of government.”  The statute directs EUAs can be issued and maintained by the DHHS Secretary “only if“ the specified treatment is “effective” in “diagnosing, treating or preventing a disease or condition.” Data from the CDC shows that not only do the vaccines not prevent COVID-19, but deaths from the virus also increased from 160 in April to 535 as of June 1st. Additionally, before counting ceased, over 10K “breakthrough infections” (those who have received the complete recommended dosage of the shot but still contracted the virus) were reported during the first four months of 2021. In reinforcing that COVID-19 vaccines do not meet the criteria for EUA, the lawsuit looks at the Absolute Risk of Reduction (ARR) of the shots. Through analyzing the impact of treatment by comparing the outcomes of a treated group and an untreated group, ARR determines the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV), which “signifies the number of people that must be injected before even one person benefits from the vaccine.” Recalling that vaccines were only shown to reduce symptoms, not prevent transmission, the lawsuit advises: According to a study published by the NIH, the ARR for the Pfizer Vaccine is a mere 0.7%, and the ARR for the Moderna Vaccine is only 1.1%.  Additionally, the lawsuit alleges the defendants were either wrong about the science or lied about the asymptomatic spread. Their theory of asymptomatic transmission—which was used to justify the lockdowns and mask mandates against healthy Americans—had no study participants and was based explicitly on mathematical modeling. Indeed, the lawsuit notes a monumental study, which was ignored by legacy media, corrupt doctors, corrupt politicians, and corrupt scientists: An enormous study of nearly ten million people in Wuhan, China showed that asymptomatic individuals testing positive for COVID-19 never infected others. Since asymptomatic individuals do not spread COVID-19, they do not need to be vaccinated.  Typically, vaccine creation takes between 10 and 15 years and is full of clinical trials and safety testing. However, manufacturers abandoned this process to create vaccines for COVID-19. In less than a year, roughly 42% of the American population has been fully vaccinated with these experimental treatments. Animal studies were abruptly halted, and numerous studies were considered unnecessary, leaving incomplete necessary tests, including “single dose toxicity, toxicokinetic, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, prenatal and postnatal development, offspring, local tolerance, teratogenic and postnatal toxicity, and fertility.” An in-depth analysis by AFLDS medical and legal experts of the accumulated COVID-19 risk data outlines the following: The spike protein, which is that catalyst that enables the virus to infect other bodies, is a “pathogenic protein” and a toxin that causes damage. It enters the bloodstream and circulates throughout the body, severely damaging the cardiovascular system. It causes platelets to clump, causing heart inflammation, bleeding, and clotting. It crosses the blood-brain barrier to cause neurological damage while accumulating in several tissues, including the liver, spleen, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and ovaries. It can be transferred to infants through breastmilk, with VAERS reporting incidents of “infants sucking from vaccinated mothers experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract.” Because of the lack of safety studies to rush the quickly designed vaccines, no one knew where these spike proteins would travel in the body once injected or how long they would last. For this reason, talk about booster shots fluctuates back and forth. The government database VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), established in 1986, is designed to serve as an “early warning” system for potential health risks caused by vaccines. Approximately 1% to 19%, at best, of all vaccine adverse events are reported to VAERS, leaving it highly inadequate, as pointed out by the plaintiff. Remarkably, “of the 262,000 total accumulated reports in VAERS, only 1,772 are not related to COVID-19. According to the database, the total reported vaccine deaths in the first quarter of 2021 represent a 12,000% to 15,000% increase in vaccine deaths year-on-year. From 2009 to 2019, there were 1,529 total vaccine deaths. In the first quarter alone of 2021, there have been over 4,000. The CDC’s parallel COVID-19 side-effect reporting system, an app called “V-Safe,” is inaccessible and controlled exclusively by the CDC. The spike proteins our bodies are taught to produce by the mRNA shots are in the same family as other reproductive proteins found in sperm, ova, and placenta. Antibodies created to fight the spike protein may interact with similar naturally occurring proteins in the reproductive system, and there is no data provided on this by the manufacturers. The lawsuit points to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that found pregnant women receiving the vaccine during the first or second trimester suffer an 82% spontaneous abortion rate, killing 4 out of 5 unborn babies. A leaked Pfizer document shows that an extraordinarily high number of nanoparticles accumulate in the delicate ovarian tissues, more so than in other tissues. With no manufacturer studies on this troubling discovery, the suit notes it is a cause of great concern. Furthermore, every female is born with the total number of eggs she will have for her entire life. By design, the reproductive system is arguably the most “delicate hormonal and organ balance in all our systems.” With billions of aggressive mRNA spike proteins accumulating in the ovarian tissue, this is a great cause for concern. To this day, scientists and doctors do not fully understand all of the contributing factors to infertility. Evidence also suggests the vaccines could cause “permanent autoimmune rejection of the placenta.” In essence, the body would attack the placenta as though it were an invader, ultimately making pregnancy impossible. Research shows that the spike proteins themselves damage vascular cells, causing strokes and many other problems. As is well documented, all of the COVID-19 vaccines are causing clotting disorders in all ages. The spike proteins are also known to cause clotting that the body cannot repair, like thrombocytopenia and brain thrombosis. The human immune system perceives the spike proteins from the vaccines as foreign invaders and initiates an immune response to fight them. This nature-intended scenario also causes any cell in our body that is expressing spike proteins to become a target for destruction by our own immune system, causing an immune disorder affecting virtually any organ in the body. AFLDS asserts it is likely “that some proportion of the spike protein will become permanently fused to the long-lived human proteins, and this will prime the body for prolonged autoimmune diseases,” which can take years to show up. The brain, which is unique in structure and function, is usually protected with an amazing feature called “the blood-brain barrier.” This complex and multi-layered barrier prevents nearly everything from reaching the brain and allows it to function without interruptions from the rest of the body. Sadly, unlike any other vaccine ever used, the COVID-19 vaccines can breach this barrier through different routes, including through the nerve structure in the nasal passages and through the blood vessel walls. The lawsuit says the vaccines are programmed to produce the S1 subunit of the spike protein in every cell in every Vaccine recipient. Still, this subunit causes brain damage and neurological symptoms, with the elderly at an increased risk. To explain further, the S1 subunit of the spike protein (which can cross the blood-brain barrier) is the part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that produces COVID-19 and is in the vaccines. Considering the high number of ACE2 receptors in the brain (the portion of the cell that allows the spike protein to attach to human tissue), this is even more alarming. The VAERS database shows a significant increase in reporting of neurological damage following the vaccine. The immune responses in the young and healthy are more vigorous than in others. The lawsuit points out “the vaccines are more deadly or harmful to the young than the virus, and that is excluding the unknown future effects on fertility, clotting, and autoimmune disease.” In fact, the vaccines may induce—in the very people who need immune assistance the least—a powerful and potentially harmful immune response which includes damage to their own cells and tissues. According to CDC data, those under 18 face statically ZERO chance of death from SARs-CoV-2. However, there are reports of heart inflammation in young men and at least one documented case of a fatal heart attack in a healthy 15-year-old boy two days after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Since April 2021, the CDC has admitted increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after the mRNA vaccines, particularly in young adults and adolescents. AFLDS asserts in the claim that it is a virtual certainty that healthy children, whose birthright is decades of a healthy life, will face premature death or decades of chronic disease, facing challenges around antibody-dependent enhancement, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and reproductive problems. Antibody Dependent Enhancement (“ADE”) occurs when SARS-CoV-2 antibodies created by the vaccine—instead of protecting the vaccinated person—cause a more severe or lethal case of COVID-19 when the person is later exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the wild. Rather than preventing damage—the vaccine amplifies the infection. This paradoxical reaction may only be visible after months or years of using the vaccine in populations worldwide. ADE was observed in the original SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003, which is reportedly 78% similar to the current SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. Right now, individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccines are permitted to donate their spike protein-laden blood into the blood supply, projecting all of the risks previously discussed. The lawsuit notes that healthcare professionals and scientists around the globe are frantically appealing to the FDA to halt the vaccines. Fifty-seven top scientists and doctors from Central and South America call for an immediate end to all COVID-19 vaccine programs. Seeing the catastrophic and deadly results of the rushed vaccines, other physician-scientist groups—who point out that in the past government has ended vaccine trials on far less than the facts presented now—have made similar calls, among them: Canadian Physicians, Israeli People’s Committee, Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, World Doctors Alliance, Doctors 4 Covid Ethics, and Plaintiff America’s Frontline Doctors. The scientists all agree that the spike protein produced by the vaccines causes disease even without the virus. It is important to remember that the DHHS Secretary can issue and maintain the EUA for the COVID-19 vaccines “only if” there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to them. For this reason, many experts believe alternative safe and effective treatments have been banned, ignored, or ridiculed. Tens of thousands of physicians have publicly attested to the numerous safe and effective alternative therapies for COVID-19, which are supported by over 300 studies, including randomized controlled studies. For example, observational studies in Delhi and Mexico City show impressive reductions in COVID-19 cases and deaths after mass distribution of Ivermectin. The lawsuit alleges: “Inexplicably, the Defendants never formed or assigned a task force to research and review existing alternatives for preventing and treating COVID-19. Instead, the Defendants and others set about censoring both concerns about the Vaccines and information about safe and effective alternatives.”  Once an EUA has been issued, the statute mandates that the DHHS Secretary “shall establish” conditions “designed to ensure” that both healthcare professionals and vaccine candidates receive the certain minimum required information that is essential to make voluntary, informed consent possible. Among other things, these required disclosures include (i) that the Vaccines are not FDA approved and are only authorized for emergency use, (ii) the significant known potential risks of the vaccines, (iii) available alternatives to the vaccines, (iv) the option to accept or refuse the vaccines. AFLDS asserts in its lawsuit that the Defendants have failed to educate the American public that the FDA has neither “approved” the vaccines nor has the DHHS Secretary determined they are “safe and effective.” Instead, using “weasel language” of the EUA statute, the Defendants have decided it is “reasonable to believe” that the vaccines “may be” effective and that the benefits outweigh the risks. Instead of educating the American people, the Defendants have bombarded them with messages from all levels of the federal and state government, the private sector, and the media. The President himself recently stated: “The bottom line is this: I promise you they are safe. They are safe. And even more importantly, they’re extremely effective. If you’re vaccinated, you are protected.”      Increasingly, the public is being made aware of the severe conflicts of interest that weigh on Dr. Fauci, the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which advises and consults Defendants regarding vaccine EUAs. The lawsuit maintains the public cannot assess the reliability of the information they are being given due to the conflicts of interest of the authorities providing it to them. According to the complaint, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not meet the CDC guidelines—they do not stimulate the body to produce immunity from a disease. No peer-reviewed studies demonstrate they give immunity or prevent transmission. The lawsuit alleges of the shots: “They are a synthetic fragment of nucleic acid embedded in a fat carrier that is introduced into human cells, not for the purpose of inducing immunity from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and not to block further transmission of the virus, but in order to lessen the symptoms of COVID-19.” As pointed out in the case, information is propagandized and censored on every level—including medical journals—thus, the public is uninformed about the gene therapy technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. In its SEC filings, Moderna admits “the novel and unprecedented nature of this new class of medicines.” The company also recognizes that the FDA classes its vaccine as a form of “gene therapy.” Admittedly, not being a vaccine at all, the document states: “Rather, instructions, via a piece of lab-created genetic code (the mRNA) are injected into your body that tells your body how to make a certain “spike protein” that is purportedly useful in attacking the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”      The claim alleges the population is enslaved to an offensive, coordinated $1 billion government-funded media campaign, including Biden’s door-to-door scheme, pushing the vaccines. The media campaign is reinforced by a draconian system of coercive rewards and penalties intended to convince vaccination. Even the federal government is offering a range of incentives, which include free childcare. Simultaneously, legacy news agencies and social media oligarchy across the board promote the agenda, agreeing not to publish any negative news about the vaccines—individual physicians and certain medical journals are being censored. Dr. Philippe Douste-Blazy, cardiologist and former France Health Minister and 2017 candidate for Director of the WHO and former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, described the horrifying censorship: The Lancet boss said, “Now we are not going to be able to, basically, if this continues, publish any more clinical research data, because the pharmaceutical companies are so financially powerful today and are able to use such methodologies, as to have us accept papers which are apparently, methodologically perfect but in reality, which manage to conclude what they want to conclude.” … one of the greatest subjects never anyone could have believed … I have been doing research for 20 years in my life. I never thought the boss of The Lancet could say that. And the boss of the New England Journal of Medicine too. He even said it was “criminal” — the word was used by him. That is, if you will, when there is an outbreak like the COVID-19, in reality, there are people … us, we see “mortality” when you are a doctor or yourself, you see “suffering.” And there are people who see “dollars” — that’s it.” Using fear to manipulate the public is a strategy often used in public health. After a year of constant psychological manipulation, the claim notes that society is now scared, vulnerable, and desperate for a return of its freedoms. The pressure on the defenseless to take the vaccine is unprecedented. The plaintiff argues Americans are especially vulnerable to guilt, shame, coercion, and the threat of penalties. The suit contends the unvaccinated are threatened and warned with false fears and anxiety about COVID-19, including children who aren’t at any statistical risk, and the removal of the constitutional rights of the unvaccinated, including: o Being prohibited from working
o Being prohibited from attending school or college
o Being limited in the ability to travel in buses, trains, and planes
o Being prohibited from traveling outside the United States
o Being excluded from public and private events, such as performing arts venues The lawsuit, in referencing the absence of the option to accept or refuse the vaccine after being given accurate information, reminds that the combined effect of the suppression and censorship of information about vaccine risks along with the failure to inform the public of the novel and experimental nature of the mRNA vaccines and alternative treatments is unacceptable. Furthermore, the experts failed to disclose and properly educate the public that the vaccines are neither FDA approved nor has the DDHS Secretary determined that they are “safe and effective.” Instead, the agency has only determined it is “reasonable to believe” the vaccines “may be effective” and that the benefits outweigh the risks. Certainly, the lawsuit maintains: “The sustained psychological manipulation of the public through official fear-based messaging regarding COVID-19, draconian countermeasures and a system of rewards and penalties, is to remove any possibility that Vaccine recipients are giving voluntary informed consent to the Vaccines. They have no real option to accept or refuse the Vaccines. They are unwitting, unwilling participants in a large-scale, ongoing non-consensual human experiment.” Plaintiff expert Dr. Angelina Farella is a fully licensed board-certified pediatrician for over 25 years. She has vaccinated over 10,000 patients. Dr. Farella points out that it is not only the number of people tested but the length of time that is important when creating new vaccines. Emergency Use Authorization was granted prematurely for adolescents before ANY trials were completed. Declaring that children are not at risk in the pandemic and should not be part of the experiment, Dr. Farella states: “Vaccines take years to safely test. It’s not only the number of people tested but the length of time that is important when creating new vaccines. Emergency Use Authorization was granted prematurely for adolescents before ANY trials were completed. Moderna is scheduled to complete trials on October 31, 2022, and Pfizer is scheduled to complete trials on April 27, 2023. There were no trial patients under the age of 18. The FDA and these pharma companies are currently allowing children 12 years old to receive this shot when they were never studied in the trials. Never before in history have we given medications that were not FDA approved to people who were not initially studied in the trial.” Local governments are recklessly passing laws eliminating the requirement for parental consent or even knowledge of medical treatments given to children as young as 12. The lawsuit contends these moves are intended to set the stage for children to be vaccinated at school at the government’s will. Lacking the complete brain development capable of giving voluntary, informed consent to vaccines, children already have a well-known and scientifically studied vulnerability to peer pressure. In this case, the lawsuit points out that with the COVID-19 vaccine, this age group—the under-18 subpopulation —is particularly susceptible to being injected with the vaccine “for the sake of other people and society,” threatening them with immediate and potentially life-threatening harm. A recent Cleveland Clinic study shows that natural immunity acquired through prior infection with COVID-19 is more robust than the benefits one would gain from the vaccine, rendering it unnecessary. The claim reveals that previously infected individuals had 96.4% immune protection from COVID-19, versus 94.4% in those injected with the vaccine. Moreover, an Israeli study showed that less than 1% of new cases are in people who had been previously infected with COVID-19. By comparison, 40% of new COVID-19 cases are in those infected for the first time despite being vaccinated. Some argue the CDC’s recent elimination of the reporting of breakthrough cases could be because of this information. Those previously infected with COVID-19 who then received the vaccine are also prone to “Vaccine-driven disease enhancement.” A person who gets the shot after having the disease mounts an immune response that is between 10-20% stronger than the response of a previously uninfected person. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine noted antibody titers 10-45 times higher in those with preexisting COVID-19 immunity after the first Vaccine injection, with 89% of those seropositive reporting adverse side effects. As the lawsuit notes, this substantial risk is suppressed in mainstream national news. The lawsuit includes expert testimony from an anonymous whistleblower name “Jane Doe,” a computer programmer in the healthcare data analytics field. This witness, who writes fraud detection algorithms, has access to Medicare and Medicaid data maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In her expert opinion, VAERS “under-reports deaths resulting from the Vaccines by a conservative factor of at least 5, indicating the true number of deaths caused by the Vaccines is at least 45,000.”  In asking for a preliminary injunction against the Defendants, enjoining them from continuing EUA of the Vaccines, the lawsuit upholds the defendants themselves suffer no conceivable harm from them being granted, explaining: A disease that has an overall survivability rate exceeding 99%—comparable to the seasonal flu and countless other ailments—does not create a public health emergency within the meaning of § 360bbb–3. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 do not give rise to any countervailing public interest that justifies overriding the constitutionally protected right to personal autonomy and bodily integrity. This is so with respect to the entire American public, but even more acutely with respect to the under-18 age category and those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."
Schumer Questions How Majority Of Americans Voted For “Racist” President Trump,27 JUL 2021,3080,"In typical democrat fashion (using blatant lies and accusations that are the epitome of hypocrisy), Chuck Schumer blasted “racist” President Trump and the vast majority of Americans who support him. The Gateway Pundit explained: Democrat Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) attacked Trump supporters over the weekend during a community meeting with New York State assembly member Rebecca Seawright. “You probably ask yourself the same question I ask myself: How could 74 million people vote for such a despicable human being as Donald Trump,” Schumer said. “He is a vile man. He is dishonest. He is divisive — That’s what he loves to do, just divide people.” Schumer added, “He’s a racist and he always appeals to the dark side of human nature, which he’s very good at, unfortunately. How did they vote for him?” Schumer said. Schumer didn’t get the memo. We’re also “deplorable” according to Hillary Clinton. Breitbart News reported: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer berated 74 million Trump voters, saying at an event with Roosevelt Island and Upper East Side community leaders in New York that they voted for a “despicable,” “racist,” and “vile” man. “How could 74 million people vote for such a despicable human being as Donald Trump?” Schumer asked in the video. “I don’t care if you’re a liberal or a conservative, Democrat or Republican, he is a vile man.” “He is dishonest, divisive. That’s what he loves to do. Just divide and have people fighting with each other. He’s a racist,” Schumer claimed. “And he always appeals to the dark side of human nature.” Schumer’s statement is similar to those made by failed presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney. In 2016, Hillary Clinton called Trump voters a “basket of deplorables.” The full quote ran as follows: You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic – you name it. And, unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric. Now some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully, they are not America. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said during his presidential run in 2012 that 47 percent of voters will vote for former President Obama “no matter what” because they are entitled: There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That, that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. “And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number,” Romney continued."
"“Get That Vaccine In Their Arm!” Biden, CA, NY Deliver Carefully Scripted Vaccine ‘Mandates’ In Plotted Plan",27 JUL 2021,8368,"The communist leftists controlling the country (aka deep state/China) are carrying out their carefully scripted plan to destroy your life, livelihood, and liberty. The latest action involved mandatory vaccinations, using a deadly and ineffective vaccine that causes serious health problems. Conservative Treehouse explained: It’s all a strategic Alinsky move once you connect the dots. Earlier today New York City Mayor De Blasio announced mandated vaccinations for all 340,000 city employees. Hours later Joe Biden announced mandatory vaccinations for all 115,000 front-line employees of The Veterans Affairs department. Immediately thereafter, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced all state employees and healthcare providers will be forced to vaccinate.  None of these events are disconnected. Keep in mind just a few days ago the Federal CDC announced all U.S. healthcare providers must switch to new rapid response tests for COVID-19.  The reasoning?  The current PCR test does not differentiate between COVID and the flu.  The new tests will distinguish between the flu virus and the COVID virus. Can you see the strategic move now? The new CDC approved rapid response test will cull the flu cases from false positives; that approach will automatically drop the number of new COVID cases identified.  The Biden regime will then say the drop in new COVID cases is because of the forced vaccinations in major populations (VA, NYC and CA).  As a result, everyone must get vaccinated because the added vaccinations are lowering the COVID cases, and the statistics will prove it. Can you see it now? This false assertion, driven by organized manipulation of events, will then increase pressure on the remaining public to get vaccinated. The drop in COVID positive cases will create the momentum for additional COVID vaccination mandates. If we thought the pressure to vaccinate is bad now, we haven’t seen anything yet.  It is going to get ugly, with threats of federal reimbursement dollars (medicare, medicaid, food and housing) withheld from states as leverage against Red State governors who do not mandate vaccinations.  Vaccination passports are a guarantee in this approach; possibly even federally mandated in order to “safely vote” in the 2022 mid-term election; and the unvaccinated fear will guarantee mail-in ballots again. Services will be determined by vaccination status, and as we have seen in the election reform and voting integrity debate – corporate America will line-up to support mandatory vaccinations for retail entry or use of their products (shopping, restaurants, etc.). On a federal level – just like the VA beta-test rolled out today, a vaccination status will be weaponized by federal regulatory agencies like OSHA, Dept of Labor, USDA, HHS, HUD, Dept of Agriculture, Dept of Education, etc. All of this will be politically pressurized for a Vaxxed -vs- Non Vaxxed mid term election in 2022. That’s the Alinsky play… Right now they are probing for reaction… That’s exactly what this looks like. Breitbart reported: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Monday said it is the community’s mission to get more people vaccinated, previewing his administration’s desire to knock on doors, put unvaccinated people in cars, and drive them to “get that vaccine in their arm.” “I wear a mask because I care about you. I get a vaccine because I care about you,” Cuomo said, framing compliance to various methods of government coercion as an expression of selflessness. “We understand that we are all in this together. We understand that as goes one goes all in this city where we all live together and in this state where we all live together,” he continued. “We have to get back to work. We have to get back to work, and we have to get back to work now, and we have to spread this message or we’re going to spread the virus,” he said before specifically expressing the desire to knock on doors and drive unvaccinated people to get the jab. “And we have to get in those communities, and we have to knock on those doors, and we have to convince people, and put them in a car and drive them and get that vaccine in their arm. That is the mission,” the Democrat mayor said during Monday’s press conference, where he announced the allocation of $15 million from the state’s budget to promote vaccinations. “COVID-19 exposed longstanding inequities in our society, and we’ve seen evidence of that in both the positivity rate and the vaccination rate in communities that were hardest hit by the virus,” Cuomo said in a statement, claiming the state is “pulling out all the stops to get shots in arms.” “This budget funding will help us target outreach efforts in the state’s most vulnerable communities to make sure that everyone is able to get vaccinated,” he continued, touting the “incredible progress” New York — once the U.S. epicenter of the Chinese coronavirus despite extended mask mandates and business restrictions — has made. “We’ve made incredible progress in the fight against COVID-19, but there’s more work to do, and this will help us protect communities across the state,” he added. Recent surveys suggest unvaccinated Americans remain firm in their decision not to get a coronavirus vaccine, and many of them cite concerns related to vaccine development, as well as worries over adverse side effects. As Breitbart News reported: Eighty-one percent of Americans who have not received the vaccine yet say they will “probably” or “definitely” not get the shot. Of those, 45 percent say they “definitely” will not, and 35 percent say they “probably” will not. On the flip side, 16 percent say they “probably” will get the jab, while just three percent say they “definitely” will, indicating that the vast majority of those who have yet to get the vaccine are solid in their decisions. “Now we need to go community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and often times door by door – literally knocking on doors to get help to the remaining people,” Biden said during a speech this month. White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated that outreach will include “targeted community by community, door to door outreach to get the remaining Americans vaccinated.” Over 163 million Americans are considered fully vaccinated, comprising 49.1 percent of the nation’s total population, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) July 26 data. National File explained: As National File reported, the CDC declared that it will withdraw its emergency use application for the controversial PCR tests on December 31, 2021, and is urging clinics and hospitals around the country to immediately begin the process of using new tools better able to “facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses” because “Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season.” It appears clinics will have a new choice for COVID-19 tests by time the PCR tests are phased out: Mologic, a company in the United Kingdom that manufactures COVID-19 tests and is expected to be purchased by a new initiative run by George Soros and Bill Gates, Global Access Health. Forbes explains that Global Access Health (GAH) is a joint initiative between “The Soros Economic Development Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation” and explains that Mologic Ltd is “best known today for the deep-nostril technology used to deliver rapid COVID-19 tests.” The partnership between Gates and Soros to buy this company was announced on Monday, July 19, and the CDC’s decision to phase out PCR tests was announced Saturday, July 24. The soon-to-be Soros and Gates funded tests apparently “offer an early-warning screening for Covid-19 and have been used around the world as an aid to help reopen shops, bars, sporting events and workplaces” and specialize in “giving an early warning result for people who may have no symptoms” but who scientists believe can still spread the virus. Bill Gates, the globalist titan who is currently in the process of divorcing his longtime wife Melinda Gates, drew international ire during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when he seemed to celebrate the spread of the virus, and smiled into the camera alongside his wife during an interview where he declared that “this won’t be the last pandemic we face.”"
Dem Demands “Reward and Punishment” System for Vaccinated Versus People Who Can Think,26 JUL 2021,1543,"Democrat rulers just can’t get past the idea that they are the masters, and know what’s best for their slaves. The Gateway Pundit explained: While appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that there needs to be a “reward-punishment system” to force people to get vaccinated. Emanuel said that people should not be able to participate in activities within society unless they take the rushed-out jabs. “There’s a lot of things we can do without calling it a mandate. Just make it almost impossible for people to live their lives without being protected and protect us,” panelist Margaret Hoover said. “I agree. I’m the son of a pediatrician…The fact is no child can show up at school without showing their immunizations, smallpox and measles. You have to make this familiar to people. Second is, I would close the space. If you want to participate in activities, you have to show you are vaccinated. So it becomes a reward-punishment system. You make your own calculation. The fact is there’s data this week that 30% of health care workers are not vaccinated,” Emanuel responded. “They have got to lead by example.” He added, “My own recommendation is the religious community ecumenically, across the board needs to speak up and encourage people. So you hit all populations with a singular message. I do give credit to the White House, whether it’s Fox TV or Republican leaders, getting a chorus of voices, across the spectrum, not just political, religious et cetera, with a singular message and lead by example.”"
‘Don’t Tell Your Parents’: Student Exposes CRT Secret In Minnesota Town,26 JUL 2021,3074,"In Minnesota, adults told children to keep ‘training’ they were being given in school from their parents… much like pedophilic predators do. Alpha News reported: Bipartisan grassroots campaigns pushing back against critical race theory (CRT) have occurred around America in 2021, from wealthy liberal enclaves to small Minnesota towns. At a school board meeting this week held in Sartell, just north of Saint Cloud, the dialogue surrounding CRT-influenced curricula continued. Community members again discussed Equity Alliance Minnesota (EAM), a left-wing group hired earlier this year for an $80,000 audit on “racial inequities” within the Sartell-St. Stephen School District. Students were required to complete a survey for the audit but weren’t allowed to discuss its contents with their parents, according to student Haylee Yasgar. “My teacher said that I could not skip any questions even when I didn’t understand them. One question asked us what gender we identify with. I was very confused along with a lot of other classmates,” Yasgar said during Monday night’s meeting. She said students were told they could not “repeat any of the questions to our parents.” “Being asked to hide this from my mom made me very uncomfortable, like I was doing something wrong,” she told the school board. Parents remain concerned that the district, knowingly or not, is pursuing CRT and putting politics over educating children. Despite the high school having ample space, a standing room crowd of more than 100 people crowded into the oldest gym in the district, a space lacking air conditioning on a hot evening and with poor audio. Some in the audience felt board members struggled to consistently allot time to various speakers. Defenders of the audit aimed their claims at enforcing anti-bullying rules and combating mental health issues. They did not specifically reference CRT. “Bullying is going unchecked because discipline isn’t there, since the audit is taking away money and time from mental health issues,” Chris Yasgar, who’s leading a group of parents opposing the audit, claimed in response. “CRT advocates pretend the debate is about teaching racism and slavery. It’s designed to do the opposite. I think it’s a sign of their position’s weakness that they keep returning to this line.” Yasgar spoke at Monday’s meeting and said several teachers in the district support his cause but fear retaliation from school administrators. “My first question for you tonight surrounds the topic of data requests. We have data requests that are now weeks old, weeks, that have gone unanswered,” Yasgar said, referring to his request for a copy of the survey students were required to complete. A Facebook group, Concerned Parents and Community of ISD 748, now has more than 1,000 members. A new website dedicated to putting students over politics is also active. Yasgar will return to Saint Cloud’s KNSI Radio next week, accompanied by David Switzer, an economics professor at St. Cloud State University, who recently analyzed and made recommendations about the flawed EAM audit."
Dangerous Drug Resistant Fungus Found In US,23 JUL 2021,1820,"The CDC is now claiming that a drug-resistant fungus has entered the US. Many people wonder firstly if this is simply another democrat manufactured crisis, or secondly, if not, did the hordes of illegals pouring in bring it? The Gateway Pundit reported: A dangerous fungus resistant to all drugs was identified in two cities, Washington DC and Dallas, Texas.
The fungus was first identified in Asia. (Now where have we heard this before?) The fungus is dangerous to hospital and nursing home patients. It is most deadly when it enters the bloodstream. Stat News reported: For the first time ever, researchers have reported cases of people carrying or infected with strains of the dangerous fungus Candida auris that were resistant to all classes of antifungal drugs before any treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. The agency also reported evidence of some transmission of the strains within health facilities. Candida auris, or C. auris, which was first seen in 2009, has been highly resistant to the few available treatment options for several years, leaving people who treat and study fungal diseases concerned about the toll this superbug could take, particularly on severely ill patients. That there are now so-called pan-resistant cases in people who had never been treated with antifungal drugs is particularly unnerving, experts said. The CDC reported on five cases, three in Washington, D.C., and two in Texas. In both locations, the cases were clustered within facilities. The facilities were not identified, but the fungus is most commonly diagnosed in very sick people who are in specialized long-term facilities. The CDC reported that Candida auris is an emerging fungus that presents a serious global health threat. CDC is concerned about C. auris for three main reasons:"
"Michigan Corruption: Local Board Gives ‘First Responder’ Relief, Fails To Mention Board Got $25K Each",23 JUL 2021,4000,"In one county in Michigan, the Board of Commissioners decided to pay ‘first responders’ some relief funds… but failed to mention that they paid themselves each $25,000. MLive reported: Members of the Shiawassee County Board of Commissioners agreed to share a windfall in federal COVID-19 relief funds with employees last week. What they didn’t tell the public was that top-level administrators for the county would receive far bigger payments — up to $25,000 each — than front-line workers who were directly exposed to coronavirus as they cleaned buildings and provided vaccines to residents. Records obtained by MLive-The Flint Journal show “top-level administrators” in the county received $25,000 each from the COVID-19 relief funds awarded to the county while department heads each received $12,500. “Middle management” officials received $5,000 each while chief deputies, Health Department employees, and attorneys received $2,500. The breakdown written by County Coordinator Brian Boggs shows employees identified as “cleaning staff” received $2,000 each and all other employees received $1,000. “It’s a sad day … I feel badly,” said Commissioner Marlene Webster, a Republican who represents a portion of the city of Owosso. “It’s a blow to county workers’ morale at a time when it’s difficult to keep good workers … I think (it shows) a serious lack of acknowledgment of what people did (during the pandemic).” Like other commissioners at the county board meeting Thursday, July 15, Webster voted to provide hazard pay to county employees with part of the federal relief funds provided as a part of the American Rescue Plan signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this year. The vote to do so after a closed session of the commissioners didn’t provide a break down of which employees would receive how much hazard pay or if county commissioners would receive the extra payments. Webster said she learned commissioners, who are paid just $10,000 annually plus stipends for meeting attendance, were included in the payments only after a deposit showed in her banking account from the county on Monday. The commissioner said she’s since learned that county board Chairman Jeremy R. Root was paid $25,000, Commissioners John B. Plowman and Brandon Marks received $10,000, and the remaining four commissioners were each given $5,000. “I’m mortified. I never would have voted to give myself more than the average (employee) — if anything,” Webster said Tuesday, July 20. The commissioner said she intends to give back the hazard pay she was awarded but said she’s not certain the distribution of the federal funds to employees can be reversed by the county board. The Journal could not immediately reach Boggs or Root for comment on the hazard pay payments Tuesday, but the county coordinator cited state and federal guidelines in response to questions from Webster this week. The guidelines say the COVID-19 relief funds can be used to provide additional pay of up to $13 an hour for employees with a maximum of $25,000 per person. Commissioner Cindy L. Garber, who received a $5,000 payment, said Tuesday that she has no intention of returning the money she was granted, saying it pales in comparison to the additional money hourly employees were able to make during the pandemic by collecting unemployment while they were laid off one day per week. Garber said she continued to work for the county in person as coronavirus raged in Michigan during 2020 and earlier this year. The $25,000 payment to Root was justified, she said, because he “bears the burden of all emergency orders.” “That is no small responsibility,” said Garber, who accused Webster of “crying like a teenage girl” about the distribution. “I am going to follow (President Biden’s) advice and spend the money. That’s what it’s for … stimulate the economy,” she said. The Journal could not immediately reach a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Treasury for comment on the hazard pay distribution in Shiawassee County."
50 Fully Vaccinated Residents In New Jersey Dead,23 JUL 2021,1738,"In New Jersey, 50 people who were ‘fully vaccinated’ using the experimental and ineffective COVID vax are now dead. The Hill explained: New Jersey health officials say that almost 50 fully vaccinated people have died from COVID-19, according to data through July 12, NJ Advance Media reported on Wednesday. Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, told the news outlet that all 49 people who died were over 50 years old. Thirty were over 80 years old, 13 people were between 65 and 79 years old, and six were between 50 and 64 years old. Leusner also said many of the people who died had preexisting conditions. Seventeen people had cardiovascular disease, nine had cancer or other conditions that compromised their immune systems and seven had diabetes, the news outlet reported. Others had chronic conditions in the lungs, kidney and liver. The number of vaccinated people who have died from COVID-19 represents a slight uptick since New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) announced on Monday that 31 inoculated people had died from the coronavirus, according to NJ Advance Media. Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious diseases expert, has mentioned that breakthrough cases among fully vaccinated people is inevitable but has stressed that more than 99 percent of those who died from COVID-19 in June were not vaccinated. In mid-June, New Jersey reported that 4.7 million people – or 70 percent of the state’s adult population – were fully vaccinated, hitting the goal about two weeks earlier than expected, ABC 7 New York reported. About 5.1 million people are fully vaccinated in the state. According to data from John Hopkins University, the state has reported deaths in the single digits since early June."
CDC ‘Monitoring’ Monkey Pox Outbreak In 27 States,21 JUL 2021,4071,"Apparently, thanks to one person who traveled from Nigeria to Texas, the CDC is monitoring a Monkey Pox outbreak. Stat News reported: More than 200 people in 27 states are being monitored for possible exposure to monkeypox after they had contact with an individual who contracted the disease in Nigeria before traveling to the United States this month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To date, no additional cases have been detected. State and local health authorities are working with the CDC to identify and assess the individuals, and follow up with them daily until late this month, said Andrea McCollum, who leads the poxvirus epidemiology unit at the agency’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. “It is a lot of people,” McCollum acknowledged. The efforts stem from the discovery that a U.S. resident infected with monkeypox traveled from Lagos, Nigeria, on an overnight flight to Atlanta that arrived on July 9; the person then traveled the same day to Dallas. On July 15, the individual sought care at a Dallas hospital emergency room, where the diagnosis of monkeypox was made. The people being monitored include a number who sat within 6 feet of the infected individual on the Lagos to Atlanta flight; others who used the mid-cabin bathroom on that flight; airline workers who cleaned the bathroom after the flight; flight attendants; and some family members who had contact with the individual in Dallas. Passengers on the Atlanta-Dallas flight with indirect contact — in other words, those sitting near the infected person — were deemed to have had too short an exposure to be at risk, said McCollum. “We define indirect contact as being within 6 feet of the patient in the absence of an N-95 or any filtering respirator for greater than or equal to three hours,” she said. Monkeypox is caused by a virus that is related to smallpox, the only human virus to have been eradicated. It causes less severe illness than smallpox, but is still quite dangerous. The CDC said that the fatality rate for the strain of monkeypox seen in the Dallas case is about 10%. Monkeypox is rarely seen in people. There was a large outbreak in the U.S. in 2003, when a shipment of animals from Ghana contained several rodents and other small mammals that were infected with the virus; 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in five states. The outbreak was the first time human cases of monkeypox were reported outside of Africa. In the past few years, Nigeria has seen an uptick of monkeypox cases and seven exported cases have now been detected: four in the United Kingdom and one apiece in Singapore, Israel, and the United States. In one of the importation events in the U.K., a local health care worker was infected after having unprotected contact with the patient. The original source or sources of the monkeypox virus have not been identified, though cases have been linked to the handling of bushmeat and the trade of exotic small mammals, McCollum said. The disease triggers fever, chills, swollen glands, and a characteristic rash that is disseminated across the body, including on the palms of hands and the soles of feet. The virus spreads through a variety of ways: inhalation of respiratory droplets from infected people or contact with their lesions or bodily fluids. The virus can also be transmitted by having contact with bed linens or other items that have been used by an infected person, McCollum said. The incubation period for monkeypox — the time from exposure to symptoms — can be anywhere from three to 17 days, though the CDC has asked state and local health authorities to monitor the identified people for 21 days, a period that ends on July 30. Most people who contract monkeypox do so within five to 13 days, which means if additional cases are found, they will likely start to show symptoms soon. “We’re in the time frame where we certainly want to closely monitor people,” McCollum said.

"Criminal Referral! Rand Paul Takes On Nervous, Lying Fauci: It’s A Crime To Lie To Congress!",21 JUL 2021,7785,"Anthony Fauci was sweating and nervous about his part in the death of millions. Conservative Treehouse reported: Kentucky Senator Dr. Rand Paul confronted the Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, about previous lies to congress when Fauci said the National Institute of Health (NIH) was not funding “gain of function” (weaponization) research in the Wuhan Laboratories.   The Wuhan Lab is likely the originating source of SARS-CoV-2 virus commonly known as COVID-19.  Current indications are that U.S. funds helped create the virus that has now become a global pandemic killing hundreds-of-thousands.  As a consequence, Anthony Fauci is increasingly becoming the target of scrutiny for his lies, falsehoods and misleading statements as he attempts to slip away from accountability. In this confrontation, a very nervous and guilt-ridden Fauci attempts to parse terms to avoid admitting he is the man who has killed many.  His nervous, arrogant and combative posture is on display. Ego-maniacal Fauci previously proclaimed that “any attacks against him” -based on his lies, fraud, deception and manipulation- are “attacks on the very basis of science itself”. Now that we know the Obama administration was directly involved in the creation of SARS-CoV-2 as a biological weapon that was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China (an accidental or purposeful release still undetermined) {Go Deep}, we have the background to understand why the JoeBama administration has to defend Anthony Fauci. All of the originating activity surrounding U.S. collaboration with the Wuhan Institute, the funding of the Wuhan Institute and the approvals for the Wuhan Institute to conduct “gain of function” research (weaponizing the virus), took place during the Obama administration.  Including the events on January 9, 2017, eleven days before leaving office, when President Obama’s administration lifted the funding moratorium to weaponize SARS bat viruses. The bigger question of why the U.S. would fund, support and facilitate the creation of a biological weapon by the Chinese, is where things really get interesting.  The only reason the Pentagon (U.S. Military) would enjoin that relationship with China would be to benefit their own interests. What interests would the U.S. military and U.S. Intelligence hold in the creation of a biological weapon in China? What is it that they say about “means”, “motive”, and “opportunity”? The most likely answer is the one that makes people very uncomfortable. ♦ MEANS:  The U.S. military and larger intelligence network likely used Wuhan as a cover for their own operations and intents. If the political elements in the intelligence community, working in coordination with the U.S. military, were involved in a purposeful leak from a biological weapons facility in North Carolina – there would be a trail of evidence that could expose their activity. However, if they move that activity to Wuhan, China, the plausible deniability is much stronger. Additionally, while the COVID targets made up a very specific demographic group most at risk of death from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it’s likely the vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus was known to both the Chinese communists and U.S. intelligence community before the release. ♦ MOTIVE: The U.S. and China working together on the planned weaponization and release of the virus just makes sense.  Both nations would stand to gain the benefit from the biological release, because President Donald J Trump’s “America First” program was working against both their interests. Stand back and look at the BIG PICTURE.  The successful global trade reset underway by the Trump administration, in combination with success in the creation of peace in both the Middle-east (Abraham Accords) and in North Korea (unification of both Koreas), was directly against the interests of the Chinese Government and U.S. military. On top of all those motives, the global multinational corporations and banks were financially being impacted by all of President Trump’s domestic and foreign policies. Yeah, “there are trillions at stake”! ♦ OPPORTUNITY:  No, Dr. Anthony Fauci didn’t need to know about all those background motives and agendas in order to carry out his part.  Fauci need only be some sick, twisted little man who wanted desperately to be the center of attention amid the global scientific community of his peers, and have his name adored in all the history books. “It must be understood that what is meant by “political violence” is in fact lèse majesté.  10,000 proles can die and who in DC would miss them? But track mud on their carpet, and such an insult cannot go unanswered.” ~ Source
 The COVID-19 narrative becomes a tool to achieve a variety of objectives: • The stalling of a fantastic economy that was benefiting every American voter. • Mail-in ballots that can be used and manipulated to achieve fraudulent results. • Controls over debates to avoid a weak candidate being exposed or confronted. • The deployed ‘excuse‘ for a very visible lack of voter enthusiasm for the puppet (Biden).  In short, without COVID as a tool, the manufactured election process is more difficult. The ‘never let a crisis go to waste‘ strategy includes the necessary creation of a crisis. Carry on…. The Gateway Pundit added: Senator Dr. Rand Paul (R-KY) ripped arrogant Fauci during Tuesday’s hearing on the nation’s Covid response efforts. Fauci testified and responded to questions about the NIH’s role in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab. Rand Paul and Fauci got into a tense exchange over Fauci’s involvement in funding the Wuhan lab’s gain-of-function research that likely led to Covid-19. Fauci AGAIN denied he funded gain-of-function research. “There will be responsibility for those who funded the lab, including yourself.” Rand Paul said. “I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating, Senator.” Fauci retorted. As The Gateway Pundit has reported since early 2020, the Wuhan lab was likely the source of the coronavirus outbreak and Dr. Fauci was funding the lab for years. Dr. Fauci refuted the claims under oath despite the fact that there are documents that prove the US was funding the Wuhan lab under his direction. The Gateway Pundit reported: Senator Rand Paul Tuesday night said he is sending a letter to the Department of Justice asking for a criminal referral into Dr. Fauci. Earlier Tuesday Rand Paul ripped arrogant Fauci during a hearing on the nation’s Covid response efforts. Fauci testified and responded to questions about the NIH’s role in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab. Rand Paul and Fauci got into a tense exchange over Fauci’s involvement in funding the Wuhan lab’s gain-of-function research that likely led to Covid-19. Fauci AGAIN denied he funded gain-of-function research. Rand Paul also warned Fauci that lying to Congress is a crime. “Dr. Fauci, as you are aware it is a crime to lie to Congress, Section 1001 of the US Criminal Code. Critics say a felony and a five-year penalty for lying to Congress,” Rand Paul said. Senator Paul is following through with his threats and said he will be criminally referring Fauci to the Justice Department.

Soros and Gates Team Up To Buy COVID Vaccine,20 JUL 2021,4344,"In what can only be described as a nightmare for the masses, vaccine murderer Bill Gates is teaming up with George Soros to purchase a COVID testing company and maker of the deadly vaccine. Forbes explained: Billionaires George Soros and Bill Gates are part of a consortium set to buy Mologic, a U.K.-based maker of Covid tests, in an effort to increase access to “affordable state-of-the-art medical technology” around the world, according to a statement released Monday. The Soros Economic Development Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced the launch of a new initiative, Global Access Health (GAH), aiming to strengthen the global rollout saving medical technology and the subsequent acquisition of Mologic Ltd, best known today for the deep-nostril technology used to deliver rapid Covid-19 tests. The technology can also be used to test for dengue, bilharzia and river blindness. The rapid so-called lateral flow tests offer an early-warning screening for Covid-19 and have been used around the world as an aid to help reopen shops, bars, sporting events and workplaces by giving an early warning result for people who may have no symptoms but are still infectious and can give the virus to others. In the U.K., lateral flow Covid tests need to be confirmed by a second test before Covid-19 is officially diagnosed. The GAH consortium, which includes Soros’ and Gates’ philanthropic arms, will invest “at least” $41 million in this deal, according to the statement. ‘Unique Transaction’ Soros and Gates are part of the billionaire community looking to direct their philanthropic efforts to the so-called global south, referring broadly to the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania that many fear will be left behind as the more affluent West accelerates its program of vaccinations, testing and biosecure bubbles in the years ahead. Sean Hinton, the CEO of the Soros fund, said in a statement that the pandemic has “painfully demonstrated the fundamental inequities” in global public health, adding that this “unique transaction” has brought philanthropic funds and investors together to address the issue. Roxana Bonnell, a public health expert from Soros’ Open Society Foundations, which claims to be the world’s largest private funder of human rights and social justice advocacy groups, said, “As we have seen during the Covid-19 pandemic, access to testing is absolutely essential when it comes to containing the spread of contagious disease—an issue that ultimately affects us all.” Mologic Flow Mologic was founded in 2003 as a for-profit medical research and innovation laboratory by CEO Mark Davis and his father, Paul Davis, who is Mologic’s chief scientific officer. Paul Davis is also known as the inventor of another world-famous medical technology: the Clearblue pregnancy test, which first launched in 1988. The pregnancy test was the world’s first commercial application of lateral flow technology, the company claims. Mologic has worked with Gates’ philanthropic arm in the past. In 2016, Mologic established the Center for Advanced Rapid Diagnostics (CARD) with the backing of a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, focusing on lowering the cost of rapid-delivery healthcare. On Sunday, London’s Financial Times reported on the threat of the Delta variant in countries like South Africa, where the variant now accounts for around 95% of cases in a country that has less than 3% of people vaccinated. Meanwhile the U.S. and Europe have made big strides in vaccinating their populations and significantly reducing the likelihood of hospitalization or severe symptoms following a positive Covid-19 test. The World Health Organization reported last week that Africa had recorded a 43% week-on-week rise in Covid-19 deaths, adding that only 18 million people in Africa are fully vaccinated, representing 1.5% of the continent’s population. Another surge of infections is likely coming. Fatima Hassan, founder of South Africa’s Health Justice Initiative, tweeted on Sunday: “We need more supplies, and fast.” Nothing to see here, nothing at all. Let’s move on.  ‘Billionaire philanthropists George Soros and Bill Gates are part of a buyout of Bedford based developer of lateral flow tests….’https://t.co/Ef2qY4GbYs pic.twitter.com/c2ogjoZfMH — Sandra Weeden (@SandraWeeden) July 19, 2021"
Video: Dr. Issues Dire Warning Why The COVID Vaccine Causes Blood Clots,20 JUL 2021,1919,"One physician is explaining the real science behind the COVID virus and the experimental vaccine and is begging people not to take it. Armstrong Economics reported: Professor Bhakdi refers to new studies published by The Lancet which show that this is not such an unusual virus that the body does not recognize. It responds to the virus quickly showing vaccination is not necessary. Corona Viruses are different from Influenza and Bacteria or a Fungus. While I believe this virus was created in a lab, it is still a Coronavirus and it is not that dangerous to the majority of the population – the elderly yes, because their immune systems are starting to fail which eventually allows us to pass on to another dimension. Meanwhile, a serious number of doctors and lawyers are filing lawsuits for violating the Nuremberg Codes and conducting experimental vaccines on humans. Resistance is not futile, but our problem is the extent of the corruption which has consumed politicians worldwide. I cannot stress enough that this virus has been DELIBERATELY called a pandemic for political and economic reasons – not health. The lockdowns are absurd and the destruction to the world economy is intended to set the stage for Schwab’s Great Reset – Build Back Better which is the slogan created by the World Economic Forum and adopted by world leaders. The fact that Biden will not even investigate more consider firing Fauci proves one point – this is a political agenda and has nothing to do with health. They are seeking to change the world monetary system because it is collapsing. I have argued until my voice has failed. There were solutions available that retained our liberty. The problem was, the governments would lose power. Their choice is to retain power by moving to a totalitarian state and end our human rights as we have known them. Even Fauci has openly said – he is not concerned about our liberty. WATCH HERE."
"Whistleblower Says 45,000 Dead From COVID Vaccine, 60% Of New Cases Fully Vaccinated",20 JUL 2021,5606,"According to a whistleblower, at least 45,000 people are dead because of the experimental COVID vaccine. And in England, over 60 percent of new hospitalized cases of COVID are people who have taken the vaccine, leading many people to wonder about the push to jab the masses. The Gateway Pundit reported: 60% of people being admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 in England are fully vaccinated, Sky News reported. According to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific advisor, Covid patients have received two doses of the Covid vaccine. “In terms of the number of people in hospital who’ve been double-vaccinated, we know it’s around 60% of the people being admitted to hospital with COVID,” Vallance said. “We do expect there to be over 1,000 people per day being hospitalized with coronavirus because of the increase in infections,” he added. “But the rates should be lower than they have been previously because of the protective effects of vaccination.” Vallance continued to defend the dangerous, ineffective and experimental Covid vaccines. “They’re very, very effective, but not 100%, and as a higher proportion of the population is double-vaccinated, it’s inevitable that those 10% of that very large number remain at risk, and therefore will be amongst the people who both catch the infection and end up in hospital.” Sir Patrick Vallance says about 60% of COVID cases in hospitals now have had two vaccinations. But he says this is “not surprising” because a higher proportion of the population have had two jabs, and the jabs are not “100% effective”.

Hal Turner Radio wrote: 45,000 people have allegedly died from the Covid-19 vaccine within three days, according to a US whistle-blower, which has sparked a lawsuit against the federal government. Thomas Renz, an attorney based in Ohio has started a lawsuit against the federal government for covering up the true number of deaths from the Covid-19 vaccines. According to Renz, a whistle-blower – referred to as Jane Doe – who is an insider and has seen information on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) allegedly passed on the numbers and relevant information to him.
At an event hosted by Awaken America, Renz said: “We have someone that has sworn under penalty of perjury that there have been at least 45,000 deaths.” Allegedly, the whistleblower stated that there are around 11 VAERS systems reporting adverse reactions and deaths across the US, and one system alone has allegedly has reported the shocking 45,000 deaths from the Covid jabs. However, Renz believes that this number is “immensely higher” and is calling for immediate investigations into the VAERS system. “How many have really died and why are they covering it up?”, Renz told the Awaken America crowd. The attorney said that this information and lawsuit will not be reported by the mainstream media and will likely be censored by big tech corporations like YouTube, Facebook, and Google. Renz said that these big tech giants are “complicit in causing death”, and that he cannot wait to sue them “over and over again.”
Through his Ohio-based law firm, Renz Law, Thomas is suing the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to halt the Covid-19 vaccine rollout to children 15-years-old and younger. The lawsuit was filed by Renz and his legal team alongside America’s Frontline Doctors against the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Covid-19 vaccines, which they state have had “no long-term studies on the impact on adults, much less children.” Furthermore, the lawsuit challenges the legality of EUA as the law states that children must be at risk, which Renz argues that the “CDC state that children are statistically at ZERO percent mortality rate by Covid-19.” Recent data from VAERS up to the week of July 2nd showed that 29.5% of all reported deaths in the US following the administration of the Covid-19 over the last six months and two weeks occurred in the last week. The data showed that between December 14th, 2020, and July 2nd, 2021, a total of 438,441 adverse events were reported to VAERS, including 9,048 deaths. Compared to the previous week, this was an increase of 2,063 deaths. However, it is known that only 1% of adverse reactions are reported, as a report commissioned by the US Department of Health stated that: “Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but under-reported. “Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.” Therefore, it is worth noting that the adverse reaction statistics are already inaccurate as not every person who has an adverse event reports it to the relevant system. However, the question still remains as to the number of reactions and deaths which may not be released to the public by the likes of VAERS and the UK’s Yellow Card reporting system."
Whitmer Just Lost Her Emergency ‘Powers’ And Can’t Veto The Bill,19 JUL 2021,2883,"Gretchen Whitmer just lost the tyrannical power over her slave-citizens. The Epoch Times explained: Michigan’s Senate on Thursday approved a petition that repeals Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s emergency powers, with another approval expected by the state’s lower chamber. Whitmer, a Democrat, cannot veto the petition. The Michigan Senate’s 20-15 vote came two days after the Board of State Canvassers certified the petition, which was started by a group called Unlock Michigan that gathered over 340,000 signatures. The board deadlocked 2-2 in April but voted 3-0 this time around. The petition took aim at the 1945 Emergency Powers Act that enabled Whitmer to impose harsh restrictions on state residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans on the Senate floor before the vote praised the petition and said it was needed to curb Whitmer’s power. “This initiative represents a people’s veto of this governor and the unlimited power that she’s tried to claim during this pandemic,” state Sen. Tom Barrett, a Republican, told colleagues. Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, another Republican, said the petition “doesn’t take power away” but “reassesses where the power belongs.” Democrats offered different explanations for their “no” votes. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat, argued that the legislature is “a deliberatively slow-moving body.” “But when an emergency faces our state, we don’t have the luxury of time. That is what this legislature of the past put into place. And I could not in good conscience support or measure to remove those powers and put future residents at risk if the executive of the state does not have the ability to act quickly,” she said. A Whitmer spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. A Michigan House of Representatives GOP spokesman told news outlets that the chamber will vote on the petition soon. If it does not within approximately one month, or if the vote fails, then voters will decide on whether to repeal the emergency powers law in the next election. Republicans control both chambers of the legislature in Michigan. If the House follows the Senate, then an emergency declaration will be good for 28 days before requiring the legislature’s approval to be extended. The vote on Thursday came after a series of developments, including a ruling by the Michigan Supreme Court that the emergency powers law was unconstitutional. The court later ordered the Board of State Canvassers to certify the petition after the board deadlocked along party lines, with Republicans voting for and Democrats against, in April. Unlock Michigan, meanwhile, received approval this week for a new petition that would limit emergency powers for the Michigan Department of Health. Unlock Michigan spokesperson Fred Wzolek told The Epoch Times that the petition was “another step to keep Whitmer from ruling by decree on her own.”"
"Congress Is Sneaking Immigration ‘Reform’ Into Budget, No GOP Votes Required",19 JUL 2021,4174,"In a sneaky and underhanded way (like everything democrat communists do), congress is preparing to pass a budget bill that ensures illegal aliens will help increase the dwindling coffer of democrat voters. Just the News explained: Expected to be included in the Congressional Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill is language that will advance the party’s goals for immigration reform. Working with the White House, a group of top Capitol Hill Democrats are workshopping placing a handful of immigration measures into the spending bill that will likely be passed via budget reconciliation, that is with no Republican support. For years, efforts to reform the American immigration system have stalled as Democrats and Republicans fail to make any sort of meaningful bipartisan progress on the issue. Now, Democrats are opting to strategically move forward potentially without the need for bipartisan agreement. As Democrats in Washington scramble to complete the full version of the so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill ahead of an initial procedural vote next Wednesday, details of the massive spending plan meant to accompany the infrastructure legislation are nowhere near fleshed-out, including how they plan to insert immigration policy into a spending bill. Right now, Democrats are, according to Politico, employing a “trial-and-error” approach to the legislation. Democrats are reportedly attempting to include pathways to citizenship for a number of illegal immigrant groups in the bill, including “dreamers,” who came or were brought to the United States as minors, and farmworkers already living and working in the country. The Hispanic Caucus is also lobbying to include giving out green cards to “essential workers,” including those who work on the frontlines of health professions during the pandemic, as part of the legislation. It is not clear that the Democrats will be able to include all, or any, of these measures in the final framework of the bill, if they wish to pass it without Republican support. There will likely be a lively back-and-forth with the Senate parliamentarian (who happens to be a former immigration lawyer) regarding what immigration policy can, under the complex and sometimes obscure rules of the Senate, be included in the budget. To qualify for Senate passage with a simple majority vote, which the $3.5 trillion package theoretically will, any given part of it must directly relate to federal revenue. It remains to be seen how Democrats will retrofit their immigration goals to meet the standards of the Senate rules in that regard. In February, Congressional Democrats and the Biden administration were denied the opportunity by the Senate parliamentarian, to include a proposal that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour in the American Rescue Plan. Senate Democrats leading the effort, including Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Robert Menendez (N.J.), and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) have developed a new strategy this time: being nicer to the parliamentarian, who is ultimately an apolitical third party. In February, she was subjected to ruthless attacks across online platforms, with some angry progressives going so far as to tweet out her personal cell phone number. Republicans are already voicing strong opposition to the Democrats’ tenuous plan. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) cautioned, “Democrats are trying to sneak mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants through Congress under the cover of their budget scheme.” Arkansas GOP Senator Tom Cotton echoed the sentiment, arguing that the proposal will act “as a bigger magnet for more illegal immigration into this country.” Without much of a mandate in either chamber and upcoming midterm elections that could potentially be a difficult one for the party in power, D.C. Democrats are currently throwing everything they’ve got at the wall and seeing what sticks, in an effort to get some significant, Biden-approved legislation through before this Congress is up. “We have had an every-which-way approach to immigration reform,” said Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), the leader of the Hispanic Caucus. This is currently our best effort.”"
Biden Regime’s ‘Ministry Of Truth’: Claims ’12 People’ Spreading ‘Disinformation’ As FB Posts ‘Censored’,16 JUL 2021,4599,"The White House is taking an active role in silencing all dissenters, admitting that (what can only be called the Ministry of Truth) they are ‘flagging problematic posts.’ In other words, controlling any speech that doesn’t conform to their communist narrative about the deadly COVID vaccines. Conservative Treehouse explained: Imagine apoplexy in media if President Trump’s White House was flagging content on Facebook for removal.  That’s exactly what White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki admitted today: “We are flagging problematic posts for Facebook“… Yup, the Biden regime is monitoring social media from the White House and identifying content they do not like.  Then, they flag that content and send it to Facebook, who then take action to remove it. On the upside – this is a direct admission the U.S. government is the determining voice on speech.  That admission now makes this a FIRST AMENDMENT issue. Previously the Democrats, leftists, media allies and the Biden administration all said Big Tech censorship, the banning of conservative voices/opinions, was a matter of private businesses making decisions on their own without government influence and therefore no ‘First Amendment’ issues are in place.  This admission from the White House today is exactly the opposite.   Let the lawsuits commence. “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” -Aristotle Disinformation or Misinformation doesn’t exist – there is just information that you accept, and information that you do not accept. You were not born with the requirement to believe everything you are told. Rather, you were born with a brain that allows you to process the information you receive. The Biden Administration is actively monitoring social media while the Trump Administration was banned from social media… The world has gone nuts. Conservative Treehouse reported: Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, Vice Admiral, U.S. Public Health Service Surgeon General of the United States, has produced new guidance to combat “misinformation” about health guidance as provided by the U.S. Government.  [pdf Here]  Comrades, the ‘Ministry of Truth’ is becoming very real. The government push to promote vaccinations for COVID-19 has gone well beyond reasonable advancement for the public health.  Now, we are entering a phase where the ongoing demand is becoming problematic, propaganda.  More government advocates are pushing toward mandatory vaccinations for a virus that has 99.9% survival rate. If you stand back – the scale of the demand far exceeds the known risk from the virus itself…. things just don’t add up. Additionally, the alliance between government and Big Tech is becoming increasingly worrisome.  Now the surgeon general is asking Big Tech to get even more involved and start pushing even more consequences for those who ask reasonable questions and are righteously skeptical of the government position. In a 22-page publication intended to allow only one standard for acceptable discussion as sanctioned by the U.S. government, the Surgeon General tells Big Tech what to do: “Prioritize early detection of misinformation “super-spreaders” and repeat offenders. Impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies.” (page 12) In other words, silence the opposition.  The Government will be the “single source of truth“. Emerald Robinson has adequately summed up this moment in history: “What you are witnessing now: the corrupt political elites in Western countries attempting to end representative democracy as we know it. Mandatory vaccination. Mandatory vaccine passports. The restriction of free speech. Mass warrantless surveillance. Mass illegal migration.” I can’t find any evidence that Ms. Robinson is wrong. The Gateway Pundit added: Stolen elections have consequences. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday casually admitted the federal government is censoring American citizens. “We’ve increased disinformation research and tracking within the Surgeon General’s office,” Psaki said. “We’re flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.” This is a clear violation of the First Amendment, but we are living in a lawless banana republic. The Biden regime is not only censoring social media posts, they are calling on SMS carriers to “fact-check” text messages in an effort to stop ‘misinformation’ about the Covid-19 vaccine. The Biden regime and its Democrat allies are going to monitor private communications to “dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages.”"
Memphis St. Jude’s Hospital Orders Mandatory Vaccines Or Employees Terminated,16 JUL 2021,1378,"Apparently, the fact that there’s a CURE for COVID means nothing. Global entities are forging toward mandatory vaccines across the world, and it’s happening in the United States. Local Action News reported: MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) – St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis is now requiring employees to get vaccinated against coronavirus or be terminated. A letter was sent to all employees Wednesday afternoon from President and CEO Dr. James Downing, outlining the new mandatory vaccine policy. In the letter, Downing cites the dangers of the Delta variant and its rapid spread as part of the reason for the mandate. St. Jude employees must be vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 9, barring a medical or religious exemption. The eight weeks between now and then is meant to give employees time to schedule and complete the vaccination process. Any employee who refuses to get vaccinated will be put on unpaid leave for two weeks. At the end of that time, if employees have not started the vaccination process, they will be terminated. Downing says the requirement is meant to ensure that St. Jude patients and their families are treated in the safest environment possible. Read the letter here. Here’s a copy of the letter sent to St. Jude employees about #COVID19 vaccines being required now:https://t.co/eYOv3DWxVT — Joyce Peterson (@MemphoNewsLady) July 15, 2021"
"LA Reinstates Mask Mandate For All, Even Vaccinated",16 JUL 2021,5475,"In Los Angeles, indoor mask mandates have been reinstated, despite the fact that masks don’t work. In fact, the move showcases the fact that the vaccines don’t work either, since masks will be required for all, including the ‘vaccinated.’ The move shows that COVID is about power and removing rights… not health. The Gateway Pundit explained: Los Angeles County on Thursday announced it is reimposing its indoor mask mandate regardless of vaccination status. The new mask mandate will go into effect at 11:59 on Saturday night, July 17th. The so-called “experts” started panicking this week because of 406 Covid hospitalizations in Los Angeles County. There are 10 million people in Los Angeles County and health officials are reimposing the mask mandate over 400 hospitalizations. Embattled Governor Gavin Newsom begged Californians to get vaccinated during a presser in Bell Gardens on Wednesday. “I cannot impress upon you more the power of getting vaccinated,” Newsom said. “If we. want to extinguish this pandemic, this disease, we’ve got to get vaccinated. Period. Full stop. You’re seeing again around the rest of the world, read the headlines in Indonesia right now. Read the headlines in Portugal right now. Read the headlines in the United States of America right now.” The new mask mandate in Los Angeles County is not going to help Gavin Newsom as he faces a recall election this September. Deadline ‘reported’: “This is an all hands on deck moment,” said Los Angeles County Public Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis. “We’re seeing the rates go up too high. We all need to do our part to try and prevent the need to do something else.” In light of those factors, Davis announced on Thursday that the county was again issuing a health officer order requiring all residents to wear masks in indoor public spaces. The order will go into effect at 11:59 p.m. this Saturday. He said the order, which he himself is responsible for signing, “will be similar” to masking requirements the county had in place before its June 15 reopening. Sacramento-area health officials announced a similar order earlier in the day. Asked if there is potential for further restrictions Davis said, “Everything is on the table if things continue to get worse. The next level is ‘High Transmission,’ and that’s not a place that we want be. We can’t wait for this to go higher before we act.” The Health Officer walked through L.A.’s most recent numbers and noted that the county’s case rate per 100,000 people is now 7.1. That puts the region in the “Substantial” category of spread, according to the CDC. (It’s worth noting that 7.1 would also put L.A. in the same category of Governor Gavin Newsom’s onetime Blueprint for a Safer Economy tiers, which ended on June 15.) The mandate means all customers will again be required to mask up when entering any indoor public establishment, including retail shops, grocery stores, restaurants and workplaces. Davis said indoor dining will remain open, but customers will have to remain masked while they are not eating or drinking. The more transmissible Delta variant is now 71% of all sequences in L.A. County, said Davis. Given that, the fact that slightly under 4 million of L.A.’s residents remain completely unvaccinated makes the potential for spread high. While 61% of county residents over 16 are vaccinated, 13% of the county’s population is under 12 and so not eligible for inoculation. In fact, when the county’s entire 10 million residents are included, only about 51% of them have been fully vaccinated. (Health officials say herd immunity requires that 70-85% of a population be vaccinated.) Thus, as the unvaccinated in L.A. tend to be much younger, more young people are getting sick than before. “We’re seeing cases in children and younger adults rising,” Davis warned, before noting that adults getting vaccinated helps protect unvaccinated children who live with them. In fact, the 7-day case rate per 100,000 is rising most rapidly among L.A. residents between the ages of 18 and 29, which means they are likely driving the surge. See the green line on the graph below which charts those rates from June-July. The county recorded 1,537 new cases on Thursday. That’s the highest daily number since early March and up from 1,315 on Wednesday and 1,103 on Tuesday. Those rising numbers are being identified even as testing has dropped precipitously. Thursday was the seventh consecutive day cases topped 1,000. For perspective, one month ago the 5-day average of cases was 201. On Tuesday, the 5-day average was 1,095; this is an increase of more than 500% in just one month. A more reliable number, the 7-day average test positivity rate, had increased nearly 700% from the 0.5% seen a month ago to Tuesday’s 3.4%. On Sunday it was 2.4%, so it rose over 40% in 48 hours alone. On Thursday, test positivity reached 3.75%. The number of people hospitalized in the county due to Covid topped 400 for the first time since early May on Thursday. That number has been climbing steadily for the past three weeks, and is now double the count reported when Covid health restrictions were lifted statewide on June 15. Asked how long the order might stay in place, Davis emphasized that the spread of infections has the county nowhere near a return to normal. “This is not the same situation as June 15,” he said. “We were at a low level when we reopened. This is a very different situation from where we were when restrictions were lifted.”"
"Biden Regime’s Door-To-Door Vax “Injection Program” Tells Officials To Ignore Law, Hide Side Effects",14 JUL 2021,5337,"Vaccine officials going door-to-door to inject Americans have been told to break laws and hide the deadly side effects of the experimental vaccine. It’s already begun in North Carolina. WBTV reported: The Mecklenburg County Health Department is bringing the COVID-19 vaccine to your doorstep. On Monday, health staff launched the ‘Doses to Doors’ program. Volunteers with non-profits like Action NC have been knocking on doors and providing vaccine information to people since May, but now they also have county health department staff on standby nearby so that if someone wants a shot, they can get it from the comfort of their home. The program is focused on priority zip codes with low vaccine uptake. On Monday, they started their efforts at the South Side Homes apartment complex in Charlotte. Many of the people who answered their doors said they either were already vaccinated or were not interested. Action NC volunteers are handing people pamphlets with information. Four people decided on the spot that they would get their shot. “We’re not confrontational, it’s not like you have to get the shot,” Robert Dawkins with Action NC told WBTV. “But our job is to dispel rumors and things.” Dawkins hopes this new program will be a game-changer. “We get people that will say ‘yes I will get the shot’, but the follow-up has always been the issue,” Dawkins said. “Will they go? How can we get people to go out and go? So, now that the health department is out with us, we miss that middle step now.” One man, who did not want to be identified, jumped at the chance to get the shot on his front porch. Mecklenburg County medical director Dr. Meg Sullivan administered the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot. “The reason I haven’t been vaccinated yet because I didn’t have the convenience of getting around to get there,” the man said. “I have grandkids in here I watch every day.” Health leaders hope to reach more people like this man who says he probably would not have gotten around to it. He said he’s glad the opportunity came knocking literally at his door. “Hey I’m glad I took the shot!” he said. “Now I can join the band again and walk around and be safe.” He also said he was going to tell his family members he got vaccinated in hopes that it encourages them to do it too. Mecklenburg County Public Health is also taking requests for at-home vaccinations. Click here for more information. There have been some critics of these door-to-door programs. Governor Henry McMaster is calling on the South Carolina health department to ban these kinds of efforts. In a statement McMaster said: “Enticing, coercing, intimidating, mandating, or pressuring anyone to take the vaccine is a bad policy which will deteriorate the public’s trust and confidence in the State’s vaccination efforts.” Dawkins told WBTV he and the other volunteers are providing an opportunity rather than pressuring anyone. The Gateway Pundit reported: After failing to hit their goal of vaccinating 70% of Americans by July 4th, the Biden regime is recruiting left-wing activists to go door-to-door to gather information on who has not been vaccinated and to encourage them to get the jab. This is despite the growing body of evidence that shows the vaccine is less than perfect, dangerous and even deadly. Newly released training documents detail how they are recruiting and training these goons to pester senior citizens who should have the freedom to make their own choices. Lake County, Illinois released documents relating to their “Community Health Ambassador Outreach Door Knocking Project” that is designed to increase “COVID Vaccine Acceptance.” The documents reveal this administration’s questionable tactics in their slimy sales pitch for door knockers to ‘educate’ people on the experimental jab while invading their privacy and withholding vaccine side effects. “Senior Citizen: I’ve had allergic reactions to medications and foods years ago, is this vaccine safe for me? Community Health Associate: The only true contraindication to this vaccine is a severe (anaphylactic) reaction to an injectable/vaccine in your past.” Photos of the script uncover their campaign to lie to, harass, and intimidate those who have not received a vaccine. Volunteers are instructed to coerce property managers into letting them on the property to collect data on residents. Volunteers are coached on how to let the property manager know that no personal info will be collected on residents, however the workers are also given a separate sheet to gather information such as: contact info, addresses, vaccination status, and vaccine interest. In other words, they are lying about information being collected in order to get to your door to use intimidation tactics. The script instructs vaccine goons to lie about side effects and explains they should end their conversations by telling the harassed senior citizen to “be a part of the COVID solution” so they can take the first step to “get their lives back.” They are also directed to violate people’s privacy by ignoring  “no solicitation” restrictions and adding residents’ personal information to a government database. “Community Health Associate: I want to thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Getting the vaccine is the first step in getting our lives back. You can be part of the COVID solution.“"
Massive Global Study Finds COVID Cure! Existing Drug Can “End This Pandemic”,13 JUL 2021,3339,"Not only does a recent study prove that there is a cure for COVID, but the same drug also prevents infection better than the experimental and deadly vaccine. In a newly released medical review, the American Journal of Therapeutics reported.  WASHINGTON — A COVID-19 treatment capable of ending the pandemic once and for all may already be available for use. A team of researchers, including three U.S. government senior scientists, are calling for governments around the world to start treating coronavirus patients with ivermectin. Their findings reveal the drug not only prevents people from contracting COVID, but also defeats the virus and saves lives. “We did the work that the medical authorities failed to do, we conducted the most comprehensive review of the available data on ivermectin,” says Dr. Pierre Kory, president and chief medical officer of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), in a media release. “We applied the gold standard to qualify the data reviewed before concluding that ivermectin can end this pandemic.” Researchers conducted a comprehensive review of 27 reports from clinical, in vitro, animal, and real-world studies. These include 15 randomized controlled trials, which are the preferred scientific method of the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the European Medicines Agency. Those findings reveal treating COVID-19 patients with ivermectin resulted in large drops in coronavirus deaths. The recovery time from an infection and the time it takes to clear COVID from someone’s system also saw significant reductions among patients on ivermectin. Additionally, three randomized controlled trials and five observational controlled trials which included nearly 2,500 healthy participants discovered using ivermectin noticeably reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19. Study authors note that several regions globally now recognize this drug as both a powerful vaccine and treatment for COVID-19. The countries of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Mexico, and India have all approved ivermectin’s use during the pandemic, according to the team. Researchers add their findings show that immediate global distribution of ivermectin will likely lead to “rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality.” So the question is, why aren’t doctors in the United States and elsewhere using ivermectin to treat COVID patients in 2021? Study authors don’t have an answer for that, but are urging doctors everywhere to demand that local and national health officials add ivermectin to the list of approved coronavirus treatments right away. “Our latest research shows, once again, that when the totality of the evidence is examined, there is no doubt that ivermectin is highly effective as a safe prophylaxis and treatment for COVID-19,” adds Dr. Paul E. Marik, founding member of the FLCCC and chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School. “We can no longer rely on many of the larger health authorities to make an honest examination of the medical and scientific evidence. So, we are calling on regional public health authorities and medical professionals around the world to demand that ivermectin be included in their standard of care right away so we can end this pandemic once and for all.”  "
"Biden Regime Demands Carriers Fact-Check Your Private, Personal Text Messages",13 JUL 2021,5083,"The Biden Regime just went full fascist. They are demanding control and ‘fact checking’ for the words you write in personal, private text communications. Conservative Treehouse explained: Buried in a Politico article about the White House and Biden Regime planning to aggressively confront anyone who attempts to counter their demands of vaccination, including direct confrontation toward any media outlet that would distribute any counter message conflicting the regime narrative, there is this little alarming notation (emphasis mine): Politico […] …”Biden allied groups, including the Democratic National Committee, are also planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages. The goal is to ensure that people who may have difficulty getting a vaccination because of issues like transportation see those barriers lessened or removed entirely.”.. (link)
 Yes, you read that correctly.  Fact-checking your SMS text messages through your carrier, your cell phone or internet provider. This is a rather remarkable escalation in totalitarian censorship instruction.  Not only will Big Tech social media networks (Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) censor, delete, and look into any content placed in their “private sector” domain, but the implication is now that AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, T-Mobile, etc., etc. will deploy monitors and fact-checkers to control what you are allowed to say in text messages to your friends and family. We have noted in past discussion that ISP providers have been enlisted to use their control nodules to steer and restrict internet travel; even placing landing warnings on websites that are arbitrarily deemed dangerous to approved government messaging.  However, taking the leap to control the content of all communication platforms is another level entirely. Another aspect to this is how the Intelligence Branch is closely connected to the private-public partnership.  None of these control mechanisms would work if the corporate private sector was not willingly going along with the demands of intrusive government. The Gateway Pundit added: The Biden regime is now calling on SMS carriers to “fact-check” text messages in an effort to stop ‘misinformation’ about the Covid-19 vaccine. Last Tuesday White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden Administration will be sending goons door-to-door to harass unvaccinated Americans. Biden confirmed that during his remarks last week and said his admin will focus on communities where vaccination rates are low. “We need to go community-by-community, neighborhood-by-neighborhood, and oft times door-to-door, literally knocking on doors,” Biden said. Now the Biden regime and its Democrat allies are going to monitor private communications to “dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages.” Democrat goons are already attacking TPUSA’s Charlie Kirk for his messaging campaign around vaccine efforts. “Organizations that are feeding misinformation and trying to mischaracterize this type of trusted-messenger work, I believe you are doing a disservice to the country and to the doctors, the faith leaders, community leaders, and others who are working to get people vaccinated, save lives, and help end this pandemic,” WH Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients said at a news conference last week. Politico reported: Biden allied groups, including the Democratic National Committee, are also planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages. The goal is to ensure that people who may have difficulty getting a vaccination because of issues like transportation see those barriers lessened or removed entirely. “We are steadfastly committed to keeping politics out of the effort to get every American vaccinated so that we can save lives and help our economy further recover,” White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz said. “When we see deliberate efforts to spread misinformation, we view that as an impediment to the country’s public health and will not shy away from calling that out.” Charlie Kirk, the pro-Trump co-founder of the conservative student organization Turning Point USA, said on Fox last week that he was embarking on a “massive public relations campaign” around vaccination efforts, which he compared it to an “Apartheid-style open air hostage situation.” (Turning Point’s other founder, Bill Montgomery, died last year from coronavirus-related complications.) Turning Point USA has also sent out SMS messages urging people to sign petitions on the topic. In one message, viewed by POLITICO, Kirk contends, “Biden is sending goons DOOR-TO-DOOR to make you take a Covid-19 vaccine. Sign the petition to: No medical raids in America.” The rabid left already has complete control over the internet and censors social media posts and blog posts so it was a matter of time until they started censoring text messages."
"Fauci ‘Horrified’ CPAC Audience Doesn’t Believe His Lies, Doesn’t Want To Be Guinea Pigs For Evil Madman",12 JUL 2021,1801,"Fatal Dr. Anthony Fauci is ‘horrified’ that he can’t increase his personal death counts…. Like a true psychopath. He’s the one who has lied repeatedly about COVID, costing who knows how many lives. The Gateway Pundit reported: Dr. Fauci on Sunday appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and told host Jake Tapper he just doesn’t get why conservatives at CPAC cheered Americans who don’t want the Covid vaccine. CPAC attendees on Saturday applauded and cheered a comment on low vaccination rates. Fauci thinks it’s horrifying that Americans are capable of critical thinking and doing research. There are now 6,985 reported deaths from the COVID-19 vaccinations across the United States this year. There have been 411,931 adverse reactions reported to the vaccine. “It’s horrifying…I just don’t get that. I mean, and I don’t think that anybody who is thinking clearly can get that,” Fauci told Tapper. “We’ve got to put aside this ideological difference or differences thinking that somebody is forcing you to do something. The public health officials, like myself and my colleagues, are asking you to do something that will ultimately save your life and that of your family, and that of the community,” Fauci whined. “I don’t know. I really don’t have a good explanation, Jake, about why this is happening. I mean, it’s ideological rigidity, I think. There’s no reason not to get vaccinated.” Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Jake Tapper asks Dr. Anthony Fauci to react to the CPAC Texas crowd cheering that the government has been unable to reach its vaccine goals so far.

"CNN CCP ‘Dr.’: It Needs To Be Hard For People To Remain Unvaccinated, Mandatory Testing Twice A Week",12 JUL 2021,874,"Apparently, CNN has stopped all pretenses and is pure communist propaganda now. Conservative Treehouse explained: CNN Medical Analyst Leanna Wen was born in Shanghai, China. She is a fellow at the CCP propaganda outlet The Brookings Institute where many of the U.S-Chinese propagandists are spawned. During a recent CNN segment, Ms. Wen says life ‘Needs to Be Hard‘ for unvaccinated Americans. Keep in mind this a point of advocacy from CNN the corporate media outlet. Ms. Wen does not hold any position in the U.S. government; her opinions and demands are specifically those positions of the media outlet that pays her to promote them. This is CNN, and this is also why most Americans despise CNN. From her pro-communist perspective, Ms. Leanna Wen just wants more Americans to get used to the totalitarian lifestyle.  All your freedoms belong to us… smile everyone, smile."
"Biden Regime Dictates: Government Has A Right To Know Vax Status, HIPPA Ignored",9 JUL 2021,3179,"The Health Secretary for the Biden Regime just violated HIPPA law during a live interview, but the media is silent. His outrageous and illegal claim is that the government has a right to know the vaccination status of its slaves (aka citizens). Conservative Treehouse wrote: The same political voices who said the Census Bureau was not allowed to ask about the citizenship status of U.S. residents are now saying HHS has the right to know if you have been vaccinated or not.   This is not hypocrisy, this is the ideological mindset of totalitarian elites who will tell you what is, and is not, permitted behavior. We The People are insignificant gnats; the power elites will tell us what we are allowed to do, even what they will teach our children in schools.  Hopefully people wake up soon and realize this will not end well. Having previously announced the government will go door-to-door asking about vaccination compliance, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra declared Thursday that “it is absolutely the government’s business” to know people’s vaccination status, arguing the federal government has a vested interest in keeping Americans safe. “The federal government has spent trillions of dollars to try and keep Americans alive during this pandemic,” Becerra said on CNN’s “New Day.” “So it is absolutely the government’s business, it is taxpayers’ business, if we have to continue to spend money to try and keep people from contracting COVID.” The Gateway Pundit added: Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Xavier Becerra on Thursday said it’s “absolutely the government’s business” to know which Americans are not vaccinated. The Biden Administration is using the “Delta” variant to scare Americans into getting vaccinated. Biden on Tuesday said he will send goons “door-to-door” to harass unvaccinated Americans. CNN host Brianna Keilar asked Becerra about the “door-to-door” effort to bully and harass Americans into taking an experimental vaccine. “I wonder if you can answer that criticism: ‘It’s none of the government’s business knowing who has or hasn’t been vaccinated.’ What do you say?” CNN host Brianna Keilar asked. Becerra said the quiet part out loud: The government owns the American people now after handing out stimulus checks and loans during the forced shutdown. “The federal government has had to spend trillions of dollars to try to keep Americans alive during this pandemic, so it is absolutely the government’s business,” Becerra said. “It is the taxpayer’s business if we have to continue to spend money to try to keep people from contracting COVID and helping reopen the economy. And so, it is our business to try to make sure Americans can prosper, Americans can freely associate, and knocking on a door has never been against the law.” “You don’t have to answer, but we hope you do,” Becerra added. If that doesn’t send chills up your spine… “It’s absolutely the government’s right to know if you have been vaccinated. We spent trillions trying to keep you healthy of COVID.

"Vaccine Gains Spot In Top 50 Causes of Death In America: Toll Nearly 7,000 Dead From Jab",9 JUL 2021,1069,"The number of deaths caused by vaccines is climbing fast, even at the CDC website, which has deliberately slanted numbers in the past. The Gateway Pundit reported: There are now 6,985 reported deaths from the COVID-19 vaccinations across the United States this year. That number is now at 6,985. “The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database contains information on unverified reports of adverse events (illnesses, health problems and/or symptoms) following immunization with US-licensed vaccines. Reports are accepted from anyone and can be submitted electronically at www.vaers.hhs.gov.” There have been 411,931 adverse reactions reported to the vaccine. In a recent study of 2017 numbers there were:
** 2,812 accidental fire deaths
** 3,709 accidantal(?) drownings
** 4,968 homicides other than firearms
** 5,611 deaths from Hepatitis
** 5,698 deaths from AIDS
** 6,554 deaths from deliberate poisonings
** 6,946 deaths from accidental suffocations That would put deaths from the COVID-19 Vaccine higher on the list than AIDS, drownings and Hepatitis."
Senator Explains How To Stop Feds From Harassing You About Vaccine,8 JUL 2021,1406,"After the Biden regime announced that government goons would be ‘visiting’ American citizens in their homes to force an experimental and ineffective COVID ‘vaccine,’ one Arizona Senator has advice for any free people who don’t want such trespassers harassing them. The Gateway Pundit explained: This morning, Arizona State Senator Kelly Townsend informed us on how to protect ourselves against Vaccine Nazis. She shared this tweet telling us what we can do before the feds come asking for our papers. I have spoken to local law enforcement and if you don’t want the Federal government on your property asking about vaccines, they advise you to post a no trespassing sign in a visible location. This is a prerequisite to be able to charge someone for being there against your will. These people will need to enter at their own risk if you take this step. Arizona GOP Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward then suggested personalizing your sign to specifically prohibit vaccine harassment and trespassing. Who thinks we will see a surge in “No Trespassing” signs? And could/should they be individualized to specifically prohibit people from harassing you about vaccinations? And why doesn’t #HIPAA &/or the #4A already prevent this govt harassment? Isn’t our health info private? What happened to our right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures? What happened to our rights over our health information?"
"Vaccinated Student Catches COVID from Vaccinated Relative, Infects 83 High School Students",7 JUL 2021,1149,"The vaccine that the Biden administration (aka communist China) is bent on making the world accept is ineffective and deadly. The Gateway Pundit explained: A vaccinated Israeli student infected 83 classmates after catching COVID-19 from a vaccinated relative. Israel is seeing another wave of COVID infections despite its high number of vaccinations. Oops! German Morgen Post reported: (translated) A corona outbreak among schoolchildren after a party in Tel Aviv worries the health authorities in Israel . As the TV broadcaster Channel 12 reports, at least 83 young people caught the virus at the celebration – all of them with the same classmate. The main worrying thing about the case is the chain of infection that led to the outbreak. According to the Times of Israel, the young man who distributed the virus at the party was vaccinated. He, in turn, had become infected from a relative who had also been vaccinated, and that relative had become infected from a person who was also vaccinated and who was recently in London. It is unclear which variant of the coronavirus it is. https://t.co/f7D554Oywp — Disclose.tv  (@disclosetv) July 5, 2021"
Not A Single Case: Now Scientists Claim ‘Lambda’ Variant ‘Resists’ Vaccine,7 JUL 2021,1941,"In what was a foregone conclusion, given their success at exploiting and stealing the 2020 election, liberal ‘scientists’ now claim a new variant of COVID is resistant to the experimental and deadly vaccine. The Gateway Pundit explained: Scientists are now claiming the “Lambda” variant may be resistant to Covid-19 vaccines. The Lambda variant, which reportedly originated in Peru last summer, is all of a sudden a concern to scientists who say mutations could be ‘resistant to Covid vaccines.’ Fox News reported: The World Health Organization said the variant’s mutations could increase its transmissibility or possibly increase its resistance to “neutralizing antibodies.” The health body called Lambda, or C.37, a “variant of interest.” “So far we have seen no indication that the lambda variant is more aggressive,” Jairo Mendez-Rico, a WHO virologist, told the Deutsche Welle. “It is possible that it may exhibit higher infection rates, but we don’t yet have enough reliable data to compare it to gamma or delta.” He told the German outlet that as SARS-CoV-2 evolves, it may start to become more transmissible, but not as deadly. Jeff Barrett, director of the COVID-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK, told the Financial Times that a reason it is challenging to “make sense of the threat from lambda, using computational and lab data, is that it has rather an unusual set of mutations, compared with other variants.” Meanwhile, the Biden Administration is using the “Delta” variant to scare Americans into getting vaccinated. Biden on Tuesday said he will send goons door-to-door to harass unvaccinated Americans. These tyrants are never going to let go of their newfound power. While busy beaches and packed parks might seem like a risk, there hasn't been a single case of outdoor transmission since the pandemic began. @cokeefe9 #9News pic.twitter.com/5cakA7Nmnq — 9News Sydney (@9NewsSyd) July 6, 2021"
Fireworks Are Racist? National Geographic Says Smoke ‘Disproportionately’ Impacts Blacks,6 JUL 2021,2184,"Apparently, the National Geographic couldn’t resist claiming that fireworks are racist. The Gateway Pundit explained: National Geographic posted an unhinged and unscientific tweet on Independence Day saying fireworks are racist because they affect communities of color. What complete BS. This is what can be described as “scientism” and NOT “science.”
There is absolutely no proof to support this theory. In fact, in cities like St. Louis and New York City, minorities shoot off guns on New Year’s Eve and the 4th of July. This is much more dangerous than sniffing fireworks smoke for a night. The junk scientists behind this nonsense also did not take into consideration the thousands of communities, including rural towns, where fireworks are a 4th of July tradition. The people there are not affected by the smoke for some reason. This appears to be the latest example where the modern-day left ruins everything that is fun and exciting in order to reshape society into something dreadful and sad. The netizens reacted immediately. The Daily Mail reported: The study published in May by researchers at the University of California’s Irvine campus suggests that law enforcement should crack down on illegal displays and that municipal and corporate displays should be replaced by drone light shows. National Geographic’s tweet was met with swift criticism from Twitter users who branded it unnecessarily divisive and decried the outlet for putting a damper on the holiday. ‘It never ends with the ridiculous headlines about race. Give it a rest,’ one critic replied to National Geographic. ‘What happened to the old Nat Geo, where we talked about animals and how amazing they are?’ another added. A third critic wrote: ‘Honestly, I am a scientist and this is beyond ridiculous.’ LET US ENJOY THE DAMN FIREWORKS,’ a fourth tweeted. In the 18-page study, published on May 27 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, researchers from UC Irvine used crowdsourced data to assess how air pollution affects communities across California, which is already known to have some of the highest levels of air pollution across the country. Give it a rest, NatGeo."
FB Goes Full Orwellian: Pop Ups Encourage Users To Help Control ‘Dissidents’ By Ratting Them Out,2 JUL 2021,5015,"Facebook isn’t even trying to pretend like they aren’t a strong arm of the communist party anymore. Conservative Treehouse explained: Jumpin’ ju-ju bones, George Orwell was either a time-traveler or he just had incredible prescience. We are all subversives and counter-revolutionaries now! Facebook users are reporting today that warnings and alerts are showing up on their feeds notifying them they may have been “exposed to extremist content.”  The alerts provide users the option to “Get Support” from some entity that will assist them in deprogramming the unauthorized thoughts that may have followed exposure. It is easy to see where this ideological control mechanism is going.  Big Tech doesn’t want comrade citizens exposed to thoughts and opinions that might run counter to the approved worldview of the totalitarian state.   It’s actually quite remarkable to see this so publicly pushed, and see them so open about it. Obviously a visit to the wrong website (your internet travel obviously being tracked by the command and control authorities) will likely trigger the warning.  Visit The Conservative Tree House and receive a warning upon exit “you have been exposed to harmful extremist content”. I think back to that scene in 2001 A Space Odyssey when Dave Bowman is trying to stop the computer system HAL-9000 (artificial intelligence) from controlling his behavior, control his spacecraft, and ultimately killing him: “Dave, I’m afraid I can’t let you do that”… Yikes, this approach from Big Tech is creepy as hell. On the positive side of this, the effort is resoundingly going to backfire amid a larger segment of the younger population, they are already using subversive accounts like Fleebook, Flinsta and Fleet to avoid detection amid their online activity.   The rebel alliance will only become more slippery and more focused on the need to approach everything with the insurgency mindset. Regardless of how much Big Tech, Big Intel and Big Government synergize in their efforts to control human behavior, the Rebel Alliance ultimately wins every long-term contest.   History proves this to be true.  The need for freedom is still an inherent and underlying human condition amid the majority. As Mike Vanderboegh said so eloquently: “We will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.  And when we are gone, the scattered, free survivors hiding in the ruins of our once-great republic will sing of our deeds in forbidden songs, tending the flickering flame of individual liberty until it bursts forth again, as it must, generations later.” National File reported: Facebook has recently included a deradicalization program into their latest update, reaching out to its members so they can “get advice from people who escaped violent extremist groups.” This pop-up will appear when you first log in to Facebook, letting members know that Facebook cares about “preventing extremism” on their platform. It lures members in with letting them know that “others in your situation have received confidential support.” Facebook has provided its users with directions on how to indicate that someone close to them may be involved in “hate groups” and how to help in their deradicalization. The tech giant added signs that someone may be at risk to be an extremist, including “unusual amounts of anger or aggression” and “spending unhealthy amounts of time online.” There was a small disclaimer at the bottom that these behaviors may be indicative of someone struggling with depression, suicidal thoughts, or stress. Facebook linked a former extremist group, Life After Hate, who say they engage in the deradicalization of far-right extremists. The tech giant claimed that “group leaders may lie or brainwash their followers with false information” and take advantage of group members to do violent or illegal activities. Facebook has also linked the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right (CARR), a U.K. research center that focuses on far-right activities. CARR has listed a number of far-right symbols, including ancient Germanic runes to cartoon Pepe the Frog. While Facebook has come out and explicitly stated that they not accept serious threats of violence, hate groups, or terrorist groups, they did not explicitly state that standard. Facebook stated that they “work with law enforcement if we think there might be real risk of harm” but did not state the standard where they involved law enforcement. Facebook deradicalization program is flagging “extremists” across their platform if they suspect them of far-right behavior. They have tried make an argument that minorities are not destroying the country, stating that the founding fathers welcomed immigration and that hate groups oversimplify problems in the country.

"Rabbi Stabbed In Boston Street Outside Synagogue, Khaled Awad In Custody",2 JUL 2021,2825,"A father and Rabbi was stabbed in a Boston street. Local CBS affiliate ‘reported’: A rabbi is recovering after he was stabbed eight times outside a Jewish school in Brighton Thursday afternoon. Boston Police were called to Shaloh House on Chestnut Hill Avenue around 1 p.m. after Rabbi Shlomo Noginski was attacked by a man outside. Noginski was rushed to Boston Medical Center with what police described as non-life threatening injuries. He was released overnight. The rabbi, who is Russian-born and in his 50’s, is a father of 12 children. “I am grateful to the Boston Police Department for their rapid response, and relieved that the perpetrator is in custody. I am looking forward to returning to my work as soon as possible,” said Rabbi Noginski from his hospital bed. Police arrested 24-year-old Khaled Awad in connection to the stabbing. WBZ-TV I-Team sources said he was armed with a gun and a knife. “The attacker came to him and pointed a gun at him, and said, ‘Open your car.’ [Rabbi Noginski] gave him the key and said, ‘Here’s the key’. And he said ‘No, you open the car.’” said Dan Rodkin, Executive Director of the Shaloh House. The crime scene extended across Chestnut Hill Avenue, from where the two struggled by the van to the park where the rabbi ran to get away. Awad was quickly arrested by police. He is expected to be arraigned in Brighton District Court on assault and battery charges Friday. Police are still investigating the motive behind the attack. The Shaloh House was put in lockdown after the stabbing. Staff and children were there for a summer camp program, but Rodkin said none were in danger. Security will be increased at Shaloh House throughout the remainder of the summer, Rodkin added. “A Jewish saying says, ‘A little bit of light pushes away a lot of darkness. Good has much more power than evil,’“ said Rodkin about the incident. One woman who was walking in the area said her “heart sank” when she heard what had happened. “Jewish education is important to us, but I also don’t want to have a target on our backs. And I’m scared. As a mom, I’m very scared,” she said. Anti-Defamation League responds to Brighton stabbing Robert Trestan of the Anti-Defamation League said that while the motive for the attack is not yet known, it still sends fear through the Jewish community. “It sends a bit of a shockwave through the Jewish community,” Trestan said. “This occurred in a community where many Orthodox Jews live, worship and study. At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise across the country, and we learn and hear about other people who are Jewish who are attacked in new York and Los Angeles in the last 4-6 weeks, this sends a message of fear through the community.” The Jewish community will gather for a vigil on Friday at 10 a.m. at the park where the stabbing took place."
Biden Regime Deploying “Teams” Across US To ‘Encourage’ Vaccine For Delta: Symptoms Identical To Hay Fever,2 JUL 2021,4886,"The Biden regime is determined to make all Americans accept the experimental vaccine, which of course, is very ineffective and actually does considerable harm, in light of the so-called ‘delta’ variant globalists are now pushing. But what they are NOT telling you is that the symptoms of the variant are identical to hay fever, something that millions of Americans deal with every season anyway. The Gateway Pundit explained: The Biden Administration will be deploying “Delta variant” response teams across the country to communities with low vaccination rates. The teams will be made up of officials from the CDC, Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to CNN. The government officials will be focused on communities with low vaccination rates as Biden’s goal of 70% vaccination by 4th of July falls short. As of this week, only 47.2% of Americans are fully vaccinated. CNN reported: The White House has deployed similar response teams in the past, but this is the first time they are focused on the Delta variant, a White House official said. These response teams will conduct surge testing, provide therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies and deploy federal personnel to areas that need support staff for vaccinations. The White House coronavirus team is spearheading this effort and officials expect the teams will help with everything from boosting testing, providing supplies and potentially increasing paid media efforts targeting regions where vaccinations are low. While these response teams are being sent to prop up communities, officials believe vaccinations are the number one way to stop the spread and recognize there could be a limit to their efforts. Most US adults who plan to get vaccinated against Covid-19 have already done so, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report released this week. Republican Senator Rand Paul (KY) pushed back on fearmongers using the “Delta” variant as a pretext to reimpose mask mandates and lockdowns. Don’t let the fearmongers win. New public England study of delta variant shows 44 deaths out of 53,822 (.08%) in unvaccinated group. Hmmm. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 29, 2021 The National File reported: Top experts have likened the COVID-19 “Delta Variant” to the common cold and hay fever. This comes as people like Anthony Fauci, Boris Johnson, and the WHO are pushing for more social distancing, lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccinations. Experts in the United Kingdom have compared the symptoms of the COVID-19 “Delta Variant” to that of hay fever and the common cold, according to various reports. The new strain has reportedly been the cause of 99% of all new COVID-19 cases in the UK. “The main symptoms of COVID-19 appear to have changed — with headaches and sore throats now more common than fevers and coughs, according to a warning by UK experts,” noted the New York Post. “Allergy sufferers can experience some of the same symptoms as those with Covid, which can cause huge levels of anxiety,” said Dr. Connor Bryant, co-founder of clean air tech MedicAir, according to Mirror. “COVID is acting differently now, it’s more like a cold,” said Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology. “All those are not the old classic symptoms.” Dr. Fauci continues to assert that “the Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the US to our attempt to eliminate COVID-19,” which reportedly has accounted for 20% of all new COVID-19 cases in the United States. Fauci maintains that COVID-19 vaccines can protect people from the “Delta Variant,” adding that young, unvaccinated people are “more vulnerable than ever.” However, many Americans are skeptical about the COVID-19 vaccinations they’ve received amid reports of the “Delta Variant” infecting individuals after they’ve been fully vaccinated. As was reported by the Wall Street Journal, “About half of adults infected in an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Israel were fully inoculated with the Pfizer Inc. vaccine, prompting the government to reimpose an indoor mask requirement and other measures to contain the highly transmissible strain.” On May 13, Joe Biden told America to “get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do,” prompting hundreds of millions of Americans to eventually receive their COVID-19 vaccines. The World Health Organization is now urging fully vaccinated individuals to continue wearing masks, socially distance, and practice COVID-19 safety measures. “Vaccine alone won’t stop community transmission,” said Dr. Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products. “People need to continue to use masks consistently, be in ventilated spaces, hand hygiene … the physical distance, avoid crowding. This still continues to be extremely important, even if you’re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing.”"
Audio Proves Biden Campaign Oversaw Theft Of “Living and Dead” IDs For Absentee Ballots,1 JUL 2021,25113,"In Texas, audio recordings are showing that the Biden campaign oversaw the illegal theft of both living and dead voter ID’s for absentee ballots. The National file reported: Identities of living and dead people were stolen in Harris County, Texas to fraudulently vote in the 2020 election, according to bombshell audio obtained by NATIONAL FILE. A convicted forger who mailed the fraudulent ballot applications in Democrat Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee’s district worked as a campaign assistant for Sheila Jackson Lee’s 2020 campaign, and has gotten paid by Jackson Lee’s campaign efforts in the past. The Joe Biden campaign’s 2020 Texas political director Dallas Jones oversaw this alleged voter fraud operation and he was interrogated by the FBI in the last weeks of the 2020 election according to insiders. The audio below includes phone calls in which people confirm that their identities or the identities of their dead relatives were stolen in Harris County. This information has been provided to the Texas Secretary of State for the purpose of aiding Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office in formal investigations. AUDIO CLIP 1: WOMAN SURPRISED TO FIND OUT SHE HAS BEEN VOTING: “They’ve got a Sylvia Thomas…voting in Harris County,” said private investigator and former FBI Special Surveillance Group member Charles Marler, who called Sylvia Thomas and correctly cited her February 19, 1940 birth date. Sylvia Thomas says “I’ve been away from Harris County” and confirmed that she has not voted in Harris County in recent years even though someone has been obtaining absentee ballots on her behalf. The woman does not recognize the name of Tomar Bishop, who obtained the absentee ballots associated with Thomas’ identity, or Gloria Palmer, the recent Sheila Jackson-Lee campaign PAC vendor who oversaw Tomar Bishop. Sylvia Thomas wonders “What else are they doing?” in addition to fraudulently voting on her behalf. Here is Sylvia Thomas’ absentee ballot application in the 2020 election (with her address obscured), which is just one of the fraudulent absentee ballot applications in the possession of NATIONAL FILE. AUDIO TWO: A DEAD MAN APPLIES TO VOTE: In this call, private investigator Charles Marler confirms with a woman in Harris County that a man who applied to “vote” in the election named Jesse Burks passed away on November 4, 2015. The woman confirms this death. The dead Burks’ address matches the address of the “voter.” The woman does not recognize Tomar Bishop, who obtained the absentee ballot, or Gloria Palmer, who mailed the dead man’s ballot application in. AUDIO THREE: A DEAD MOTHER APPLIES TO VOTE: Private investigator Charles Marler confirms with a woman in Harris County that her mother Gloria Chambers, born in 1946, voted in the election despite dying in 2010. The daughter of the deceased voter does not know Tomar Bishop, who obtained the absentee ballot, or Gloria Palmer, who mailed the dead woman’s vote in. “That’s fine, because we don’t know either one of those people,” said the daughter of the dead voter, consenting to cooperate with Marler’s investigation. Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign paid convicted forger Gloria Palmer as a “campaign assistant” multiple times in 2020, according to Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign financial disclosures. Investigator Charles Marler confirms that the Gloria Palmer, who was paid by Jackson Lee’s campaign, is the same Gloria Palmer who mailed in the absentee ballot applications in 2020. A record shows Sheila Jackson Lee For Congress PAC paying Gloria Palmer for canvassing and campaign work in 2018. Here is a record of Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign paying Gloria Palmer to be a “campaign assistant” in 2020. Investigator, Charles Marler, tells NATIONAL FILE that “The vast majority of victims are people who are not aware their vote was stolen. In Harris County the first ballot in from ballot harvesters is counted, all second votes are discarded for that individual.” This is YUGE.  @TrumpWarRoom @HowleyReporter Massive Voter Fraud Ring Linked To Biden Campaign Scandal Accelerates https://t.co/riuXQyBz6N — 𝐃𝐨𝐧𝐢 ""𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐨𝐧""™ (@DoniTheDon_) October 26, 2020 Democrat political strategist Damien Thaddeus Jones, who served as regional political director for Beto O’Rourke’s U.S. Senate campaign, has come forward to blow the whistle on a massive voter fraud ring in Harris County, Texas. The voter fraud ring is overseen by Dallas Jones, who served as Texas Political Director for the Joe Biden presidential campaign. In this stunning audio obtained exclusively by NATIONAL FILE, Damien goes into detail about Dallas Jones’ fraudulent activity and work for Biden. On the tape, “Sheila” refers to Sheila Jackson-Lee. This article below delves into the massive evidence of voter fraud — including photographic evidence and sworn affidavits — that emerged in Harris County in 2020, and how its direct link to the Biden campaign provides even more justification for President Donald Trump’s ability to claim victory in the presidential election. LET’S BREAK DOWN THE FACTS ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FRENZIED FINAL WEEKS OF THE 2020 ELECTION: Harris County, Texas conducted 24-hour voting in the 2020 election, even as the county became engulfed in a voter fraud scandal that ensnared the Joe Biden campaign’s recent Texas political director Dallas Jones. A well-placed insider named Constance Stanton tells NATIONAL FILE that Dallas Jones was interrogated by the FBI and fired by the Biden campaign after he was implicated in an illegal Ballot Harvesting operation in sworn affidavits first reported by NATIONAL FILE. This scandal has since been picked up by various news outlets across the nation, including by Fox News. Vote count discrepancies are reported in Harris County. Sources within the FBI told NATIONAL FILE that Dallas Jones was interrogated but was not necessarily “picked up,” implying that Jones voluntarily submitted to FBI interrogation. Multiple sources tell NATIONAL file that Jones was fired by the Biden campaign. Here is what Constance Stanton told NATIONAL FILE in October: “Harris County Clerk’s Office in Harris County, Texas is intending to conduct an illegal polling operation on Thursday, October 29th, 2020. Harris County, home to Houston Texas, is the third largest voting county in the country with approximately 2.5 million voters. As Harris County goes, so goes Texas. As Texas goes, so goes the nation.  Harris County did not allow the GOP State Conversation to take place this past summer and it seems the socialist Democrats took complete control of Harris county when they won offices in 2018, by a 200,000 vote margin. 20 private investigators have uncovered a great deal. What has been uncovered is a group of masterminds wanting to destroy the Texas voting voice. Some of the masterminds include Democrat County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and Democrat State Senator Boris Miles. They have two captains, Gerald Womack and Dallas Jones. Jones was hired by the Biden campaign to run the Biden Texas operation. These captains have scores of paid vote harvesters working for them. Vote harvesting is a second-degree felony under the Texas Election Code. This is a criminal operation that these Democrat elected officials are running. Dallas Jones was picked up by the FBI, the weekend before last, for 2 days of interrogation. He was subsequently fired by the Biden campaign. They harvest ballots by mail from nursing homes, homeless centers, door to door in poor neighborhoods, often dressed as Census workers. They offer $50 gift cards in front of stores asking people to take ballots by mail, acquired from the above, to sign and mail at a local post office. They hold ballots by mail in several locations where people forge signatures on the collected ballots by mail. Evidence has been presented to the local DA, Kim Ogg, who received a substantial amount of political contributions from Soros funded organizations in her election in 2018. The evidence included an affidavit and other evidence, including photographs, from a 30 year black police officer who was serving as a poll watcher and saw the election judge use a table full of IDs to vote unregistered people that were voting by drive through. This is a criminal act according to the Texas Election Code. The district attorney’s office did not even want to entertain our criminal complaint. This information along with other affidavits of harassment of poll watchers and alternate election judges was sent to the office of Republican Atty. General Ken Paxton. The Democrat County clerk, Chris Hollins, instituted drive-through voting by anyone for any reason which is in violation of the Texas Election Code. A petition for writ of mandamus before the Texas Supreme Court last week to stop this illegal activity and they voted 7 to 1 to deny the petition. The County clerk has now opened up the early voting polling locations until 10 PM for the rest of the week until the last day of early voting, when eight polling places will be open 24 hours. Of the 120 early voting locations, the vast majority are in Democrat areas of the county. In violation of the Texas Election Code, Hollins independently mailed ballots by mail to all individuals 65 and older, in violation of Texas Election Code, which requires an individual to request a ballot by mail before it can be sent. Hollins planned on sending every registered voter a ballot by mail, but the Texas Supreme Court granted our petition and stopped this. The Harris County voter files have not been purged since 2016 when the Democrats took charge. We can document that dead people have voted in this election and people who have moved out of state. No arrest warrants have been issued and we do not expect them to issue any. In the meantime, the Democrats are implementing their massive election voter fraud scheme, mostly in open sight. One arrest would go miles in stopping this election fraud scheme. The drive through locations are located in primarily in Democrat areas. This also violates the 14th Amendment.” At Harrisvotes.com, clicking on “Polling Locations” and then the clock icon for “Hours of Operation” show that beginning on Thursday October 29 there were EIGHT polling locations that had 24-hour voting rolling into Friday morning. Texas poll watcher Raymond T. Stewart, a retired police officer, submitted a sworn affidavit Thursday that was provided to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office. That affidavit, first obtained by NATIONAL FILE, alleges that a Houston precinct judge and staff illegally used a stack of driver’s licenses in their possession to allow people to vote illegally in the 2020 election at a drive-through voting window created by the Coronavirus pandemic. Stewart’s affidavit and photos of the scheme are presented below. The acting precinct judge’s identity has been confirmed by the Harris County Clerk’s Office and insiders identify her as a Democrat. Harris County, where Houston is located, is also the site where the Joe Biden campaign’s Texas political director Dallas Jones is accused of running an illegal ballot harvesting operation, according to two separate affidavits submitted to the Texas Supreme Court by former law enforcement officials. Here is the GoFundMe page for private investigators who are busting what insiders say is one of the largest voter fraud rings in the United States. Here is a photo from the scene of the stack of driver’s licenses. Here Is The Sworn Affidavit, Under Oath, of Raymond T. Stewart: “My name is Raymond T. Stewart. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct. “I am a 30+ year veteran Texas Peace Officer. I am a volunteer poll watcher for Candidate Andre Hines. On 10/13/2020, at 8:40am, I arrived at polling location Northeast Multi-Services Center, PRCT ID SRD141C, 9720 Spaulding Street, Houston, Texas 77016.” “I informed the staff that I was a poll watcher for a candidate and had my paperwork. I asked for the precinct judge to sign my required paperwork so I could start work. The precinct judge is identified as April Elmore (Gibson) and she was there but refused to sign my paperwork and she instead directed me to someone inside named Madonna. Madonna signed the paperwork but not in the designated signature line. I then began my work as a poll watcher.” “I observed several oddities but the most concerning was a table in-between the sign-in tables One and Three. At that table was a large stack of Texas Driver’s Licenses. Staff would come inside from the drive-through voting booth and scan a driver’s license from someone outside and get a ticket and return outside. But sometimes a staff member would search through the stack of driver’s license on the table, then scan it, receive a ticket and also go outside to the drive-through booth. As a Police Officer, I quickly became suspicious that they were committing a crime by having the unattended D.L.’s just sitting on the table and that possible voting crimes were being committed using these forms of ID. Also during this time-frame an employee of the Harris County Attorney’s Office came by and he conversed with April but nothing changed and he departed. Since I was there as a poll watcher and not there as a Police Officer, I just continued to observe and considered how to deal with this situation. About that time a Precinct 1 Constable (Deputy W. Schultz) arrived at the polling location and he happened to be someone I knew professionally. I spoke with the Deputy outside and informed him of what I had observed. He was amazed and asked for evidence which I provided to him.” “Unfortunately our conversation was overheard by a staff member in the parking lot. The Deputy went inside the polling location but at this time the driver’s licenses were removed and hidden from the table. The Deputy departed the area apparently to consult with the election taskforce and supervisors. A spoke with him several times that day via phone and in person regarding my observations. At 1:00pm April commanded me to leave the polling location because I had observed and collected evidence and she informed me that ‘I couldn’t.’ I have not received any call from any Federal, County nor State official investigating these serious actions and crimes.” Raymond T. Stewart’s Affidavit Concludes Two private investigators, including a former FBI agent and former police officer, testify under oath that they have video evidence, documentation and witnesses to prove that Biden’s Texas Political Director Dallas Jones and his cohorts are currently hoarding mail-in and absentee ballots and ordering operatives to fill the ballots out for people illegally, including for dead people, homeless people, and nursing home residents, in the 2020 presidential election. The affidavits were filed as part of the class-action lawsuit against Harris County and the state of Texas, filed by citizens, called Steven Hotze, M.D. et al. Journalist Patrick Howley of NATIONAL FILE has exclusively obtained this testimony and much more evidence will be coming out in the case. Dallas Jones was named the Biden campaign’s Texas Political Director in early September. HERE IS THE AFFIDAVIT OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND RETIRED HOUSTON POLICE OFFICER MARK A. AGUIRRE, SUBMITTED UNDER OATH. READ IT HERE: AFFIDAVIT OF MARK A. AGUIRRE “My name is Mark A. Aguirre. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct. “I am a retired captain with the Houston Police Department I am now a private investigator. “I am currently involved in an investigation related to a wide-ranging and fraudulent ballot harvesting scheme in Harris County intended to rig the elections in the Houston/Harris County area. This scheme involves voter fraud on a massive scale. “Based on interviews, review of documents, and other information, I have identified the individuals in charge of the ballot harvesting scheme. These individuals includes political consultant Dallas Jones who was recently hired by the Joe Biden for President campaign to oversee their Harris County initiative. District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles, who is the handler of Mr. Jones, political consultant Gerald Womack, and Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis. One of the companies these individuals are using as a front for this operation is AB Canvassing, although there are others that have been identified that we are investigating.” “I have in my possession video-taped interviews of witnesses attesting to the aforementioned people having groups of people completing thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots, including completing ballots for deceased individuals; illegally going into nursing homes, with the complicity of the nursing home staff, and filling out and forging the signatures of nursing home residents; signing up homeless individuals to vote using the ballot harvester’s address then completing the ballot and forging the homeless individual’s signature. “This entire operation is being run by the elite politicians of the Democrat Party in Houston/Harris County. FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT. HERE IS THE AFFIDAVIT OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND FORMER FBI AGENT CHARLES MARLER, SUBMITTED UNDER OATH. READ IT HERE: 2020-09-27_Charles F. Marler Affidavit:  “My name is Charles F. Marler. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.” “I formerly worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigations where I was an Investigative Specialist conducting undercover operations on espionage and terrorist targets. I am now a private investigator.” “In December of 2019, I was approached by two individuals who witnessed activity from an illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County. Since that date, I have been investigating the illegal ballot harvesting operation.” “During my investigation, a core group of names continued to surface regarding the organization and operation of the voter fraud scheme. Witnesses have stated to me that Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles are leading the illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas. Their chief lieutenants are Houston businessman Gerald Womack and political consultant Dallas Jones who work directly under them in executing the ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas.” “Witnesses have shown me and described to me how the ballot harvesters take absentee ballots from the elderly in nursing homes, from the homeless, and from unsuspecting residences’ mailboxes. The ballot harvesters then complete the ballots for their preferred candidate and forge the signature of the “voter”. Two witnesses stated to me that there are two individuals employed at the Harris County Clerk’s Office who are aware of the illegal ballots and help facilitate and mask the processing of the ballots into the legal stream of ballots.” “I have been made aware of a law enforcement investigation in the Spring of 2020 regarding illegal ballot harvesting. Several interviews of individuals were conducted. After the interviews became public, former Harris County Clerk Diane Troutman, resigned alleging health concerns due to COVID-19. However, witnesses have told me that Ms. Troutman was arguing with Commission Rodney Ellis about the legality of the mass purchasing and mailing of mail-in ballots and that Troutman was concerned she would be included in the eventual arrest pertaining to illegal ballot harvesting. Instead of coming forward and exposing the scheme, Ms. Troutman abruptly resigned. Witnesses have stated that Commissioner Ellis was not deterred and continued to move forward with the plan to mass mail ballots and expand the illegal ballot harvesting scam. Another witness stated to me that an employee of Commission Ellis, Tyler James, has bragged that he could guarantee that the illegal ballot harvesting operation, with the help of mass mail-in ballots, could harvest 700,000 illegal ballots.” “It appears that law enforcement agencies are currently investigating these alleged crimes and I will provide them with the evidence that I have already collected and am continuing to collect. Sadly, these law enforcement agencies will be working to prosecute these crimes well after the November 3, 2020 election.” Here Is The GoFundMe Page for the ongoing private investigation which is working with law enforcement. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton recently announced 134 felony charges against four defendants stemming from an alleged 2018 Democrat primary scheme to use fake disabilities provide mail-in ballots to people who were not disabled. The Democrat claim that fear of Coronavirus constitutes a disability has been only partially successful in Texas. Harris County is sending mail-in ballot applications to county voters 65 and over, so nursing homes remain a hotspot for potential fraud. Texas began mailing absentee ballots to voters for the presidential election on September 19. NATIONAL FILE RECENTLY REPORTED Citizen journalist Colleen Vera has discovered evidence of what appears to be a massive voter fraud ring operating in the state of Texas involving mail-in voting and Democrat political campaigns. Evidence presented below includes a video of a Democrat campaign surrogate harvesting mail ballots from a nursing home, audio of a Democrat campaign worker admitting to harvesting ballots from a nursing home, and mail-in ballots from Harris County that all have the same handwriting and envelope process. Vera alleges that the campaign of Democrat Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee recently paid two convicted forgers, and that other Democrat campaigns have also paid convicted forgers for canvassing efforts. I spoke to Collen Vera regarding her findings as well as longtime Democrat Party operative Gerry Monroe, who knows full well what is happening in Harris County: Colleen Vera of Texas Trash Talk Reports… After the 2016 Democratic Primary, a candidate for Harris County Constable (Pct 3), Jasen Rabalais, filed a lawsuit claiming that a campaign worker for another candidate,Michel Pappillion, “deliberately falsified, illegally completed or unlawfully influenced the ballots and early voting applications of elderly residents in Harris County.” The lawsuit was dismissed. But the following audio tapes had been made by the  Rabalais campaign  after he found out that an “alleged harvester” was working for an opponent’s campaign. Link to Audio #1:  Gives name of “alleged harvester” Link to Audio #2:  “Alleged harvester” explains the services provided (phone # redacted) Then during the 2018 Primary, the following video was posted by Direct Action Texas. It appeared to show a campaign worker for Texas State Rep Harold Dutton Jr harvesting ballots of 400 elderly voters. After viewing the video, I decided to do some research. I figured, if there was any evidence of mailed ballot voter fraud to be found in Harris County, the more recent one – Dutton’s race – was the best place to start. I filed a request for public information covering the 1359 voters who voted by mail in Harold Dutton’s race. I requested electronic copies of the voters’: My first thought was to match each voter’s mailed ballot application with the voter’s ballot envelope and compare signatures to find those which may not match. But as I reviewed the documents, something else jumped off the page… 32 hand written applications for mailed ballots – all from different voters – but all written in the exact same handwriting. Looking closer, something else jumped off the page. All 32 returned their application for a ballot by mail in the same pre-printed envelope with the same style stamp. Out the envelopes which carried their returned ballots and the BIGGEST COINCIDENCE of ALL jumped off the page…ALL THESE VOTERS LIVED IN THE SAME PRECINCT!  Precinct #259…Additional research showed this same handwriting on multiple ballot by mail applications from precinct #259 every year going back to 2008…If that wasn’t enough to cause concern, I had to title this set of applications “Alleged Harvester A” because I found two more sets of multiple applications with similar handwriting, envelopes and stamps from varying precincts. I titled those “Alleged Harvester B” and “Alleged Harvester C.”… 30 ballots from Precinct #259 – in which the voters voted for ALL the same candidates – and they ALL used the same style “X” to mark their ballots. …I filed another public information request and received a handwritten sign out sheet for persons who had picked up packages of 50 or more applications for mailed ballots in 2018. Two concerning issues from that list. Federal Election Commission records show that US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee did make multiple payments to convicted forger Gloria Palmer in 2016."
Delta Variant Being Used For Next Round Of Liberty Suppression: CNN Fear Mongering,1 JUL 2021,1212,"Fear-mongering is all CNN has left. The Gateway Pundit reported: CNN rolled out Dr. Peter Hotez of Houston to scare the few people watching the fake news outlet into getting the Covid vaccine. “The Delta variant is like nothing we’ve seen before,” Dr. Hotez said as he made his case for vaccination. “This is twice as infectious as anything we’ve seen .. If you’re a young adult or adolescent, don’t listen to the anti-vaccine nonsense that says if you go to the gym and eat a healthy diet, that’s good enough — it’s not…” Not one word from the good doctor about how potentially dangerous the Covid jab is for adolescents. Myocarditis (heart inflammation) after the Covid-19 shot is “higher than expected” in young men and teen boys. But this doctor is telling healthy young adults and teens who have virtually zero chance of dying from Covid to put themselves at risk of Myocarditis rather than working out and eating right. They are NEVER going to let go of their power. Los Angeles County public health officials are now “strongly” recommending everybody – vaccinated and unvaccinated – wear a face mask indoors due to spread of the “Delta” variant.

Psaki Doubles Down On Lie That GOP Supports “Defunding Police”: Fails To Cite One Example,1 JUL 2021,2442,"Jen Psaki, like all democrats, has zero compunction lying. Summit News explained: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki doubled down Wednesday on her embarrassing claim that Republicans are the ones defunding police departments across the country, yet failed to name a single example when asked. Fox News’s Peter Doocy refused to drop the matter, telling Psaki “You mentioned, at the last briefing, that you think Republicans wanted to defund the police because they did not support the American Rescue Plan.” “Which Republican ever said that they did not like the American Rescue Plan because they wanted to defund the police?” Doocy asked, knowing that there are none. Psaki ignored the core question, and claimed that Republicans have “stood in the way of crucial funding needed to prevent the laying off of police officers as crimes increased,” but Doocy continued. “There are lots of examples of Democrats explicitly saying they want to defund the police,” the reporter asserted, adding “We’ve got Congresswoman Cori Bush, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar.” “Are there any examples of Republican members of Congress saying they want to defund the police?” Doocy again asked. “I think most people would argue that actions are more important than words, wouldn’t you say?” Psaki replied, again not providing an answer, and then further suggesting that Republicans failed to vote for police funding by voting against the Democrats bloated COVID relief bill. The absurdity of the Press Secretary’s claims is off the chart considering Democrat controlled Oakland voted this week to defund the police, in addition to Democratic lawmakers Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman all calling for defunding the police this week. The cities of Austin, Baltimore, Denver, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York City, Oakland, and Seattle have all suffered from police cutbacks and defunding within the past year, and they all happen to be run by Democrats. Sensing a pattern here? Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Unreal gaslighting as White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki doubles down on the insane notion that it's Republicans and not Democrats who have and continue to want to defund the police.

"Pathetic Bill Barr Tries To Salvage Career By Courting Rabid, Ignorant Left",28 JUN 2021,46519,"Bill Barr had the opportunity to be remembered as one of the greatest patriots ever… but he chose instead to bend his knee to communist slavery. Conservative Treehouse explained: There has been a lot of discussions today about an Atlantic article [SEE HERE] containing an outline of former AG Bill Barr’s discussion with reporters and the White House in the aftermath of the 2020 election.  In essence, the nub of the article is Bill Barr stating to a journalist December 1st: ” To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” and then the article covers the fallout with the White House from that AP interview. AG Barr called Michael Balsamo to his office in Main Justice to make the statement over lunch: ATLANTIC – […] Balsamo’s story appeared on the AP newswire shortly after lunch ended: “Disputing Donald Trump’s persistent baseless claims, Attorney General William Barr declared Tuesday the U.S. Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election.” The story blew a hole in the president’s claims. Nobody seriously questioned Barr’s conservative credentials or whether he had been among Trump’s most loyal cabinet secretaries. His conclusion sent a definitive message that the effort to overturn the election was without merit. (read more)
 That last paragraph perfectly encapsulates the entire purpose for AG Bill Barr to be in place since February of 2019.  To present the image of a loyal cabinet secretary so that no-one could/would question his conservative credentials.   That purpose was exactly what CTH presented upon the nomination and confirmation of Bill Barr.  His job was to be the bondo that covered the rot in DC and gave the illusion of a healthy functioning justice department.  We called it “Bondo Barr“. There is a specific irony of Bill Barr using Wayne County, Michigan, as “no evidence” of ballot fraud while simultaneously admitting no other area other than Wayne county has voting precincts that do not count ballots.  Only in Wayne county do the 662 precincts deliver ballots to a central counting facility.  The Wayne County process itself is designed specifically to make ballot fraud easier….  The former AG says move along, move along, nothing to see here… “that’s what they do.” The timing of this article released to coincide with the DOJ challenging election reforms in Georgia, combined with the Arizona audit finishing up their initial hand recount and verification of ballots, does not seem coincidental. As most CTH readers are aware the legislative, executive and judicial narrative engineers work in coordination with their media conscripts and at the behest of the intelligence apparatus.  In the private sector the BlackRock and Vanguard multinationals, and the CoC Wall Street, money builds the bridge to deliver the finished outcome. Under this process, the U.S. government is functioning exactly as it was designed when it was “fundamentally transformed”; the corrupt outcomes are a feature, not a flaw. Rather than use this article to once again draw attention to the corrupt intents and purposes of Bill Barr as the professional bondo applier, it is worth taking a pause to think carefully about another angle.   Think about all those voices, specifically pundits in media, who stood up to say Bill Barr is a man of integrity and will be the person to get to the bottom of the ‘spygate‘ corruption issues.   Remind yourself of exactly who those voices were…. Then recognize the intent of that drumbeat. That list would include: Trey Gowdy, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Jonah Goldberg, Kevin McCarthy, Marco Rubio, Sean Hannity, Sara Carter, John Solomon, Mark Levin, Laura Ingraham, Johnathan Turley, Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing etc. etc. Days after his confirmation in 2019 CTH noted something was sketchy about Bill Barr because of a very simple and common sense issue – everyone in/around DC knew Robert Mueller was in place to cover-up the corrupt DOJ and FBI activity and keep attacking the office of President Trump.  Not a single person in DC did not know this intention of the special counsel.  They never talked about it publicly, but every person in every office and every agency in DC knew Mueller’s purpose. In the first few weeks after his confirmation AG Bill Barr spent an extreme amount of time praising Robert Mueller for his work as special counsel and vouching for his integrity.  That continued praise for Mueller and Barr also heaping effusive praise on FBI Director Chris Wray, was when CTH accepted the brutally obvious, Bill Barr’s job was to apply Bondo to cover the rot. “Every day we spend outraged about what the DOJ and FBI did in 2016 and 2017, is one less day that AG Bill Barr is not being held accountable for all of this current DOJ and FBI corruption that stares him in the face when he brushes his teeth each morning.” ~ CTH, 2019 Barr played that outrage distraction game perfectly… Fox News ‘reported’ on President Trump’s response: This is a rush transcript from “Special Report” December 3, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Jesse. Animals are great.
Thanks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This may be the most
important speech I’ve ever made. This is not just about honoring the votes
of 74 million Americans who voted for me, it’s about ensuring that
Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, that is a portion of a video released by the White House a
short time ago in which President Trump lays out his case, insisting he
will continue to challenge last month’s election results. And gives his
strongest indication yet that he does in fact plan to run again in 2024 if
his efforts fail. Good evening, welcome to Washington. I’m Bret Baier. The most expansive
statement from President Trump since the November balloting usually a
speech like this that the president called as you heard, likely one of the
most important of his presidency would be covered by the White House press
pool, covered live or on tape and played back with an editorial presence in
the room. This was not done like that. The White House press pool was not
invited in. This was a White House edited video, there was no option to take it live.
It was posted on Facebook and a little piece on Twitter about an hour ago. Also tonight, a hearing at this hour in Michigan with presidential lawyer
Rudy Giuliani testifying before state lawmakers about alleged election
fraud. We’ll go there live shortly. But we begin tonight with his speech and with correspondent Kristin Fisher
live on the North Lawn of the White House. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,
Bret. This was a 45-minute long video posted directly to Twitter and
Facebook by the White House. The White House press pool was not even
notified that these remarks were about to be released. And President Trump said that this may be the most important speech that he
has ever delivered, even though most of what he said is at odds with what
his own Attorney General said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I want to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to expose the
tremendous voter fraud and irregularities which took place during the
ridiculously long November 3rd elections. We used to have what was called Election Day. Now we have election days,
weeks and months. And lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous
period of time, especially when you have to prove almost nothing to
exercise our greatest privilege, the right to vote. As president, I have no higher duty than to defend the laws and the
Constitution of the United States. That is why I am determined to protect
our election system, which is now under coordinated assault and siege. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER (on camera): Under coordinated assault and siege, quite the claim
from the President of the United States, especially when you take into
consideration what Chris Krebs who was the former Trump administration
cyber election — cybersecurity election official who was fired by the
president for saying that he believes this election, the 2020 election was
the most secure in U.S. history. You also have to consider what the Attorney General Bill Barr said just
yesterday, he said, and I quote, “To date, we have not seen fraud on a
scale that could have affected a different outcome in this election.” And a little bit later on in this video, President Trump continued to take
aim at Dominion Voting Systems that company that manufacturers so many
electronic voting machines across the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: And on top of everything else, we have a company that’s very
suspect. Its name is Dominion. With the turn of a dial or the change of a
chip, you could press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden, what
kind of a system is this? We have to go to paper. Maybe it takes longer,
but the only secure system is paper. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER (on camera): Now, the Attorney General also said yesterday that the
Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security looked into
these claims specifically about voting irregularities with these Dominion
voting machines. And the Attorney General said that they sought nothing to
substantiate those claims. You also have the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency putting
out a statement a few weeks ago saying that there is no evidence that any
voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way
compromised. Finally, and this was a long 45-minute address by the President, so I’m
trying to consolidate it, but the other entity or people that the president
attacked in this video were the judges who are hearing so many cases, so
many different lawsuits that have been brought forward by the Trump
campaign. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: It was about many other things. But above all, it was about fraud.
This election was rigged, everybody knows it. I don’t mind if I lose an
election. But I want to lose an election fair and square. What I don’t want
to do is have it stolen from the American people. That’s what we’re
fighting for. And we have no choice to be doing that. We already have the proof; we already have the evidence. And it’s very
clear. Many people in the media, and even judges so far have refused to
accept it. They know it’s true. They know it’s there. They know who won the
election. But they refuse to say, you’re right. Our country needs somebody
to say you’re right. Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result. And I
hope that Joe Biden is as well. But we already have the proof. We already
have tens of thousands of ballots more than we need to overturn all of
these states that we’re talking about. This is an election for the highest
office in the greatest country in the history of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER (on camera): Now, let’s go back to that one line from President
Trump where he said the judges have refused to accept it, refuse to accept
the evidence that his campaign has presented in court. I can’t go case by case again, because there are so many lawsuits in so
many states. But let’s just take that really big case in Pennsylvania,
which was tossed out by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and those three
judges, those three judges on that appeals court, they were all appointed
by Republican presidents and the judge that wrote that opinion, who said
that the Trump campaign had brought forward this lawsuit, that those claims
had no merit whatsoever, that judge was appointed by President Trump
himself. But Bret tonight, President Trump making it clear in this 45-minute video
that he is not giving up this fight and appears no closer to conceding. BAIER: Kristin, great job consolidating that in a very short time, not
knowing that it was coming to begin with, we appreciate that. FISHER: You bet. BAIER: We will have more with the panel which we’ll bring up to the front
of this show on this. Breaking right now, you can see here president —
presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani testifying this hour before state
lawmakers in Michigan about what the Trump campaign contends as voter fraud
there in last month’s election. Voter fraud they say that could change the
outcome of that state’s results. Correspondent Mark Meredith is live tonight in Lansing. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening to
you, Bret. Rudy Giuliani claims that there were multiple instances of
fraud, especially when it came to mail and balloting during last month’s
election. That’s what he’s expected to tell state lawmakers when he heads
into a hearing here behind me, a little bit of (INAUDIBLE) now it sounds
like he’s coming in right now. But already, this seat has certified its results, meaning that Joe Biden is
going to get the state’s electoral votes, likely that’s not going to
change. But Giuliani said late today he remains undeterred. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP’S LAWYER: The president does not intend to
give up. The president has seen more than enough evidence that this was a
massive fraud all over the country. We are going to prove it. We’re going
to prove it to the state legislatures, we’re going to prove it to the
court. MEREDITH (voice over): Giuliani won’t be the only one speaking tonight,
he’s expected to invite other people who claim to be eyewitnesses to
suspicious behavior around polling locations, especially out in Detroit. But the Republican chairman of the State House Oversight Committee told us
today, this is not about taking back Biden’s win. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The goal of this is not to overturn the election. The
goal of this is to find new laws that will help restore trust in elections
in Michigan. Also, our goal today is to allow people who have witnessed fraud to bring
their case forward. MEREDITH (voice over): But Democrats say this is all a waste of time. They
tweeted, COVID-19 is surging in Michigan and state Republicans are too busy
trying to soothe Trump’s sore ego with sham hearings to do anything about
it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MEREDITH (on camera): Republicans insist that they can focus on more than
just one thing at a time. And a live look here, you can see the crowd very
excited to see Rudy Giuliani as he heads into this hearing. It almost feels
like a mini Trump rally from what we used to see back on the campaign
trail. I’m told this is going to last no longer than three hours, but Bret, let’s
see what the night brings. Back to you, Bret. BAIER: That’s exactly right. We’ll follow up Mark live in Lansing,
Michigan. We have new information tonight about some of those alleged ballots
irregularities in last month’s election. Looking into a lot of them, we
have since the very beginning. Correspondent Kevin Corke looks at some of
the claims and whether they hold up against the facts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (Voice over): A barrage of
tweets and a cacophony of charges, all stemming from an intense election
integrity debate. PHILL KLINE, DIRECTOR OF THE AMISTAD PROJECT, THOMAS MORE SOCIETY: This
evidence demands investigation. This evidence demands answers. CORKE: The latest lamentations from the conservative leaning Amistad
Project of the Thomas More Society, which has provided testimony from
whistleblowers who’ve accused Postal Service workers of backdating,
tampering with or tossing out ballots ahead of the election. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People have been destroying ballots right and left, we
have shredded ballots. CORKE: But one of the many other voter fraud claims being made across the
country, many of which had been made by sworn affidavit. While Attorney
General Bill Barr said yesterday that the DOJ hadn’t concluded its
investigation into voter fraud during this election, concerns abound take
the popular claim that there were numerous Biden ballot dumps on election
night. And while it is true, the president did lead late in the evening on
election night. And yes, there was a massive increase of Biden votes
reported overnight. Even Kentucky Senator Rand Paul wondered about that. The fact is, many state officials say the surge was merely a reflection of
large city and county votes coming in late and more early vote being
tallied. Another claim, voting from the grave, a claim that is still being
investigated. Though Michigan State officials say it’s important to
remember that people do die after casting absentee or mail-in ballots, and
sometimes people who are here to be voting while dead simply share a
deceased person’s name and birthday. And Pennsylvania official said, for some, placeholder dates of birth on
voter rolls like January 1st 1800 are intentionally listed that way to
protect the identity of victims of domestic violence. And while the voter participation rate in each of the swing states was
unusually high in 2020. By itself, that’s not proof of a valid harvesting
conspiracy. And for the record, the president himself earned in excess of
11 million more votes than he did back in 2016. Dominion Voting Systems have also come under intense scrutiny. And while
Fox News has been unable to prove widespread fraud by Dominion,
vulnerabilities in its systems program were widely reported long before the
2020 election. (END VIDEO CLIP) CORKE (on camera): And those concerns Bret were actually rekindled after a
clerk error in Michigan gave Joe Biden thousands of votes which later had
to be returned to the Trump tally. As for the Amistad Project, I want to tell you this, that group claim says
as many as 288,000 ballots were “disappeared and vanished” after being
transported to Lancaster, Pennsylvania from New York. Additionally, the project says it has obtained sworn testimony that
suggests over 300,000 ballots are at issue in Arizona, more than a half
million in Michigan, 200,000 plus in Georgia and another 121,000 in
Pennsylvania. Again, not an exhaustive look at all the allegations of fraud, but a look,
Bret. BAIER: And we’ll continue that look. And we’ll continue to digest the
speech tonight by the president. Kevin, thank you. CORKE: You bet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: — challenge is fraud, it is important to know, the problems with
mail-in balloting, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and
most other states allowed anyone to get an absentee ballot and cast their
vote without showing any I.D. The voting took place entirely or the honor
system, no identification of any kind was required. Most Americans would also be shocked to learn that no state in the country
verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal
elections. This is a national disgrace. And on top of everything else, we have a company that’s very suspect, its
name is Dominion. With a turn of a dial, with a change of a chip, you could
press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden, what kind of a system
is this? We have to go to paper. Maybe it takes longer. But the only secure system
is paper. Not these systems that nobody understands, including in many
cases the people that run them. Although unfortunately, I think they
understand them far too well. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Again, that is the president of the United States in the White
House. 46 minutes that speech, a White House video edited produced there.
But again, posted on Facebook about an hour ago. We’re going to bring in our panel early, expanded panel, Mo Elleithee, the
executive director of Georgetown Institute of Politics. Susan Ferruccio,
Chief congressional correspondent for The Washington Examiner. Matthew
Continetti, founding editor of The Washington Free Beacon and we expect our
New York chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner in just
moments. Matthew, let me start with you. First of all, the president, if you thought
he was ready to throw in the towel here, 46 minutes tells you he’s not. He
also clearly makes the case in these 46 minutes that if he does not prevail
in his efforts, he is going to run again in 2024. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, FOUNDING EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON (on
camera): That’s right, Bret. And I think the political implications of the
speech are much more significant than the legal ones. I think it’s interesting to note the media in which the speech was
released. It was not a televised address; it went out over Trump’s social
media accounts. And, of course, that’s a direct feed to his most loyal
supporters. But the president also has, I think, a very um political tightrope to walk
here. He made one reference in the speech to the Georgia runoff elections
in January, which will be held the day before the Congress needs to certify
the Electoral College vote. And so, there’s a real risk here that as he continues to challenge the
election, he will — he will also delegitimize the electoral process in the
eyes of many Republican voters, and that’s possibly handing the Senate to
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. BAIER: Mo, I mean, the speech was pretty detailed at parts where he went
into specific allegations from specific people that they have affidavits
from around the country. He went into specifics about how he’s disappointed
about the Durham report not coming out before the election. And that who
knows, he says, if it’s going to come out before he leaves the office. This is a president that is still fighting to the end. Kristin Fisher laid
out the attorney general’s comments, Chris Krebs, and others that have
pointed the other way. MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Yes, I
don’t think he’s fighting to the end, I think he’s flailing to the end. I
mean, look, this speech was, I mean, it’s Festivus come early. It was an
airing of grievances. But the problem is most of these grievances were
weren’t true. Look, if I was a Trump supporter, I would be very frustrated right now. He
keeps saying there is allegations of — there’s evidence of fraud. He
didn’t bring it to the attorney general who has said there isn’t any. He
didn’t bring him to court, in fact, judges many of whom were appointed by
him or several of whom that were appointed by him said there’s no fraud
here. And in fact, asked Rudy Giuliani and other — others from the president’s
legal team, are you alleging fraud in under oath? They said, no. So, whatever the theatrics, whatever they’re saying these theatrical
productions, under oath, they’re saying, no, we’re not alleging any sort of
widespread fraud that could have changed the election. So, this is — I think it’s — if I was a Trump supporter, I’d be very
frustrated by all this. And I think, Matthew’s point is really, really
important. What the president is doing is undermining the credibility of
the electoral process, just as he is trying to mobilize his supporters to
participate in a special election. He’s supposed to go down to Georgia. What’s he going to do when he goes
down there to campaign? Is he going to actually talk about the Republican
candidates or is he going to use it as another platform to talk about how
the election was rigged and turn his voters off from participating in the
process? He’s doing a lot of damage here to the country and to his own
party. BAIER: Yes. Mo, I want to take you live to Michigan. We have Rudy Giuliani
sitting down, ready to do this presentation in front of state. Lawmakers
there, it’s something we saw similar to what happened in Arizona where we
brought you sound bites from that presentation, there Jenna Ellis as well. Sometimes the president has called into these presentations live and made
some statements for that as well. Susan, just to clarify what Mo said about the attorney general,
specifically what Barr said is to the A.P., to date, we have not seen fraud
on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election. In other words, it’s not that he hasn’t seen fraud, it’s that he hasn’t
seen it on the scale that could determine the election. What the White
House said today is that it hasn’t gone through his desk, and maybe they’re
splitting Harris here, Susan, but that’s what Kayleigh McEnany said from
the press briefing room. SUSAN FERRUCCIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER
(on
camera): Right. I think, you know, the anecdotal stuff, it is really
concerning and the things that the president and Rudy Giuliani are talking
about should be looked into. Well, there’s always some forms of election fraud every election. I think
the case that the president’s making is that there was a mass coordinated
effort to overturn this election and hand it to Joe Biden and steal it from
him. And he bases it on the fact that the night on November 3rd, it looked like
he was headed to a win, and then, the next day, all the votes shifted
toward Biden. And, of course, that has a lot to do with the way the votes
were counted and the different types of votes that came in: mail-in, early
voting, absentee. All of that uncoordinated because every state has their
own process. And what President Trump has done though really is undermine Biden’s win
for his base. They will see Biden as an illegitimate president, much the
way that Democrats saw the president as an illegitimate president because
they believed he coordinated with the Russians to win office. BAIER: Right. FERRUCCIO: So, it’s more of this partisan back and forth undermining our
electoral process. BAIER: Yes. FERRUCCIO: And then, you have Bill Barr saying, I don’t see anything here
at this point. And I think that’s probably where he’s going to end up
ultimately. BAIER: Right. I want to bring in Byron York, we got the gremlins figured
out. Byron, let me just talk for a second about the logistics here. If
you’re trying to get this message to the most people out there, why not
bring the White House press pool in with the live capabilities? I mean, Fox would have taken it live, other channels probably wouldn’t
have, but we would have. Why not do that? BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Well, the first thing
is, he really wouldn’t want to answer questions about this. And the
president who was enormously accessible to the press before the election
has not been accessible to the press after the election. So, I think that’s
one reason. But, you know, the time is just running out here it’s been quite a while
since the election. In 12 days, the Electoral College will meet. The major
states have certified the results of their election in Georgia. There has
been a hand recount and a machine recount. He would need to overturn the results in not one, not two, but three
states. And, you know, most Republicans have to have moved on past this,
and they’re concerned mostly about winning those two Senate seats in
Georgia, and not about somehow miraculously changing the results of this
presidential election. BAIER: Yes, we’re covering all of it. Panel, thank you very much. See you a
little bit later in the show. Coming up, an emotional day on the Senate floor. Plus, what is next with
COVID? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: The world has just passed the 64 million mark in coronavirus
infections. The U.S. is closing in on 14 million cases with more than
272,000 deaths as of tonight. This is the fight over restrictions goes on. City leaders in Beverly Hills
are demanding Los Angeles County repeal its outdoor dining ban. They say
the order is detrimental to local businesses and is not based on scientific
evidence. Austin, Texas Democrat Mayor Steve Adler is the latest public official
being accused of hypocrisy tonight. He reportedly was on vacation at a
timeshare in Mexico, when he told his constituents to stay home and not
travel because of the virus. A couple from Hawaii was arrested Sunday after boarding a flight despite
having tested positive for COVID-19. Fox affiliate in Honolulu, reports the
couple faces a reckless endangerment charge after trying to take a plane
from San Francisco to Lihue, Hawaii. British regulators have become the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine
for emergency use. Distribution set to begin in the U.K. next week. And
Russian President Vladimir Putin is ordering mass vaccinations to start
next week in his country with its Sputnik V vaccine. The CDC is once again asking Americans to rethink their holiday travel
plans, this time for Christmas and New Year’s. Also tonight, we’re learning
additional details about the policy for getting vaccines to Americans. Senior correspondent Laura Engel reports tonight from New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: It’s one of the things that gives us, of course, great hope. LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): December is
shaping up to be a busy month in the race for a vaccine, now that two
COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been submitted for FDA approval. Both Pfizer and Moderna appear on track to be approved with millions of
doses that could be shipped and distributed by the end of the month for
frontline healthcare workers and those living in long-term care facilities. ALEX AZAR, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Of course,
we’re all eager to have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants
it. And because of Operation Warp Speed, we expect to be at that point in
the spring. INGLE: Hard hit Texas, announcing today it will get 1.4 million initial
doses of the coronavirus vaccine for the month of December. Those working
with elderly patients who have been deemed top priority say that
designation gives them a sign of hope. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let’s protect those who need the most protection right
now. And eventually, all get taken care of. INGLE: As the nation looks ahead to what may come next, Dr. Anthony Fauci,
says if a majority of Americans get the vaccine by the middle to the end of
April of next year, that’s when we could see things really start to turn
around. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS
DISEASES: Which means you’d have herd immunity that would allow you to
safely get people back to the kinds of works that would otherwise be
difficult as you get to the middle and end of the summer. INGLE: Just hours ago, the CDC officially released revised guidance on
quarantine time for those who may have been exposed to the coronavirus and
have tested negative. The director of the CDC, saying data has led them to
make the change from 14 days to 7 days. And those who have not been tested
have to quarantine for 10. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGLE (on camera): Here in New York, Governor Cuomo said today that the
first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine should be around 170,000 doses for
170,000 people, and could be here by December 15th. And those first rounds
of doses will go to nursing home residents and staff. Bret? BAIER: Laura, thank you. Stocks were mixed today. The Dow gained 60, the S&P 500 rose seven,
finishing at another record high close. The NASDAQ lost six today. Up next, the latest on the balance of power in the House. Plus — (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): How reassuring it is to wait to be weighing a
thorny question, and see Lamar Alexander sitting across, across the table. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: A rare sight. Senator McConnell with an emotional goodbye to a
colleague and horrific claims of voter fraud in Georgia experienced by the
secretary of state himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGIA: Here is something that
came to our house yesterday, and it’s to my son Brenton J. Raffensberger
who passed away two years ago. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Fifty-five uncounted ballots have been discovered in a yet to be
called congressional race in upstate New York. Republican Claudia Tenney is
trying to unseat Democrat incumbent Anthony Brindisi. The current balance
of power, 222 Democrats to 208 Republicans, five races still uncalled. We are less than five weeks away from the runoffs in Georgia that will
determine which party controls the power in the U.S. Senate for the next
two years at least, and the effort to win by any means necessary is
becoming more aggressive on both sides. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie has
the latest tonight from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the battle for control of the
Senate continues in Georgia, the state’s top elections official has
launched an investigation into liberal groups allegedly attempting to
register residents who are out-of-state or deceased to vote in the January
5th runoffs. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he received
multiple solicitations from the New Georgia Project, an organization
founded by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and chaired until
January by Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock. BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R) GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: Here’s something that
came to our house yesterday. We got three of them, all from the same
organization. And it’s to my son, Brenton J. Raffensperger, who passed away
two years ago. SERRIE: In an effort to exploit divisions among Republicans, a progressive
political action committee has purchased ad space on nine billboards,
stating senators Perdue and Loeffler didn’t deliver for Trump, don’t
deliver for them. GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIAL: Discouraging people from
voting is not the right way to go about this. Fight about your values,
argue, engage, persuade. SERRIE: The billboard campaign comes amid ongoing legal challenges by
Trump loyalists alleging widescale voter fraud. Georgia’s Republican
secretary of state says the allegations are unfounded, and he’s fighting
legal efforts by a group of Republican electors to inspect the state’s new
voting machines. Experts say most Georgians have already made up their
minds about whether they support the incumbents or Democratic challengers
Warnock and Jon Ossoff. ANDRA GILLESPIE, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: This election is about
turnout. It’s not really about persuasion. So even though some of the ads
and the content of the ads might try to persuade that small sliver of
undecided voters, those would be low propensity voters who would be less
likely to show up. (END VIDEO TAPE) SERRIE (on camera): And midnight is the deadline for Georgia’s 159
counties to finish a statewide machine count of presidential ballots, 132
counties have already finished their tallies, leaving 27 others working
into the night to meet the deadline. Bret? BAIER: We’ll be down there soon. Jonathan, thank you, from Atlanta. Please join us Sunday night for the debate between Senator Kelly Loeffler
and Democrat Raphael Warnock. Martha MacCallum anchors our coverage
starting at 6:45 p.m. eastern time, Sunday. A Democratic North Carolina state lawmaker is blaming the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and career politicians for failing to defeat
incumbent Republican Thom Tillis in last month’s election. Democrat nominee
Cal Cunningham’s campaign was hampered by a sex scandal late in that
campaign. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blaming his loss on his
inability, quote, “to keep his zipper up.” That’s according to “Axios.” Former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly is now a U.S. senator from Arizona. Kelly
was sworn in today by Vice President Mike Pence to serve the final two
years of the late John McCain’s term. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave an emotional farewell today
to longtime colleague Lamar Alexander. The Tennessee senator is retiring at
the end of his term. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I myself have leaned on
Lamar’s wisdom for many years. But I think I’ve leaned just as much on his
optimism, his can-do spirit, his ability to look on the bright side, and to
discern how some more hard work can make it brighter still. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Alexander was first elected to the Senate in 2002. He was reelected
twice, ran for president as well. Up next, while Joe Biden concentrates on his economic plan, Republicans
attack one of his economic advisors to be. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: President-elect Joe Biden focusing on small business tonight while
his political rivals are focusing on one of his picks to be on his economic
team. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports this evening from Wilmington,
Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The president-elect spent the day
listening to people hurt by the COVID-19 economy. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Tell me about what your real, deep
concerns are. I’d like to hear it. DOOCY: As Republicans spent the day sounding off on Biden’s choice to be
the director at the Office of Management and Budget, whose past comments
have offended progressive and conservatives, Neera Tanden. SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR): There is no chance Neera Tanden is going to be
confirmed. She might as well step aside, or Joe Biden might as well
withdraw her and go back to the drawing board. DOOCY: But Biden is not backing down, telling “The New York Times,” “She’s
smart as hell. Yes, I think they’re going to pick a couple people just to
fight over no matter what.” Biden’s West Wing is filling up with Obama
alumni. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I’m confident. This is an experienced group. DOOCY: As Obama himself surveys the landscape and delivers a warning for
some progressive activists. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I guess you can use a snappy smell
good like “defund the police,” but you know you’ve lost a big audience the
minute you said it. DOOCY: Not so according to Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar who tweets
“We lose people in the hands of the police. It’s not a slogan, but a policy
demand.” The FBI Director Chris Wray’s job is safe. Biden plans to let him continue
filling out his 10-year term. The attorney general will not be Bill Barr,
who got Biden’s attention saying there’s not proof of enough fraud to
overturn election results. “The New York Times” reports, quote “Biden joked
that Barr had just called him, asking if I could get him in the witness
protection program for endorsing me.” Biden keeps calling on Congress to
pass COVID relief in the lame duck session, but he still hasn’t spoken to
Mitch McConnell. BIDEN: My hope is that’ll be able to help in a short order, but that
depends a lot on our friends in Congress and the other side who are
prepared to take the action that has to be taken. (END VIDEO TAPE) DOOCY (on camera): Whoever Biden nominates to run the Interior Department
will not be his first choice because sources close to the transition are
telling us that New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham was offered
Interior and turned it down. This is the first known instance of Biden
being turned down during the transition. Bret? BAIER: OK, Peter Doocy live in Wilmington, Delaware. Peter, thanks. Up next, the panel on President Trump’s continued fight to try to reverse
last month’s election results, and if that fails, his apparent desire to
run again in 2024. This is a live look at the president’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani talking to
witnesses about voter fraud he says alleged to state lawmakers in Michigan.
Let’s listen in as we head to break. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you hear me now? RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP’S ATTORNEY: Can everyone hear her clearly? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can hear you. GIULIANI: OK. Now, the supervisor — the supervisor you originally had
when you were first there, did you observe her coaching voters to vote for
— (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It’s been an amazing
four years. We’re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you
in four years. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Some cellphone video there from one of the many Christmas parties
still going on at the White House. The president saying if it doesn’t
happen this time, he will see you in four years. Let’s bring back our panel, Mo, Susan, Byron, and Matthew. Matthew, he is
laying the groundwork here. The question is, if its efforts fail, as a lot
of people suspect they will, what does it look like from now until whenever
in two years? Is he still the daily obsession for most of the media if he
is out there in this kind of limbo place? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, “WASHINGTON FREE BEACON”: A lot of
that depends on the media, Bret. And the media is going to have to make
some editorial decisions about how they covered this ex-president. It’s
going to be very hard for them to ignore Donald Trump. I went back in the
archives. As late as December 1979, there were articles appearing in “The
New York Times” making the case for ex-president Gerald Ford to run in the
1980 Republican primary. So I expect the shadow of the potential Trump
candidacy will loom over the GOP for years to come. BAIER: Meantime, there is this back-and-forth in the Democrat Party, Mo.
And this is former President Obama about defund police. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: If you believe, as I do, that we
should be able to reform the criminal justice system so that it’s not
biased and treats everybody fairly, I guess you can use a snappy slogan
like “defund the police,” but you know you’ve lost a big audience the
minute you said it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually
going to get the changes you want done. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Some progressives pushed back on that. What does that look like
inside the Democratic Party heading into 2021? MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: I
think President Obama articulated what a majority of Democrats think,
including the president-elect, including Joe Biden, that reforming polices
is one thing, that demanding accountability is one thing, but defunding is
not something where a majority of the party is. And look, there is going to continue to be a little bit of a push and pull
between progressives and the new administration. But so far, Joe Biden has
sort of drawn lines where he disagrees with them and has said don’t expect
me to cave on a few of these things. Whether it was defunding the police or
standing up against Medicare for all, he has come out and said, look, I am
not for these things. So let’s see where we can agree. But you are not
going to push me on these things. And that’s how he campaigned, and I think
that’s where he is now. BAIER: He had this interview with Tom Friedman in “The New York Times,”
Mo, and he seemed to suggest that he could cave on Neera Tanden, if it
doesn’t go well or if she’s not going to get through. He said, sometimes
they are going to take a few off your list. Do you believe that? ELLEITHEE: I think what he saying, if I read that correctly, was there are
going to be a couple of people out there that Republicans are just going to
fight on just to take a stand. But he’s standing by her. And it’s up to the
Senate, and that’s why Georgia is going to be so important. BAIER: All right, Susan, this NDAA, this is the National Defense
Authorization Act, the president tweeting, “Section 230, which is a
liability shielding gift from the U.S. to Big Tech (the only companies in
America that have it — corporate welfare) that is a serious threat to our
national security and election integrity. Our country can never be safe or
secure if we allow it to stand. Therefore, if the very dangerous and unfair
Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the NDAA I will be
forced to unequivocally veto the bill when it’s sent to the very beautiful
Resolute Desk. Take back America now. Thank you.” Susan, obviously, it’s still going forward. This is the defense bill. SUSAN FERRECHIO, “WASHINGTON EXAMINER”: Right. And it sounds like there
may be enough Republicans potentially to override a veto. James Inhofe, the
Armed Services Committee chairman, today said that he is keeping that
language that the president desires out of the bill. He thinks it belongs
in the Commerce Committee, not the Armed Services Committee. And Congress does not like when extraneous things get stuffed into the
defense bill, because the military likes to plan, they like to have that
authorization measure done on time. Congress is very sensitive to that. And
so I think the president has run into some real opposition in his own
party, even the Republicans largely agree with him that Section 230 needs a
complete rewrite for a variety of reasons. A lot of Democrats feel the same
way. This just isn’t the place for it. BAIER: Right, it is a big issue. Byron, finally, the COVID stimulus
possibilities, there is now three up there. Any possibility? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, “WASHINGTON EXAMINER”: You
would think that there would be given that there is bipartisan support for
some amount of aid. And we’re entering this period in which the number of
cases seems to be going up so quickly in some parts of the country. I think
when the history of this period is written, people will be absolutely
astonished that you had a pandemic of this seriousness that had this much
economic effect on people, and Congress didn’t do anything for such a long
period of time. And at some point, they will all have to answer to that. BAIER: Yes, that’s a big, big issue. Panel, thanks, and thanks for the
hustle, getting to the A block. We appreciate it. When we come back, a look at sports and healing. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, supporting each other. It is a busy time of the
year for delivery drivers, but when FedEx driver Aubrey Robinson noticed
11-year-old Elijah Maines playing basketball and a rusty old hoop, she
decided to give him an early Christmas present. On her day off, Robinson
bought him a new hoop and basketball. Well, that’s cool. And in England, Zach Bliden (ph) is jumping for joy and a cause. After four
months of chemo treatment, the seven-year-old is in remission. Following
his battle, he raised thousands of dollars for Oxford Hospital charity by
bouncing on his pogo stick, a lot. Keep bouncing, congratulations. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. And that is it for the
SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. I’ll be off for the next
couple of days dealing with a family health issue. Thanks for all of your
prayers and your good wishes. Tune in Sunday for Martha’s coverage of the

London Street Protests: People Uprising Against Insane COVID Lockdowns,28 JUN 2021,1058,"This weekend, the people of Great Britain rose up and massive protests against COVID lockdowns took place. Conservative Treehouse reported: Thousands of people descended on London’s Hyde Park on Saturday afternoon in the latest round of protests against Covid lockdown measures. The crowds marched through Oxford Street before gathering at Hyde Park while holding banners, placards and flags. The crowds of protesters (bottom left and bottom centre) marched through Oxford Street, Regent Street, Hyde Park and Northumberland Avenue as they held placards reading ‘freedom is not for trade’, ‘no to Covid vaccine’ and ‘no to the Covid passport’. Demonstrators also made their way to Downing Street, with crowds setting off flares and chanting loudly with people heard shouting “shame on you” and pointing towards Number 10, followed by prolonged booing. Shirley Jones, a librarian from Crystal Palace, said: “I’d rather be doing something else with my weekend but I’m going to keep coming on these protests because I don’t trust what the Government is doing.  "
Delta Variant Gives WHO ‘Reason’ To Recommend Masks And Social Distancing Forever,28 JUN 2021,2124,"Globalists don’t want freedom for individuals, so they are revamping the masks, lockdowns, and social distancing ‘recommendations’ because of a supposed ‘new variant’ of COVID. CDP reported months ago that the deadly nature of the vaccine would require a new ‘strain’ to provide an excuse for the massive numbers of vaccine deaths on the horizon… God forbid, but this may be it. The Gateway Pundit reported: The China-funded World Health Organization (WHO) is recommending masks and social distancing for everyone – vaccinated and unvaccinated – due to the Covid “Delta” variant. “Vaccine alone won’t stop community transmission,” Dr. Mariangela Simao, WHO’s assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products, said. “People need to continue to use masks consistently, be in ventilated spaces, hand hygiene … the physical distance, avoid crowding. This still continues to be extremely important, even if you’re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing.” Fox News reported: As the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus gained traction around the world, the World Health Organization urged vaccinated people to continue to wear masks and social distance, according to reports. The recommendation comes weeks after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said vaccinated people can go most places without masks. However, federal mandates remain on airplanes, for example. The vaccines are considered “highly effective” against the delta variant, according to a recent study by the British government, although slightly less than the original strain. But the WHO urged those vaccinated to “play it safe” and wear a mask because so many remain unvaccinated globally and the variant has become the main spreader in several countries, CNBC reported. Authoritarians are already using the “Delta” variant to justify a new round of lockdowns and mandates. The Australian city of Sydney just went into a two-week hard lockdown after more than 80 new cases of the “Delta” variant of Covid-19 were confirmed. Israel reinstated its mask mandate because of the “Delta” variant."
Jailed Murderer Wins Public Office Election In Washington D.C.,24 JUN 2021,5058,"As Washington D.C. continues its plunge into violent devolution, the city has catalogued a new victory… an inmate is now holding public office. Judicial Watch explained: As the homicide rate hits a record high in Washington D.C. the city elects a convicted murderer to public office in a unique election featuring all inmate candidates. The freshly elected public official, Joel Caston, has been in prison 26 years and is currently incarcerated at the District of Columbia Jail. In 1996 Caston was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder for ambushing and killing a man in the city’s Anacostia neighborhood. Court records obtained by Judicial Watch indicate that a 2016 appeal was denied. In the document, Caston’s attorneys name the victim, which is not common practice today. Court records also reveal a “speed loader”—a device used to rapidly load ammunition into a firearm—was found by police under Caston’s mattress after the shooting. It contained six rounds of .44 caliber ammunition as well as additional rounds of ammo. Now Caston is a commissioner on D.C.’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC), which advises the D.C. Council and other local government entities involving matters ranging from liquor license applications to public safety. Commissioners serve two-year terms and are elected in even-numbered years. The ANC was established to bring “government closer to the people, and to bring the people closer to government,” according to its website. Caston was chosen by voters to represent Ward 7, one of D.C.’s most crime-infested areas. It is represented by Councilman Vince Gray, an ex-D.C. mayor who was embroiled in a campaign finance scandal. The Ward 7 ANC seat has never been occupied and D.C. officials conducted an unprecedented election earlier this month to fill the post. All five candidates and the majority of voters they courted are incarcerated at the same prison with Caston, according to a local news report. Last year the D.C. Council passed legislation allowing incarcerated convicted felons to vote. Besides D.C. only two states—Maine and Vermont—let imprisoned criminals cast ballots, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. After the measure was enacted in D.C., a group of commissioners and a nonprofit called Neighbors for Justice launched an effort to fill the empty ANC seat and pressure the local  Department of Corrections to notify inmates they qualified to run for the post. Neighbors for Justice was founded in August 2020 by residents near the D.C. prison who want to support “neighbors at the jail during COVID and beyond.” The group offered all the felon candidates a forum to deliver their campaign message from their cell clad in orange prison uniforms. In the promotional campaign videos Caston is the only candidate who is not wearing the orange uniform. Instead, he appears in a white sweatshirt with a logo that reads “credible messenger.” In the short segment Caston says “my platform would be used to restore the dignity of incarcerated people that we would no longer be judged by our worst mistake and establish equality for both the male and the female population that has often been overlooked inside this space.” Caston will be issued a laptop or tablet, an electronic mail account, and a workspace in the prison where he can dedicate eight hours a day to his duties as commissioner, the founder of Neighbors for Justice said in a local newspaper article. “It’s not just about a historic election, with a first-ever ANC commissioner who is incarcerated,” said Julie Johnson, the group’s founder. “It’s about giving a voice and visibility to a population that is unseen.” In the same story Caston says that he feels “presidential” after winning the election. On its website Neighbors for Justice congratulates Caston, writing that he will serve as the ward’s inaugural commissioner and confirming that the murderer received 48 of the 142 votes cast in the “historic election.” The note proudly announces that “all five candidates in this election are in residence at the DC jail.” While they celebrate the election triumph of a convicted murderer, homicides in D.C. are on pace to shatter records. Last year the rate hit a 16-year high and in 2021 it is expected to be worse, according to Metropolitan Police Department data. The figures show homicides are already up 13% from last year. A few months ago, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser declared that gun violence is a public health crisis. Weeks later she clumped her city’s pervasive gun violence with the COVID-19 pandemic, saying this in a statement: “Many communities across the nation, including Washington, DC, continue to be burdened by two simultaneous public health emergencies. The first is the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit our Black and Latino communities the hardest. The second is the gun-related violence that continues to devastate many of those same communities. Even in 2020, when much of the country shut down for weeks at a time, deaths from gun violence reached historic levels.”"
Woke Restaurant Begins Charging White People 15% More ‘Equity Charge’: Civil Rights Act Ignored,24 JUN 2021,12310,"In Minnesota, a woke restaurant has decided to ignore the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and charge people more, based on the color of their skin. FEE reported: “Where should we eat tomorrow?” my wife asked me excitedly as we sat on our deck Friday evening. She had locked down a babysitter for Saturday night, and we were both eager for our first dinner date alone together in months. “Broders’,” I answered without hesitation. Located in southwest Minneapolis, Broders Pasta Bar is a local gem. It has a great outdoor patio and the best Italian cuisine in the Twin Cities. We had not eaten there since the pandemic began. My wife nodded and started to make a reservation on her phone. Then her jaw dropped. “You’re not going to like this,” she said. An Equity Charge? She was right. On its website, Broders’ has a notice to customers notifying them of a new 15 percent “benefits and equity” charge they’ve instituted. They justify the charge, first, by explaining that “many states have allowed reduced minimum wages for service staff in the form of a tip credit.” (More on this in a minute.) The restaurant’s second justification is that many tippers are racist and sexist, according to uncited research. “Studies have also shown that there is inequity and built-in bias in the way consumers give tips,” the statement reads. “In general, Black or Brown servers receive less tips than Caucasian servers. There is gender bias as well.” The final part of the statement says the new policy stems from wider racial injustice and is not a substitute for gratuity. “In the wake of racial injustice protests and the closures due to Covid, now is the time for Broders’ to reimagine its economics and provide fair pay across the company,” the statement reads. “Our Benefits & Equity Charge is applied entirely to employee compensation. This supplement helps us to set a $16 minimum hourly wage for customer facing employees, $18 minimum hourly wage for kitchen employees… Altogether this allows everyone in our company to earn a real living wage. The 15% Benefits & Equity Charge is not a gratuity.” The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Broders’ is of course free to add this additional charge, but there are few things that should be noted. First, it’s true that many states allow tipped employees to make less than the minimum wage. However, Minnesota is not one of those states. Businesses with gross revenue over $500,000 are legally required to pay employees—including tipped workers—at least $10.08 an hour. (For businesses with gross revenue less than $500,000, the minimum wage is $8.21.) For Broders’ to include this sentence—”many states have allowed reduced minimum wages”—for a justification of its equity policy while fully knowing this policy is not in use in Minnesota is nothing short of deceptive. Second, I’m no Robert Irvine, but telling your customers you are going to begin charging them more because they are too bigoted to tip fairly might not be a winning restaurant strategy. Just sayin’. As a former restaurant worker, I pride myself on being a generous and fair tipper, and the implication that I can’t be trusted with this responsibility doesn’t sit well with me. Finally, if Broders’ doesn’t feel restaurant workers in the back are earning enough money, there is a solution to that: pay them more. This action doesn’t require any surcharges or public lectures on systemic oppression. It only requires the restaurant to run an efficient and profitable business that allows them to pay workers a wage they believe is fair and “livable.” The Fixed (Pizza) Pie Fallacy Out of curiosity, I looked around to see if other restaurants are adding similar charges. I quickly found one. Pizzeria Toro, a North Carolina restaurant, recently announced that it is introducing a 20 percent Living Wage Fee. The pizzeria’s owner, Gray Brooks, said this is the “equitable” thing to do. “In order for the bottom to rise up, the top has to come down a little bit,” said Brooks. This is, of course, a perfect example of the fixed pie fallacy. For those unfamiliar, the fallacy assumes that the economy is fixed, and for the poor to do better, the better off must simply sacrifice more. “If we assume that wealth is a fixed pie, then the more slices the rich get, the fewer are left over for the poor,” Chelsea Follett explained. “In other words, people can only better themselves at the expense of others. In the world of the fixed pie, if we observe the rich becoming richer, then it must be because other people are becoming poorer. Fortunately, in the real world, the pie is not fixed.” That the fixed pie is a fallacy is clear. New matter cannot be created, but new value can be. Value is created every time two parties make a voluntary exchange. And the market economy is a vast network of trillions upon trillions of value-creating exchanges. The market economy’s “pie” of value grows with every “win-win” exchange. So, there’s no need for “win-lose” transfers from have-mores to have-lesses. Historically, the poor have been helped much more by the freedom and opportunity to participate in the market than from wealth transfers (whether in the form of charity or taxation). And the most poverty-alleviating way to use private wealth has not been to give it away, but to invest it in capital goods, which boosts labor productivity and thus lifts up real wages. Just look at the rise of per capita income since the 18th century, which shows “the growing pie” of the market benefited everyone. The owners of these establishments are free to run their businesses as they like (just as I’m free to take my business elsewhere). But, if they really care about uplifting their workers, they should worry less about corporate virtue-signaling and more about actually improving their business. And if they still have bandwidth to do some good after that, they might work on opposing all the myriad ways—the minimum wage, occupational licensing, etc—that government gets in the way of workers participating in and benefiting from “growing the pie.” “Most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another,” Milton Friedman once observed. The Danger of Focusing on Equity One of the reasons the fixed pie fallacy persists, no doubt, is this hyperfocus on equity. Some might look at equity surcharges as just a shrewd ploy for restaurants to get more for their workers, but that doesn’t mean they are benign. Focusing on equity tends to place labor and business at odds, implying that workers are being exploited and deprived of their fair share. This idea—that the employer-employee relationship is inherently exploitative—is grounded in Marxism, and has been effectively refuted by economists. This mindset taps into resentment and class struggle, two pillars of socialism, and teaches people to see the world through the lens of oppression and conflict. To be sure, in a new twist, restaurants appear to be trying to pass this alleged exploitation onto customers, perhaps to placate disgruntled workers or maybe to tap into social justice currents. But this doesn’t make the ideas less harmful. Whatever the case, I suspect attempts to make customers pay “equity” chargers will backfire. Customers like having choices. That’s one of the many beauties of markets. Consumers can choose how we respond to things. If you don’t like Twitter’s aggressive policies on speech, fine; you can go somewhere else. If you don’t care for Chick fil A’s charitable donations, you can eat at Popeye’s. If a car dealership treats you poorly, you can take your business elsewhere. And if you don’t like your favorite restaurant’s new equity surcharge policy, you can simply exercise the power of exit—and I intend to. The choice for me was simple: My favorite restaurant added an equity surcharge. What should I do? I will not be eating at Broders’ again, I’m sad to say. At least not while I’m being slapped with equity charges. The Gateway Pundit added: Broders’ Pasta Bar in Minnesota announced it is adding a 15% “equity charge” to all bills because its customers are racist tippers. The Conservative Playlist has the full story. Here is their announcement. WHAT IS THE BENEFITS & EQUITY CHARGE? Historically, restaurants have relied on customer tipping to supplement the wages of its customer-facing service staff. It is part of a traditional restaurant economic model and many states have allowed reduced minimum wages for service staff in the form of a tip credit. Studies have also shown that there is inequity and built-in bias in the way consumers give tips. In general, Black or Brown servers receive less tips than Caucasian servers. There is gender bias as well. In restaurants, immigrants and people of color work mostly in the kitchens and have no access to gratuities to supplement their hourly wage. Because Minnesota state law does not allow a tip credit and does not allow restaurants to pool tips, only the direct-facing service employee can decide if there should be sharing of tips among other service workers. Increased menu prices constitute higher tips which, along with increased minimum wages, adds to the disparity between the front customer-facing service staff and back of house kitchen staff. In the wake of racial injustice protests and the closures due to Covid, now is the time for Broders’ to reimagine its economics and provide fair pay across the company. Minnesota does not allow restaurants to impose an automatic gratuity and pool tips. What we can do is impose a Benefits & Equity Charge on our sales that is not a gratuity. Our Benefits & Equity Charge is applied entirely to employee compensation. This supplement helps us to set a $16 minimum hourly wage for customer facing employees, $18 minimum hourly wage for kitchen employees (more with increased responsibility) above all government standards, to provide benefits of paid time off & health insurance, and to distribute 5% of daily revenue to all employees based on hours worked. Altogether this allows everyone in our company to earn a real living wage. The 15% Benefits & Equity Charge is not a gratuity. This means any small gratuities left on top are completely discretionary, but if you choose to tip it will be distributed to only the customer-facing service staff. Just in case you need a refresher course on the Civil Rights Act (eh hm, democrats) the government explains: Legal Highlight: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 In the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of “equal protection of the laws” expected the president, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment. In response, all three branches of the federal government–as well as the public at large–debated a fundamental constitutional question: Does the Constitution’s prohibition of denying equal protection always ban the use of racial, ethnic, or gender criteria in an attempt to bring social justice and social benefits? In June 1963, President John Kennedy asked Congress for a comprehensive civil rights bill, induced by massive resistance to desegregation and the murder of Medgar Evers. After Kennedy’s assassination in November, President Lyndon Johnson pressed hard, with the support of Roy Wilkins and Clarence Mitchell, to secure the bill’s passage the following year. In 1964, Congress passed Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 241). The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Provisions of this civil rights act forbade discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as, race in hiring, promoting, and firing. The Act prohibited discrimination in public accommodations and federally funded programs. It also strengthened the enforcement of voting rights and the desegregation of schools. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the nation’s benchmark civil rights legislation, and it continues to resonate in America. Passage of the Act ended the application of “Jim Crow” laws, which had been upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be “separate but equal” was constitutional. The Civil Rights Act was eventually expanded by Congress to strengthen enforcement of these fundamental civil rights."
Mysterious McAfee Q Drop Posted 30 Mins After His ‘Suicide’: Wife Speaks Out On Deep State Death,24 JUN 2021,5102,"Yesterday, after news broke that John McAfee was found dead from ‘suicide’ in his prison cell, a mysterious Q drop was made. Conservative Treehouse explained: They are saying it was suicide; however, John McAfee didn’t kill himself…. no way.  For years McAfee was a romantic outlaw, rough around the edges and a little weird at times, but he also consistently said various elements of the U.S. government were out to get him. McAfee even put a tattoo on his arm saying he would not kill himself.  That is how certain he was that someone, some entity, would eventually want to shut him down. McAfee was under securities charges for making money by recommending investments without disclosing his relationship to the investment.  The charges were always a little weird, and the claims of tax evasion never amounted to enough to warrant the severity of the effort to capture him, but the U.S. was adamant about getting him extradited.  Nothing about this sniffs right.  Nothing. (Via ABC) – John McAfee, founder of McAfee Antivirus, was found dead in his cell in a Spanish jail, his lawyer confirmed to ABC News. The Spanish Interior Ministry also confirmed the death. McAfee, 75, who was a household name in computer security software, faced securities fraud charges and extradition to the U.S. at the time of his death. Between November 2017 and February 2018, McAfee leveraged his fame as a computer programmer to make more than $23 million by recommending a number of “initial coin offerings” to his Twitter followers, federal prosecutors said. The problem, according to prosecutors, was that McAfee failed to disclose he was a paid pitchman and promoting an investment product without disclosing you’re being paid to do so is unlawful. (read more) The Gateway Pundit added: John McAfee was found dead in a Spanish prison cell on Wednesday, but the letter “Q” was posted to his Instagram account hours after his death. McAfee’s wife, Janice, is believed to have posted to his accounts for him while he was imprisoned — but it is currently unclear who has access or posted the cryptic “Q.” There was no caption or explanation with the photo. The death of the 76-year-old outspoken political activist and anti-virus software pioneer is currently being reported as a suicide, however, he has frequently claimed that if he dies by suicide it was the government. Earlier in the day, Spain’s National Court approved a request for his extradition back to the US. McAfee even got a tattoo in 2019 reading “$WHACKD.” McAfee was arrested by Spanish authorities on October 3, 2020 at the El Prat Airport.He was wanted by the US government for owing millions of dollars in taxes. Zero Hedge reports that earlier this month, McAfee argued in a videolink hearing that charges against him are politically motivated, and that he would die in prison if he was returned to the US. If convicted, he was facing up to 30 years in prison. The New York Post explained: John McAfee’s wife publicly claimed that the US wanted the software tycoon to “die in prison” — just three days before he was found hanged in his cell. Janice McAfee made the damning statement Sunday in a Father’s Day post while her husband was in a Spanish jail awaiting extradition to the US to face federal tax evasion charges. “John’s honesty has often gotten him in trouble with corrupt governments and corrupt government officials because of his outspoken nature and his refusal to be extorted, intimidated or silenced,” wrote Janice, who first met McAfee while she was working as a prostitute. “Now the US authorities are determined to have John die in prison to make an example of him for speaking out against the corruption within their government agencies,” she wrote. Within three days, McAfee was found dead in a Barcelona jail, with his death Wednesday deemed a suicide and foul play ruled out by Spanish authorities. He too had earlier warned of a possible conspiracy, comparing it to ongoing rumors about late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide in his Manhattan lockup in August 2019. “Know that if I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine,” McAffee had earlier warned. His wife’s message had insisted that there was “no hope of him ever [to] have a fair trial in America because there is no longer any justice in America.” “You either play ball or get f**Ked. Those are literally the only options now,” she wrote. “Before you were innocent until proven guilty but somehow that has changed to guilty until proven innocent,” she complained. “Now anyone can level the most heinous accusations against you without any proof and having no basis in reality but in the court of public opinion, you are tried, convicted, found guilty and your life irreparably destroyed, all before having your day in court,” she said. “These eight months John has spent in prison in Spain have been especially hard on his overall health both mentally and physically, as well as financially, but he is undeterred from continuing to speak truth to power,” she insisted. She signed off, “Happy Father’s Day John David, Father of many, loved by few.”"
Fauci Slips Up! Accidentally Revealed Redacted Zuckerberg “Resources And Money” Offer,22 JUN 2021,3838,"In recent statements, fatal Dr. Fauci accidentally let slip information about Mark Zuckerberg’s nefarious activities. The National Pulse explained: Dr. Anthony Fauci has revealed what Mark Zuckerberg offered him in redacted portions of his recently released emails. The conversation, he admitted, included offers of “resources and money” from the Facebook founder who at the time same was ploughing cash into interfering in the 2020 election on behalf of Democrats. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Director divulged further information as pressure ramps up over his recently published emails and the series of stunningly poor and hypocritical political decisions he appears to have taken over the course of the pandemic. Fauci’s research, and that of his colleagues, has been repeatedly linked to Chinese Communist Party entities including the hostile nation’s military. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s activities circle the same networks, with the billionaire tech CEO recently funneling money to long-term Fauci colleague Dr. Ralph Baric. Following The National Pulse’s reporting on these matters, the Facebook-funded “fact checker” Lead Stories began to censor The National Pulse content on social media. Appearing on the “Sway” podcast published by the New York Times, Fauci revealed what was behind the redactions in his e-mails with Zuckerberg which were released through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Host Kara Swisher – who has interviewed Zuckerberg and number of times – notes to Fauci: “…thousands of your emails dating from January to June of 2020 have recently been released by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post that’s giving your critics, particularly on the right, more material to work with. Your redacting of Mark Zuckerberg have added fuel to the fire. Representatives Jim Jordan and James Comer and Senator Marsha Blackburn have alleged that you worked with Facebook to censor speech. “And you’re just laughing at me, right,” she asks while Fauci laughs before asserting, “No, no, the reason I’m laughing, Kara, because every single one of those emails can be explained in a way that is perfectly normal, perfectly innocent, and completely above board.” What does Fauci regard as being “above board,” precisely? The offer of private funding for him and his organizations, despite being a government employee. In any other world, this would be constituted as a form of a bribe towards a government official. Zuckerberg has form in this area, as The National Pulse revealed around the 2020 election. “It’s like having private interests stuffing money into the pockets of the umpire before he calls the first ball or strike,” said former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline commented upon the release of information pertaining to the private, left-wing financing of the 2020 Presidential election. Now we know that at the same time this was going on, Zuckerberg was attempting to funnel cash to Fauci. The e-mails, originally redacted, were explained by Fauci: “…I don’t know who redacted that. When people ask for my emails, I don’t look through my emails and say, “OK, I’ll give you this one and redact this.” It’s completely out of my control. So you want to know what the email was really about? Hey, big scoop. Here we go. Mark said, hey, is there anything that we can do to help out to get the messages out, the right public health messages? I have a very important medium here in Facebook. Can I help? And as a matter of fact, if you guys don’t have enough resources and money to do some of the things you want, just let us know.” Sent on March 15th, 2020, Zuckerberg’s email asks Fauci for assistance with “building a Coronavirus Information Hub” on Facebook. “I will write to or call Mark and tell him that I am interested in doing this,” Fauci informs his staff."
"How Mueller And FBI Framed Four Innocent Men, And Durham’s Role",22 JUN 2021,15534,"The FBI has become the United States gestapo, and the change has been happening for a while under the radar. TechnoFog explained: The FBI knocked and Mike Albano opened the door. It was 1983. As a member of the Massachusetts State Parole Board, Albano thought he had been doing his job when he looked into voting to commute the sentence of Peter Limone, who along with Joseph Salvati, Henry Tameleo, and Louis Greco, had been convicted for the murder of Teddy Deegan in 1965. Those convictions never sat right with Albano – he was savvy to Massachusetts and the convergence of the Mob and law enforcement. His suspicions of the convictions, and sympathy to the four men, only grew when he met with Greco, who proclaimed his innocence and said “he wanted to live one day as a free man, just one day.”1 FBI special agents John Morris and John Connolly weren’t there just say hello or to discuss the details of the case (a state case, not a federal case). There was a darker purpose: straight-up intimidation. Threats that it wouldn’t be good for Albano’s career if he voted for commutation. To Albano’s credit, he voted to commute the sentence of Limone. This particular petition for commutation (Limone filed six in total that were all rejected) was denied by Governor Michael Dukakis after the FBI and then-U.S. Attorney Bill Weld put on the pressure, alleging that Limone was guilty of the Deegan murder, had been involved in commissioning the murder of Joseph “The Animal” Barboza, and would return with seniority to Boston’s organized crime structure if he was freed. The Parole Board also voted in favor of two commutation petitions by Greco. The first was denied by Governor Michael Dukakis, the second denied by Governor Bill Weld. There was no ruling on the third commutation petition filed by Greco in 1995. He died soon after it was filed. Greco’s plea to Albano, that he live “just one day” as a free man, was never granted. To understand this case and the FBI’s efforts to intimidate Albano, you have to go back to the 1960s. J. Edgar Hoover was the FBI Director and made it a focus of his to take down La Cosa Nostra – the Italian Mob – by any means necessary. To achieve this goal the FBI used criminal informants. The Teddy Deegan Murder Teddy Deegan was murdered on the night of March 12, 1965 in Chelsea, Massachusetts, just north of Boston. His body was found in an alley behind the Lincoln National Bank. He had on gloves and a screwdriver was found near his left hand. A tool of his trade. The lieutenant who arrived at the scene described a fresh pool of blood near his left knee and blood “still oozing from the rear of his head.” In all, Deegan was shot 6 times with three different guns. The officers who recognized Deegan there lying in the alley wouldn’t have been surprised. Deegan didn’t hang around the best people and didn’t exactly behave himself. They didn’t expect Deegan’s murder, but they wouldn’t have been surprised. Arrests are made. Four men – Limone, Greco, Salvati, and Tameleo – were accused of Deegan’s murder. Peter Limone was arrested on October 27, 1967. It was his tenth wedding anniversary and it was spent in jail away from his wife, Olympia, with whom he had four young children. He was supposed to meet Olymia that evening for a meeting at their sons’ school. He never showed up. Louis Greco surrendered to the FBI in Miami, having been in Florida at the time of the murder, and was extradited to Massachusetts in 1968. He too was married and had a couple young children. He was a war hero, having served in the South Pacific in the Army during World War II. For his service he had been awarded a Purple Heart and two Bronze Stars. He returned from the war “disabled for life with a shattered ankle.” Joseph Salvati was 34 when he was arrested. Like Limone, he also had four young children. Henry Tameleo was the oldest of the four men. He was born in 1901 and had been married to his wife since 1919. The Trial and Convictions The state murder trial started on May 27, 1968. Joseph Barboza, an FBI informant, testified that Limone and Tameleo approved the “hit” on Deegan, that Salvati was there with them, and that Greco helped plan the killing. Not that Barboza was innocent – he was indicted for a misdemeanor relating to the murder and was serving time for possessing an illegal firearm. This was supposedly part of a deal the FBI gave Barboza: testify for the Massachusetts government in the murder trial and they’d let the judge know the extent and materiality of his assistance. Anthony Stathopoulos, Jr. had also been at the scene and testified Greco – or a man who looked like Greco – wanted to get him as well. Other witnesses testified to guilt-indicating conduct by the defendants. For example, it was alleged that Tameleo and Greco tried to bribe Barboza and Stathopoulos to change their testimony. The defense had an uphill battle. Their lawyers suspected that the FBI might have information or documents relating to the witnesses or Deegan’s murder. But the FBI produced nothing. The jury reached its verdict on July 31, 1968. The four men were found guilty: Greco for murder in the first degree, Limone and Tameleo for accessories before the fact, Salvati for being an accessory after the fact, and all them for conspiracy to murder Deegan and Stathopoulos. Limone, Tameleo, and Greco received the death penalty. Salvati was sentenced to life.2 The convictions were brought to the attention of Director Hoover, with the Boston office sending memos citing the Suffolk County District Attorney’s comments that the prosecution was a “direct result of FBI investigation” and witness development. The FBI agents involved in the case (and who testified in support of their witness) were recommended awards and letters of commendation. They later received large bonuses and were praised by Director Hoover. The Families The families of the four men were devastated by the news. They had been distraught since the arrests – but at least with a trial they had hope things would work out in their favor. Now hope was gone and their husbands, their fathers, were facing execution. It was hard for the wives but the children had it worse. The taunts at school that their father was a murderer. Going through cold prison gates and being frisked just to spend their birthdays with their father. An empty seat at sporting events and recitals. A boy’s nightmares of his father’s electrocution. A girl’s anxiety of missing her dad. Henry Tameleo was the oldest of the four (aged 66 at the time of imprisonment) and his health was rapidly failing. The prison board and his doctors recommended he be transferred due to his health – these requests were ignored for years. He remained in prison a “sick, lonely old man” struggling with depression. His wife died in 1979. They had been married approximately 60 years; the last 10 years spent apart. He wasn’t there to hold her hand as she passed. As bad as all of that is – and it is bad – the Greco family took it the worst. I’m not sure there are words to describe the trauma they endured. Greco and his wife Roberta had two sons (Eddie and Louis Jr.) who were 10 and 12, respectively, when their father was taken away. After Greco’s conviction, his son Eddie – at just 10 years old – contemplated suicide. In his own words, he wanted to “take a plastic bag and kill myself. . . I was putting plastic bags around my head.” The boys’ mother Roberta stopped cooking and cleaning, and took up drinking and beating the kids. Eddie would go to school hungry. One day in 1970 Eddie came home to find their mother had abandoned them. They lived with family until they were thrown out of that home. Eddie was 13 and Louis Jr. was 15 when they were put out on their own. Greco’s health suffered the same fate as his family on the outside: deterioration. While Greco (and the other two defendants put on death row) was spared execution due to the termination of the death penalty in Massachusetts, he had always been sentenced to death – it was just a matter of time. His health began failing and he was ultimately unable to do most anything without assistance. He lost control of his bowels and Salvati helped clean up after him. Greco’s right leg was amputated below the knee in 1995 de to gangrene. He died in prison on December 30, 1995. Approximately two years later his son and namesake, Louis Jr., committed suicide by drinking a can of Drano. His other son Eddie struggled with cocaine and heroin addiction. He would eventually die from a likely overdose. What the FBI knew. There were FBI secrets about these convictions for 30+ years. These secrets went all the way up to FBI Director Hoover, and were uncovered in late 2000 by then-Assistant US Attorney John Durham: that the FBI had framed four innocent men for murder. This set-up was “known to, supported by, encouraged, and facilitated by the FBI hierarchy all the way up to the FBI Director.”3 To understand the FBI conspiracy, we have to go back to the 1960s and FBI Director Hoover’s efforts to take down La Cosa Nostra- the Italian Mob – by any means necessary. Part of that task involved focusing on Raymond Patriarca, a powerful New England organized crime boss. In 1962, the FBI installed a wire in Patriarca’s Providence, New England office without a warrant. The conversations were monitored and forwarded to agents in the FBI’s Boston office. This was kept secret even within the FBI. Per Judge Gertner, “FBI reports describing conversations on the wire referred to it as if it were a human source, an informant just like any other.” The FBI also made use of informants, with whom their agents were have a secret and long-term relationship. Enter Jimmy Flemmi, a career criminal and top FBI informant. The FBI had known of Flemmi’s criminal history – and knew that Flemmi had been involved in a number of murders. Condon, one of the agents handling Flemmi, had been informed in 1964 and early 1965 that Flemmi had committed several murders. This didn’t matter to FBI Agent Dennis Condon, his Boston FBI supervisor, or even to Director Hoover. He could get close to Patriarca and other mob figures and, therefore, had potential. Jimmy Flemmi was eventually closed as an informant in the fall of 1965. His brother, Stephen Flemmi, began informing for the FBI not long after. Like Jimmy, Stephen was a career criminal, gangster, and killer. The FBI’s Knowledge of the Plot to Kill Deegan The wires and informants against Patricia were well underway by 1965. In October 1964, the FBI learned on two occasions that Jimmy Flemmi wanted to kill Deegan. Director Hoover had been updated on these developments.4 Five months later, in early March 1965, Jimmy Flemmi met with Patriarca and asked for permission to execute Deegan. A couple days later Flemmi returned with Joseph Barboza and asked for the “OK” to kill him. Flemmi thought Deegan was “an arrogant, nasty sneak and should be killed.”5 Two days prior to Deegan’s murder, on March 10, 1965, an informant advised the FBI that Raymond Patriarca, a powerful New England organized crime boss, had ordered a “hit” on Deegan. They had already completed a dry run and “a close associate of Deegan’s has agreed to set him up.” The FBI knew it was coming. Deegan was executed on March 12, 1965. This was the same day that one of his killers, Jimmy Flemmi, was assigned to be developed as an informant.6 The FBI’s Knowledge The FBI never doubted who killed Teddy Deegan. The day after the murder, an FBI informant reported that Jimmy Flemmi confessed to the killing along with Roy French, Joseph Romeo Martin, Ronnie Cassesso, and Joseph Barboza. Approximately three months later, Director Hoover was informed that Flemmi had participated in the murder. The FBI was able to put together exactly how the murder was supposed to go down. After the hit was approved by Patriarca, the men planned to kill Deegan when he and an associate (who was also to be killed) were robbing a place in Chelsea. French was to tip the killers off to the time and location. Deegan’s death had the criminal world talking. On March 13, 1965 (the day after the murder), a top FBI informant reported that Jimmy Flemmi confessed to murder along with French, Romeo, Martin, Cassesso, and Barboza. “That account would be repeated over and over with minor variations in every single document the FBI had” before Barboza started cooperating.7 Other accounts supported that theory of the Deegan murder. For example, the Chelsea police had information that the men had been seen leaving a restaurant together at approximately 9 p.m. and returning 45 minutes later.  Other informants came forward. Eleven days after Deegan’s murder, on March 23, 1965, it was reported to the FBI that Barboza admitted to the killing. The memo below shows that Director Hoover was informed that the FBI’s own informants had murdered Deegan. This information wasn’t shared with state authorities or the defense counsel of the accused. As a result, this really became a criminal conspiracy by the FBI hierarchy – all the way up to Director Hoover. Durham Starts the Bulger Review In 1995, information of Whitey Bulger’s relationship with corrupt FBI agents became public, leading to an investigation of the FBI’s Boston field office. This included a review of documents relating to Limone’s case. In late 2000, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney John Durham uncovered FBI memos from the 1960s detailing FBI misconduct in this case, providing them to the DOJ, US Attorney’s Office, the defendants and state prosecutors, and the FBI. As a result, “the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office immediately filed a motion to vacate Limone’s conviction, to grant Limone a new trial, and admit him to bail. Judge Margaret Hinkle of Suffolk Superior Court ruled that the Durham documents were material, exculpatory, and cast ‘real doubt’ on the justice of Limone’s convictions.”8 The state cases against Salvati and Limone – the only two still alive – were dropped. (Greco and Tameleo had died in prison; their cases were posthumously dropped.) Mueller Once Durham uncovered these documents, the Massachusetts Pardon Board reached out to FBI Director Mueller, asking about the FBI’s official response to the exculpatory evidence. The Boston Field Office provided a shameful response that the new evidence of an FBI set-up did not mean that the men were “innocent – it merely means that they are entitled to a new trial.” The Lawsuit and Aftermath Eventually, the surviving men and their families, along with the families of the deceased Greco and Tameleo, filed suit against the FBI. Not only did the FBI refuse to admit the truth – that these men were innocent – but the FBI also obstructed their civil rights trial. It turned out that the FBI had been hiding evidence from their own lawyers. This caused Judge Gertner to order that “this matter be brought to the personal attention of the Director of the FBI [Robert Mueller].” After a bench trial, Judge Gertner concluded this case was “about intentional misconduct, subornation of perjury, conspiracy, the framing of four innocent men.” She awarded the men and their families over $100 million in damages. For the wrongly convicted and their families, this would never be enough. Meanwhile, the FBI headquarters is still called the J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building. Mueller enjoys, at least with some, a good reputation despite his small but significant part in this saga. And Durham – now Special Counsel – still quietly looks for the truth.  "
Federal Judge Shuts Down CDC ‘Sailing Orders’ Blocking Agency From Regulating Business,22 JUN 2021,3333,"A federal judge has ruled that the CDC grossly overreached its ‘powers’ and has issues an injunction stopping the leftist controlled agency from enforcing unconstitutional regulations on sailing businesses. The Hill ‘reported’: A federal judge in Florida on Friday ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) coronavirus-era sailing orders were an overreach of power, issuing a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the CDC from enforcing the guidelines. Judge Steven Merryday for the Middle District of Florida in his ruling sided with the Sunshine State in its argument that the “CDC’s conditional sailing order and the implementing orders exceed the authority delegated to CDC.” As a result, Merryday approved Florida’s motion for a preliminary injunction suspending the mandatory guidelines for cruise ships, writing that the CDC is “preliminary enjoined from enforcing against a cruise ship arriving in, within, or departing from a port in Florida the conditional sailing order and the later measures.” The injunction will stay in place until July 18, at which point the “conditional sailing order and the measures promulgated under the conditional sailing order will persist as only a non-binding ‘consideration,’ ‘recommendation’ or ‘guideline,'” as is the case for other industries such as restaurants, railroads and hotels, according to the ruling. The cruise industry had previously been under a conditional sailing order issued by the CDC since the end of October, under which cruise lines were required to commit to a phased approach of implementing testing and other safety measures before they could start sailing. The conditional sailing order followed the end of the CDC’s no-sail order amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the CDC last month released the final guidance for cruise lines to apply to run test ships with voluntary passengers. Merryday wrote in his ruling Friday, “Never has CDC conditioned pratique as extensively and burdensomely as the conditional sailing order; and never has CDC imposed restrictions that have summarily dismissed the effectiveness of state regulation and halted for an extended time an entire multi-billion dollar industry nationwide.” “In a word, never has CDC implemented measures as extensive, disabling, and exclusive as those under review in this action,” he added. Friday’s ruling resulted from an April lawsuit filed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on behalf of the state against the CDC and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra arguing that the sailing orders and health requirements issued by the CDC for cruise lines were “arbitrary and capricious” and amounted to an unconstitutional overstepping of the agency’s authority. DeSantis, who has long railed against coronavirus safety restrictions, praised the judge’s Friday ruling, writing in a statement issued by his office, “The CDC has been wrong all along, and they knew it.” “The CDC and the Biden Administration concocted a plan to sink the cruise industry, hiding behind bureaucratic delay and lawsuits,” he continued. “Today, we are securing this victory for Florida families, for the cruise industry, and for every state that wants to preserve its rights in the face of unprecedented federal overreach.” The Hill has reached out to the CDC for comment on Friday’s ruling."
"After 13-Yr-Old Dead from Experimental Vaccine, WHO Now Changes Tune",22 JUN 2021,2043,"After many, many deaths reported in young people who were forced to get the vaccine by clueless parents, the World Health Organization has suddenly changed its recommendations… again. Conservative Treehouse reported: CTH has received anecdotal and unconfirmed reports the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine has been pulled from the market.  Three independent reports, from 3 different retail pharmacies, have highlighted instructions to send back the J&J vaccine.  If we find out more about this we will let you know ASAP. Per earlier reporting from media, there was supposed to be an emergency FDA/CDC/NIH meeting this Friday about substantial reports of vaccine side-effects.  Perhaps the J&J recall (not yet publicized) is related; unknown.  In the interim, The World Health Organization (WHO) is now recommending that children SHOULD NOT get the vaccine: {LINK} WHO – […] Children should not be vaccinated for the moment. There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults. However, children should continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines. (link)
 That’s a pretty profound change in direction from the WHO with little publicity about it.  Something seemingly sketchy appears to be going on in the background. How can colleges and schools require a COVID vaccine when the WHO is now recommending against it? Suspicious cat remains, well, suspicious… … and we note the earlier warning:  “As soon as corporate media starts giving credit for the vaccine to President Donald Trump, *THAT* is the exact moment when you will know the narrative will switch to “dangerous vaccinations”. .  Watch for it.” One mother removed her social media posts about the death of her healthy 13-year-old son, but many people wonder how many children have been killed by a vaccine they did not need to receive, supposedly to protect from a virus that was not deadly to them."
SCOTUS Rules On Upholding Obamacare And Religious Freedom For Parents,18 JUN 2021,4054,"The Supreme Court issued rulings on prominent cases this week, one for Obamacare and another concerning religious liberty. Just the News reported: The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled in favor of upholding Obamacare against the latest Republican challenge, preserving key protections for millions with preexisting health conditions. The nation’s highest court ruled against Texas and other Republican-led states in a 7-2 ruling seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, according to CNBC. The decision focused on the law’s individual mandate, requiring Americans to have insurance. The law’s challengers, made up of 18 red states, urged the court to rule that Obamacare’s requirement for nearly all Americans to obtain health insurance, known as the individual mandate, is unconstitutional. They argued for that reason the law should be scrapped, according to NBC News. Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the court’s opinion, said the states’ case did not have the legal standing to try to upend the law, dismissing it, according to The Washington Post. The Gateway Pundit explained: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Obamacare in the latest GOP challenge arguing a recent change to the individual mandate made it unconstitutional. The highest court of the land in a 7-2 vote ruled the GOP challengers, 18 red states led by Texas, did not have legal standing. Two out of three Trump appointees, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, sided with the majority. Neil Gorsuch dissented. Both Alito and Gorsuch dissented and said the court should have declared it unconstitutional. NBC News reported: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, remains valid, rejecting a claim by a group of conservative states that a recent change to the law made it unconstitutional. The law’s challengers, 18 red states led by Texas, urged the court to rule that Obamacare’s requirement for nearly all Americans to obtain health insurance or pay an income tax penalty — known as the individual mandate — is unconstitutional. For that reason, they said, the entire law must be scrapped. “The plaintiffs claim that without the penalty the act’s minimum essential coverage requirement is unconstitutional,” Breyer wrote for the court’s majority, adding, “They also argue that the minimum essential coverage requirement is not severable from the rest of the act,” meaning the entire law is invalid. “We do not reach these questions of the act’s validity, however, for Texas and the other plaintiffs in this suit lack the standing necessary to raise them,” he wrote. Conservative Treehouse reported: Philadelphia city leadership had previously changed policies forbidding foster-care referrals to faith-based worship groups.  The far-left Philadelphia government officials had expressed their ‘woke’ advocacy by blocking Catholic Social Services (CSS), an organization associated with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and foster parents from providing services due to their outlook on traditional marriage. Two foster parents and CSS sued the city for discrimination alleging the policy violated their first amendment right to their religious belief.  Two lower courts ruled against Catholic Social Services, reflecting just how politicized the local and state judiciary has become.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with CSS and the parents in a 9-0 ruling [full pdf here], affirming that Philadelphia was factually discriminating against the group based on their religious beliefs. However, as noted by SCOTUS Blog – […] “the decision fell short of the broad endorsement of religious freedom that the challengers had sought. While the justices unanimously agreed with CSS and the foster parents that the city’s action was unconstitutional, a six-justice majority left intact the Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, which held that government actions do not violate the Constitution’s free exercise clause as long as they are neutral and apply to everyone.”"
Mask Dangers Ignored After Study Finds Deadly Child Risks,18 JUN 2021,2390,"A group of Florida parents submitted children’s masks for lab analysis, and the results are terrifying, leading many people to argue even stronger for the end of this constitutional and personal abuse. Rational Ground reported: A group of parents in Gainesville, FL, sent 6 face masks to a lab at the University of Florida, requesting an analysis of contaminants found on the masks after they had been worn. The resulting report found that five masks were contaminated with bacteria, parasites, and fungi, including three with dangerous pathogenic and pneumonia-causing bacteria. Although the test is capable of detecting viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, only one virus was found on one mask (alcelaphine herpesvirus 1). The analysis detected the following 11 dangerous pathogens on the masks: Half of the masks were contaminated with one or more strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria. One-third were contaminated with one or more strains of meningitis-causing bacteria. One-third were contaminated with dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. In addition, less dangerous pathogens were identified, including pathogens that can cause fever, ulcers, acne, yeast infections, strep throat, periodontal disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and more. The face masks studied were new or freshly-laundered before wearing and had been worn for 5 to 8 hours, most during in-person schooling by children aged 6 through 11. One was worn by an adult. A t-shirt worn by one of the children to school and unworn masks were tested as controls. No pathogens were found on the controls; samples from the front top and bottom of the t-shirt found proteins that are commonly found in skin and hair, along with some commonly found in soil. A parent who participated in the study, Ms. Amanda Donoho, commented that this small sample points to a need for more research: “We need to know what we are putting on the faces of our children each day. Masks provide a warm, moist environment for bacteria to grow.” The parents contracted with the lab because they were concerned about the potential of contaminants on masks that their children were forced to wear all day at school, taking them on and off, setting them on various surfaces, wearing them in the bathroom, etc. This prompted them to send the masks to the University of Florida’s Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center for analysis."
"Secret Recording: GOP Candidate Claims Access To “Assassins,” Threatens To Put “Russian” Hit on MAGA Rival",18 JUN 2021,12580,"The ruling elite in the United States are desperate to retain their power… case in point, Juneteenth… but one RINO in Florida is so obsessed with it, he was caught in a secret recording threatening the assassination of his MAGA rival. Politico reported: MIAMI — A little-known GOP candidate in one of Florida’s most competitive congressional seats was secretly recorded threatening to send “a Russian and Ukrainian hit squad” to a fellow Republican opponent to make her “disappear.” During a 30-minute call with a conservative activist that was recorded before he became a candidate, William Braddock repeatedly warned the activist to not support GOP candidate Anna Paulina Luna in the Republican primary for a Tampa Bay-area congressional seat because he had access to assassins. The seat is being vacated by Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), who is running for governor. “I really don’t want to have to end anybody’s life for the good of the people of the United States of America,” Braddock said at one point in the conversation last week, according to the recording exclusively obtained by POLITICO. “That will break my heart. But if it needs to be done, it needs to be done. Luna is a f—ing speed bump in the road. She’s a dead squirrel you run over every day when you leave the neighborhood.” Reached by text message, Braddock refused to say whether he made any threats about Luna to the person who recorded him, Erin Olszewski. Asked repeatedly via text if he mentioned Russian-Ukrainian hit squads, Braddock wouldn’t give a yes or no answer, saying he had not heard the recording and that it’s “allegedly me … there is no proof of that.” He also suggested the recording “may even be altered and edited.” “This is a dirty political tactic that has caused a lot of people a lot of stress and is completely unnecessary,” he said. Olszewski denied editing or altering the recording. She said she made it because she was concerned about Braddock’s “unhinged” dislike of Luna that he had previously expressed. After she made the recording just after midnight last Wednesday, she promptly turned it over to St. Petersburg, Fla., police and gave a heads-up to her friend Luna, who filed a petition for an injunction against Braddock. Luna and Olszewski each received a temporary restraining order against him last week. Braddock filed to run Monday. In the recording, Braddock early in the call brought up the alleged assassins. He also made rambling statements about getting financial help from fellow Freemasons or by somehow importing millions of dollars from Malta and Gibraltar. “I have access to a hit squad, too, Ukrainians and Russians,” he said about three minutes into the call, adding “don’t get caught out in public supporting Luna. … Luna’s gonna go down and I hope it’s by herself.” Braddock went on to explain that he didn’t think Luna could win in the general election. Luna, an Air Force veteran and former model who went on to become a conservative activist, won a crowded GOP primary in the state’s 13th Congressional District last year but lost the general election to Crist. It’s unclear exactly why Braddock has such dislike toward Luna. The two do not appear to have any previous connection to one another, and Braddock is a lower-tier candidate in an increasingly crowded race for Crist’s seat. Already, two state lawmakers and a former Obama administration official have entered the race, with others expected to jump in. The threats, claims of assassins and political backstabbing put an only-in-Florida stamp on what was already shaping up to be a wild midterm of congressional races. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz in the Panhandle is still batting back accusations in an ongoing federal sex trafficking probe. Democratic Rep. Val Demings is leaving her Orlando seat to run for Senate, causing a mad scramble to replace her. And the state is getting an additional congressional seat that is certain to lead to another crush of candidates after redistricting before next year’s elections. Olszewski, who initiated and recorded the call just after midnight on June 9, said she phoned Braddock at his insistence because he kept trying to get her to appear on a health care panel for an event he was organizing. Olszewski, a nurse by training, became a conservative figure last year after penning a book called “Undercover Epicenter Nurse: How Fraud, Negligence, and Greed Led to Unnecessary Deaths at Elmhurst Hospital,” which some in the health care industry have called disinformation. After having a few conversations with Braddock, however, Olszewski said she became concerned that he wanted to use her to advance his candidacy and that he left her “threatening” messages about Luna that sounded “unhinged.” With such a closely divided Congress currently in Democratic control, Braddock said on the recorded call that the “pivotal” St. Petersburg-based district will take on outsized importance in 2022 to keep America from devolving into a “communist-socialist s—hole.” When Olszewski asked him why he had Russians at the ready, Braddock indicated they were to stop Luna. “My polling people are going to charge me $20,000 to do a poll right before the primary. And if the poll says Luna’s gonna win, she’s gonna be gone. She’s gonna disappear,” Braddock said in the recorded call, pledging Olszewski to secrecy. “For the good of our country, we have to sacrifice the few. … For the better or the good of the majority of the people, we’ve got to sacrifice the few.” Later in the call, Olszewski asked what would happen if “Luna is gonna win” and Braddock assured her that wouldn’t happen. “She’s gonna be gone. Period. That’s the end of the discussion. Luna is not an issue,” he said. Olszewski pushed him, asking “how do we make her go, though? I just don’t understand that.” “I call up my Russian and Ukrainian hit squad, and within 24 hours, they’re sending me pictures of her disappearing,” he replied. “No, I’m not joking. Like, this is beyond my control this point.” Asked if the killers were snipers, Braddock described them as, “Russian mafia. Close-battle combat, TEC-9s, MAC-10s, silencers kind of thing. No snipers. Up close and personal. So they know that the target has gone.” Olszewski said that threats like the ones Braddock made “you can’t take lightly. Normal people don’t say these things.” Olszewski called Braddock on one smartphone and recorded video of the call with another, occasionally displaying his name and number on the video to show it was him on the call. POLITICO also obtained a separate recording, a voicemail message, Braddock left with a consultant in which his phone number was identical and voice seemed to match the information Olszewski shot in her video. In Florida, it’s a third-degree felony to record another person without their knowledge. But Olszewski said that St. Petersburg police told her she had nothing to worry about in recording the conversation and turning it over to authorities. A spokesperson for the St. Petersburg police declined to comment on the recording or whether it was legally recorded. Braddock, though, indicated he was ready to sue Olszewski. “The folks in possession of whatever recording they think they have of myself or someone else (which may even be altered and edited) will be facing civil damages suit(s) when the paperwork is file [sic] with the county and felony charges after I file with the local police department,” Braddock said in his text message to POLITICO. “I strongly advise not to get involved because the civil suits will continue to be filed until people stop sharing them because whomever is on the recording did not consent to be recorded in my humble opinion.” In her filing for an injunction, Luna also mentioned how Braddock claimed in the call with Olszewski that two other potential Republican candidates in the race, Amanda Makki and Matt Tito, had formed an alliance with him to stop Luna. Braddock briefly posted the petition for the injunction on his Facebook page Friday but then took them down. Both Makki and Tito denied the claims of an alliance with Braddock and each of them criticized Luna for mentioning their names in the injunction she filed against Braddock. “The fact she dragged me through the mud, after not seeing or talking to me after 11 months, it really calls into question her judgment,” said Makki, who ran unsuccessfully in the GOP primary against Luna in 2020, despite earning the endorsement of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Tito, also, was displeased with the fact that he was named in the injunction. “This is a total political hit job. I wasn’t served. I’m not in legal trouble,” he said. “Luna doesn’t want me to get in the Republican race because she knows I’ll beat her. I’m a better candidate. She’s trying to wipe me out of the race, trying to embarrass me, intimidate me, smear my name so she has a wider path to the nomination.” In the call, Braddock mentioned that he offered Tito a job on his campaign to keep him on the sidelines, but Tito said he had no intention to work for Braddock. James Blair, a spokesperson for Luna, said she wouldn’t comment on the ongoing investigation. But he suggested Makki had “sour grapes” for losing the primary last year to Luna. And he faulted Tito because he “immediately blamed the woman” by accusing Luna of a political hit job. “The content of the protective order filed is based upon Mr. Braddock’s own threats, actions, and statements,” Blair said. “I understand that Mr. Braddock is the one who stated he is working with Mr. Tito and Ms. Makki, so perhaps they should take it up with him instead of attacking the person he said he was going to kill if that’s what it took to keep her from winning.” In her petition for the restraining order, Luna made it clear that she took Braddock’s threats seriously. “I do not feel safe and am currently in fear for my life,” Luna wrote, according to a copy of it. Olszewski, too, said Braddock sounded dangerous. At one point, Braddock even said he was scared himself. “Don’t be on the f—ing wrong side of supporting Luna because if you’re near her when the time comes, I just don’t want that to happen to you because you’ve got kids,” Braddock said on the call. “So don’t be associated with Luna under any circumstances. Please. And do not repeat this anybody because both of us will be in jeopardy if you do. I’m not just blowing smoke here. I’m f—ing being dead ass serious and it scares the s— out of me, too.” Conservative Treehouse explained: I am really interested in the opinion of this story from readers who remember the era, tactics and strategies of former GOP consultant ¹Lee Atwater. I cannot read this bizarre and unstable story without thinking about the stuff Atwater used to do…. The Tampa Bay, Florida, area congressional seat currently occupied by Charlie Crist is going to be vacant as Crist runs for Florida Governor in 2022 against republican Ron DeSantis. As a result there are many people lining up to run for the Tampa area congressional district.  One of the leading republican candidates is Paulina Luna who lost to Crist in 2020 (local election ballot fraud not withstanding). However, a story in Politico today outlines a lower-tier GOP candidate threatening to kill Paulina Luna if it looks like she will win the primary.  The entire story is beyond weird, including how and why someone would have begun recording the conversation in the first place; then the goofy story is delivered to lefty Politico exclusively (ergo very Atwater-esque).

Zuckerberg Group Funded “Gain Of Function” Researcher?,17 JUN 2021,4185,"Zuckerberg was instrumental in arranging the election rig for his ‘controllers.’ Not only does his social media platform control information, but he also paid huge amounts of money to organize and produce ballot fixes and now. The National Pulse has explained: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – the funding group behind much of the unlawful election changes of 2020 – gave nearly half a million dollars to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The university counts Wuhan lab collaborator and gain-of-function proponent Dr. Ralph Baric as a lead researcher. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Professor – who has also attended conferences at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and is described by the lab’s “bat woman” as her “longtime collaborator” – received the grant from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s philanthropic group in July 2020. “The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) recently awarded a $433,000 grant to UNC for laboratory equipment that will accelerate research to address the COVID-19 pandemic,” a press release notes. “This grant represents a new collaboration between the West Coast philanthropic organization CZI and UNC in search of a global solution to the pandemic,” a summary adds before detailing how the grant was used: The grant covers the purchase of a “liquid handler” — a robotic arm that can pipette fluids much more quickly and accurately than humans can — and supporting instruments, including another robot that detects active virus particles in samples and a machine to sequence RNA. Together, these tools increase the rate of testing compounds by 20-fold. The grant allegedly helped produce a study – currently awaiting peer review – entitled SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus, viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, and serostatus of symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients in the United States. “Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of demographic, immunologic, virologic, and clinical disease factors associated with infectious virus isolation and levels of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples in the largest study of symptomatic outpatient adults with COVID-19 to date,” the summary notes. A slide from a Baric presentation on the matter also listed support from Gilead Sciences, the National Institutes for Health, and Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Dr. Fauci recently attempted to cover-up his relationship with Zuckerberg by telling MSNBC host Chuck Todd he had “no idea” what Senator Marsha Blackburn was getting at when discussing the pair’s leaked e-mails. The Baric Lab study says it aimed to gain a “deeper understanding” of COVID-19 in order to “accurately identify and quarantine contagious individuals” “A deeper understanding of the viral and host factors associated with infectious virus detection is essential to accurately identify and quarantine contagious individuals. Several studies have reported associations between SARS-CoV-2 virus isolation and viral RNA levels or time from symptom onset. However, little is known about which host factors (i.e. demographics, comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, symptomatology etc.) are associated with infectious virus detection.” The financial ties between Baric and the Facebook-linked charity follow the social media platform heavily censoring users and stories that promoted theories that COVID-19’s origins could be traced to a Wuhan lab. Facebook contracts with the exclusively Democrat-run “Lead Stories” group, staffed mostly by CNN flunk-outs, in order to censor inconvenient information. Lead Stories is also contracted by TikTok, in turn owned by ByteDance, a firm used by the Chinese Communist Party and its People’s Liberation Army to further communist propaganda. Dr. Baric – who has defended controversial gain-of-function research as a “crucial tool” – was an early proponent of the Facebook-approved theory that COVID-19 originated through his involvement with a Lancet journal statement prematurely asserting the virus had natural origins. The CZI has come under increased scrutiny for its role in the 2020 presidential election, funneling millions into Democratic districts to turn out the vote for Joe Biden."
"Wuhan Lab With Bats?! Video Shows WHO Lied, China Lied, Everyone Involved Lied",14 JUN 2021,3357,"They lied to you about COVID 19 and are still lying. Conservative Treehouse explained: In this video investigative report Sharri Markson reveals how the Wuhan Institute of Virology kept live bats in cages with new footage from inside the facility. This footage proves the denials from World Health Organization investigators were false. The WHO previously said any suggestion the Wuhan lab was conducting SARS experiments on bats was a “conspiracy”. Additionally, all of the 15,000 bat research files were removed from the Wuhan Lab in September of 2019 right before the Pandemic exploded on the world. WATCH: Citizen Free Press added: New video shows Wuhan Lab kept live bats — More than 15,000 experimental files deleted The Wuhan Institute of Virology kept live bats in cages, new footage from inside the facility has revealed, disproving denials from W.H.O. investigators who claimed the suggestion was a “conspiracy.” An official Chinese Academy of Sciences video to mark the launch of the new biosafety level 4 laboratory in May 2017 speaks about the security precautions that are in place if “an accident” occurs and reveals there had been “intense clashes” with the French Government during the construction of the laboratory. The video shows bats being held in a cage at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, along with vision of a scientist feeding a bat with a worm. The 10 minute video is titled “The construction and research team of Wuhan P4 laboratory of Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences” and features interviews with its leading scientists. The WHO report investigating the origin of the pandemic failed to mention that any bats had been kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and only its annex referred to animals being housed there. A member of the World Health Organisation team investigating the origin of the pandemic in Wuhan, zoologist Peter Daszak said it was a conspiracy to suggest bats were held at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In one tweet dated December, 2020 he said: “No BATS were sent to Wuhan lab for genetic analysis of viruses collected in the field. That’s now how this science works. We collect bat samples, send them to the lab. We RELEASE bats where we catch them!” In another tweet, dated December 11, 2020, he said: “This is a widely circulated conspiracy theory. This piece describes work I’m the lead on and labs I’ve collaborated with for 15 years. They DO NOT have live or dead bats in them. There is no evidence anywhere that this happened. It’s an error I hope will be corrected.” This month, Daszak appeared to retract his earlier denials and admitted the Wuhan Institute of Virology may have housed bats but admitted he had not asked them. The Chinese Academy of Sciences video was discovered by researchers investigating the origin of the pandemic who call themselves DRASTIC. Digital archivist “Jesse” found the Chinese Academy of Sciences Video while the group’s co-ordinator, who goes by a pseudonym of “Billy Bostickson” for safety reasons, has long complained evidence bats were housed in the Wuhan laboratories. Mr. Daszak has not responded to requests for comment.

2018 Video Shows Wuhan Collaborator Scheming To “Make Money” Off ‘Next’ Pandemic,14 JUN 2021,2310,"In 2018, a little after Fatal Fauci explained that President Trump’s administration would face a pandemic, gain-of-function advocate Dr. Ralph Baric for Wuhan explained how to “make money” from the next pandemic. The National Pulse explained: While speaking at a conference in 2018, Wuhan Institute of Virology and collaborator and gain-of-function advocate Dr. Ralph Baric advised attendees on how to “make money” in the next pandemic. Baric – who’s attended conferences at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and is described by Wuhan’s “bat woman” Shi Zhengli as one of her “longtime collaborators” – made the comments at an April 2018 event hosted at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Baric – who’s described lifting bans on gain-of-function research as “critical” – also provided the Wuhan lab with humanized mice to likely conduct the controversial form of research with SARS-like coronaviruses. “Gain-of-function represents one of those approaches that is a crucial tool for public health preparedness and response,” Baric asserted in 2014 while lobbying against a moratorium on gain-of-function research. During his 2018 speech “Imagining the Next Flu Pandemic – and Preventing it!” he presents a slide titled “Global Catastrophe: Opportunities Exist.” The slide outlines what type of stocks and industries surged during the Ebola outbreak, which he uses to extrapolate financial advice on how to “make money in the next pandemic.” “I wanted to give you good news. There are winners out there, right? So if you ever want to be prepared and make money in the next pandemic, if that’s what you want to do, buy stock in Hazmat suit makers and protective clothing or companies that make antiviral drugs for that particular pandemic,” he notes. Baric adds that the aforementioned sectors and stocks would “probably do pretty well” before highlighting that “there are actually mutual funds for pandemic preparedness.” “Some products do well. 1918 including masks, same thing today,” he advises. While speaking over the following slide – “Pandemics: Opportunity” – Baric posits that “pandemics really are times of opportunity.” “There is an opportunity for people to have political gain, financial gain, and personal gain during times of social upheaval, and that will probably occur,” he adds.

Hunter’s Racist Email Scandal Now Includes “D*kes and F*ggots”,11 JUN 2021,8922,"Because America no longer has real journalism, only Chinese-owned propaganda, Hunter Biden’s recent email revelations are being ignored, even the newest revelation concerning the use of words like “d*kes” and “f*ggots.” The National Pulse reported: Hunter Biden’s friends appeared to mock “f*ggots” and “d*kes” in emails unearthed by the National Pulse from the president’s son’s hard drive. The June 21st, 2017 email follows The Daily Mail reporting Hunter’s repeated use of the n-word in text message conversations with his lawyer. Included in an invite to a “beach weekend getaway” in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sender William Medford discusses how “at some point we may bear witness to f*gots holding hands and dikes bumping claims.” Medford offsets the message with a disclaimer noting it “may or may not have the approval of the GLTB community.” In full, the email reads: Disclaimer: The following message is not intended to offend anyone and is for informational purposes only. It may or may not have the approval of the GLTB community. Gents, The hour is almost upon us, where we at some point may bear witness to fagots holding hands and dikes bumping claims. Anyway, just want to pass along a few details concerning this weekend. Beach House Address: [REDACTED] Beach House Landline: [REDACTED] My Cell Phone: [REDACED] For those even thinking of getting a little work done over the weekend, you will have access to high-speed wifi internet, printing capabilites and an on-site IT specialist with a 48-hour response time. Looking forward to a great weekend! -William  A separate email from Hunter sent two days before the aforementioned email reveals that the president’s son intended on attending the event, noting “I am actually excited to be with you all now.” In full, the email reads: Hey Ashley, I know I’m a little late in responding to this email BUT I was scrolling back through these emails for just such a gem as this. Did you just refer to yourself in the third person as ASHMAN? I want to be certain I didn’t misread the email, but if I didn’t I just want to warn you that I am going to start a campaign to tease you mercilessly as only Beau could all weekend long. You may cry at one point t and hold you as we stroll the boardwalk of “Reho.” What the fuck is Reho? Just fair warning. I am actually excited to be with you all now. Thanks Assman. Love you, The Hunkmeister—— The latest revelations come as the corporate media establishment refuse to cover the Hunter Biden messages that show the President’s son repeatedly using the n-word. In his zero-selling book, Hunter Biden elaborates upon how he went on drug-fueled escapades around Washington, D.C. while making money off his family name. He admits in the book that he would not have been offered the positions and contracts he was, had he not been a Biden. The Daily Mail originally reported: EXCLUSIVE: Hunter Biden addressed his white lawyer as ‘n***a’ multiple times, used phrases like ‘true dat n***a’ and bantered ‘I only love you because you’re black,’ in shocking texts unearthed days after Joe’s emotional Tulsa speech decrying racism Hunter Biden used the n-word multiple times in conversation with his white, $845-per-hour lawyer, his texts messages reveal. The shocking texts may prove embarrassing for his father President Joe Biden, who just last week gave a speech decrying racism on the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, and has sought to portray racial justice as a top priority for his administration. The president’s son joked in a January 2019 text to corporate attorney George Mesires about a ‘big penis’, and said to the lawyer: ‘I only love you because you’re black’ and ‘true dat n***a’. In another text a month earlier he wrote to the Chicago lawyer saying: ‘how much money do I owe you. Becaause (sic) n***a you better not be charging me Hennessy rates.’ Mesires replied: ‘That made me snarf my coffee.’ Hunter added: ‘That’s what im saying ni…’, cutting off the racial slur mid-word, then texted a picture to Mesires. The picture was not downloaded on Hunter’s laptop, from which the text exchange was recovered by DailyMail.com. But Mesires replied: ‘Why are you so tan?’ ‘I’m sorry for sexting you accidentally that was meant for another friend named Georgia,’ Hunter replied. In the January text exchange, the two men were talking about philosophy and bantering with each other. Mesires: ‘There are ideals of unconditional love that serve as proxies. I don’t have many. You. God,’ Hunter: ‘OMG n***a did you just a fictional character from the imagination of the collective frightened and my dead brothers unconditional love is what I should rely on and my kids aren’t children George.’ Mesires: ‘My parents love was conditioned.’ Hunter: ‘My penis as of late has been un conditional.’ Mesires: ‘That’s why we are searching.’ Hunter: ‘For my penis.’ Mesires: ‘And we will always be searching.’ Hunter: ‘Its big penis George. They always find it. And I only love you because you’re black.’ Mesires: ‘It’s so annoying when you interject with frivolity.’ Hunter: ‘True dat n***a. But I’m done my rant.’ In October 2018 Mesires sent a bill to Hunter’s business partner Mervyn Yan, involved in his infamous deal with Chinese oil giant CEFC, showing the attorney’s hourly rate of $845. The bill, which included ‘teleconferences with H. Biden regarding Hudson West’, Hunter’s joint venture with the Chinese, totaled $88,465, for 107 hours work from August 2017 to April 2018. Among the photos stored on Hunter’s laptop was a meme which also included the n-word. The meme, dated June 5, 2017, included a photo of Joe Biden hugging Barack Obama with a caption describing a joke conversation between the former president and vice president. ‘Obama: Gonna miss you, man ‘Joe: Can I say it? Just this once? ‘Obama: *sigh* go ahead ‘Joe: You my n***a, Barack’ It is unclear why Hunter saved the meme on his computer. Neither he nor Mesires responded to DailyMail.com’s request for comment. The president’s son and the White House have repeatedly failed to respond to any requests from DailyMail.com about any of the material on his laptop. The 51-year-old’s computer had a week of his internet browsing history from March 2019 saved on it before he abandoned it at a Delaware shop, which showed pornographic photos and videos downloaded on his laptop included an orgy between a woman and several black men. Hunter’s father has attempted to make race a central issue in both his presidential campaign – which came amid nationwide protests over racism and police brutality in 2020 – and in his administration. In a speech last week on the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa massacre in which a white mob killed an estimated 300 black people in Oklahoma, Joe Biden said he had come to ‘fill the silence’. ‘Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try,’ he said. ‘Only with truth can come healing.’ Biden pledged to help fight racism in policing following George Floyd’s death, and has even backed studies exploring reparations for slavery and other injustices against African Americans. The president picked the US’s first black vice president, and was himself VP to the first black president. In an interview on NBC’s Today show in April, the president said he did not believe that the country was racist. ‘I don’t think America is racist,’ he said. ‘but I think the overhang from all of the Jim Crow—and before that, slavery—have had a cost. ‘After 400 years African Americans have been left in a position where they’re so far behind the eight ball in terms of education, health—in terms of opportunity. ‘We have to deal with it.’ Biden was previously the subject of a smear attempt that claimed he had used the n-word as a racial epithet. The smear used a video of a 1985 Senate hearing in which Biden says ‘We already have a n****r mayor, we don’t need any more n****r big shots!’ The then-senator did utter the words, but was in fact quoting a Louisiana lawmaker, asking then-deputy attorney general nominee William Bradford Reynolds why he had ignored the racist comments by the lawmaker and allowed gerrymandering that underrepresented black residents. However, some attitudes towards uttering the n-word even in quotes have turned since the 1985 hearing. In October 2020, a first-year student at Rutgers Law School in Newark used the word while quoting from a 1993 legal opinion in class, warning her fellow students beforehand that the quote contained the slur. The student said: ‘He said, um – and I’ll use a racial word, but it’s a quote. He says, ‘I’m going to go to Trenton and come back with my n*****s”.’ A race row erupted last month when her fellow students circulated a petition demanding she and professor apologize. The New York Times reported that University staff discussed barring the word’s use in class in a meeting following the row."
"Biden Regime Won’t Require Gov. Employee Vaccinations, Even Asking Is Off Limits",10 JUN 2021,3518,"Apparently, it’s okay for private businesses to force experimental vaccines on employees, but the government won’t… they won’t even ask. Conservative Treehouse explained: Considering how vested they are in pushing vaccines, this federal guidance today reflects a strong likelihood the politics and legality do not support mandating vaccines for employees.  It will be very interesting to see how the lawsuits against private businesses that are requiring vaccinations are settled in the courts. This is a very interesting development and it will also be interesting to see how the media react to government employees not being forced to vaccinate; as the leftist media have, in the aggregate, been defending all businesses that have required vaccines. Federal Guidance released today shows the federal agencies are advised not to require vaccination status, nor inquire about vaccination status, for federal employees [LINK]: Q: Should agencies require employees to be vaccinated or inquire regarding their vaccination status? A: The Administration strongly encourages all Americans, including Federal employees and contractors, to be vaccinated. Employees should receive paid time off to be vaccinated and to deal with any side effects. At present, COVID-19 vaccination should generally not be a pre-condition for employees or contractors at executive departments and agencies (agencies) to work in-person in Federal buildings, on Federal lands, and in other settings as required by their job duties. Federal employees and contractors may voluntarily share information about their vaccination status, but agencies should not require federal employees or contractors to disclose such information. Responding to agency inquiries should be voluntary, and agencies should comply with any applicable laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, and any applicable collective bargaining obligations. When an employee or contractor voluntarily discloses that they are unvaccinated or declines to provide vaccination information, agencies should use that information to implement CDC-recommended mitigation measures, including masking and physical distancing.

"Fauci Murderer! HCQ Actions Deliberately Killed Hundreds Of Thousands, New Study Shows Vax “No Benefit”",10 JUN 2021,6237,"Many people are arguing that Anthony Fauci should be arrested for crimes against humanity, specifically murder. The Gateway Pundit explained: Collateral Damage. That’s the new definition for the US Coronavirus deaths. The Gateway Pundit has reported extensively this past year on the effects of hydroxychloroquine in treating the COVID-19 virus. We knew and reported that Dr. Tony Fauci and the medical elites conspired to ban the use of this very successful drug. We reported earlier on how Dr. Fauci used bogus studies to disqualify HCQ in treating coronavirus. We also reported that there is proof that Dr. Fauci and top US medical experts all conspired using obviously false information to disqualify hydroxychloroquine and MILLIONS DIED as a result of their action. A new study released this June revealed at medRxiv suggests that the use of weight-adjusted Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZM) appears to be associated with a more than 100% increase in survival, without a clear correlation with ECG abnormalities. President Trump called this out back in March 2020. Trump actually promoted the HCQ and AZM combination one year ago! But Dr. Fauci, the media, the far left tech giants, and Democrats mocked him and disputed this treatment.
They blocked, censored and ridiculed anyone who promoted this successful treatment. They blocked, censored and banned Gateway Pundit reports on this successful treatment. And hundreds of thousands of Americans died.
Collateral damage. And now, a new study has determined that there’s no need for the dna-altering vaccine. Conservative Treehouse explained: As many people suspected, there is now a study from the Cleveland Clinic [SEE HERE] showing there is no need to vaccinate anyone who previously recovered from the COVID-19 virus.  The vaccination provides no additional benefit. CLEVELAND CLINIC – ♦ Conclusions – Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before. ♦ Summary – Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined among 52238 employees in an American healthcare system. COVID-19 did not occur in anyone over the five months of the study among 2579 individuals previously infected with COVID-19, including 1359 who did not take the vaccine. (details) The Study Found: ABSTRACT
Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods Employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next five months, among previously infected subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Results Among the 52238 included employees, 1359 (53%) of 2579 previously infected subjects remained unvaccinated, compared with 22777 (41%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained almost zero among previously infected unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, compared with a steady increase in cumulative incidence among previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, after adjusting for the phase of the epidemic, vaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not previously infected (HR 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR 0.313, 95% CI 0 to Infinity). Conclusions Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before. Summary Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined among 52238 employees in an American healthcare system. COVID-19 did not occur in anyone over the five months of the study among 2579 individuals previously infected with COVID-19, including 1359 who did not take the vaccine. Competing Interest Statement

"Worse Than We Thought! Fauci Warned EU Of Wuhan Leak, Told US Opposite As Hydroxychloroquine Deliberately Blocked",7 JUN 2021,8257,"Dr. Anthony Fauci (who has a history of pushing vaccines that actually kill people See: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/whitewashing-aids-history_b_4762295 and https://followerofthewayforever.wordpress.com/2021/02/26/black-people-fauci-knew-azt-hiv-aids-medication-was-deadly-consider-that-before-you-take-covid19-vaccines/ ) is now pushing another vaccine…. Which He knew wasn’t even necessary. It still isn’t necessary because hydroxychloroquine cures COVID. Gateway Pundit explained: The Gateway Pundit has reported extensively this past year on the effects of hydroxychloroquine in treating the COVID-19 virus. We knew that Dr. Tony Fauci and the medical elites conspired to ban the use of this very successful drug. We reported earlier on how Dr. Fauci used bogus studies to disqualify HCQ in treating coronavirus. Now this…  There is proof that Dr. Fauci and top US medical experts all conspired using obviously false information to disqualify hydroxychloroquine and MILLIONS DIED as a result of their action. As previously reported– It’s been over a year since the WHO declared the coronavirus a pandemic after originally downplaying the threat.  It is no secret that both the disease and the response to combat it following this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in late 2019 have turned our world upside-down.  Mandates, lockdowns, and guidelines seem to change every time Dr. Fauci opens his mouth.   All of these unprecedented rules were put into place, we were told, to slow down the spread of a disease that today is linked to the death of over half a million Americans and 3.7 million global citizens in the last year. You would think that researchers would have concentrated on prophylactic and therapeutic solutions of this disease especially since this disease is a death sentence for the elderly, the obese, those with preexisting conditions.  The coronavirus doctors have forced children to avoid school, mask up, and get vaccinated.  One would think that after all this time there would be a consensus in the hospitals, in the nursing homes, and in other treatment centers on how to treat a Covid positive patient or resident.  This is not the case. There still is no agreed-upon treatment plan for elderly patients who catch coronavirus to assist in their recovery. The CDC and Dr. Fauci ignored treatment plans for coronavirus patients unless the person was under severe distress. Cardiologist and Professor of Medicine Peter McCullough testified in Texas earlier this year. Dr. McCullough sees COVID patients and says 85% of COVID patients given multi-drug treatment plan recover from the disease with complete immunity. McCullough added, “The pandemic could have been over by now, he says, if those who tested positive for covid had been immediately treated before they fell ill enough to be hospitalized. He also says that thousands could have been, and still could be saved if the treatment protocol he and other physicians use were not suppressed.” Dr. Fauci and the CDC and WHO suppressed this effective treatment plan and others. And hundreds of thousands of innocents died. And now this…
The c19hcq.com website tracks all of the international studies on hydroxychloroquine and its effects on the coronavirus. There is now a new study and the results are SHOCKING!
— HCQ for COVID-19: real-time meta analysis of 245 studies HCQ is not effective when used very late with high dosages over a long period (RECOVERY/SOLIDARITY), effectiveness improves with earlier usage and improved dosing. But early treatment consistently shows positive effects.  That’s the science. TGP contributor Larry Johnson touched on this on Wednesday night and took excerpts from Headline USA‘s reports on Dr. Fauci’s emails regarding hydroxychloroquine. But the e-mails also showed that Fauci was more in the loop than he let on concerning some of the Trump administration’s proposed treatment solutions. He notoriously second-guessed then-President Donald Trump during a press conference statement about the benefits of using hydroxychloroquine. Fauci refuted President Trump in a White House press conference on March 25. Although Fauci seemed taken aback and insisted that the “anecdotal” claims had yet to be conclusively studied, a month earlier he had been looped into an email to Pence on Feb. 29 in which a pair of Oklahoma physicians extensively discussed their research on it. Fauci also responded to a Feb. 24 inquiry that noted that China had been reporting about its clinical studies with the drug. “Is there any indication/data to substantiate this claim from China (attached publication) that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease?” wrote Maryland pharmacologist Philip Gatti. Fauci’s passive reply echoed what he would later convey on the national stage. “There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim,” he wrote dismissively. “There are a lot of these types of claims going around,” he continued. “I would love to see their data.” Then in May Dr. Fauci told CNN that hydroxychloroquine was actually “dangerous” and ineffective. Dr. Fauci told CNN hydroxychloroquine was actually dangerous when used as a prophylactic against coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine had been used safely for 65 years in millions of patients. And so the message was crafted that the drug is safe for its other uses, but dangerous when used for Covid-19. This statement made headlines throughout the fake new media and it was a complete lie. After Fauci’s statements on hydroxychloroquine, the tech giants began censoring any mention of the drug. The media mocked President Trump and anyone who suggested the drug was safe and effective. Doctors treating coronavirus patients were suspended from their social media accounts. And hundreds of thousands of people died. It was all based on a lie perpetrated by Dr. Anthony Fauci. * * * * * * * * * * Now there is more information that it was not just Fauci but all of the top US medical leaders who were in on the hydroxychloroquine lie. Dr. Meryl Nass, MD, broke this story in The Defender. According to Dr. Nass, the top health officials were all in on the conspiracy against hydroxychloroquine. Fauci runs the NIAID, Collins is the NIH director (nominally Fauci’s boss) and Farrar is director of the Wellcome Trust. Farrar also signed the Lancet letter. And he is chair of the WHO’s R&D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group, which put him in the driver’s seat of the WHO’s Solidarity trial, in which 1,000 unwitting subjects were overdosed with hydroxychloroquine in order to sink the use of that drug for COVID. Farrar had worked in Vietnam, where there was lots of malaria, and he had also been involved with SARS-1 there. He additionally was central in setting up the UK Recovery trial, where 1,600 subjects were overdosed with hydroxychloroquine. Even if Farrar didn’t have some idea of the proper dose of chloroquine drugs from his experience in Vietnam, he, Fauci and Collins would have learned about such overdoses after Brazil told the world about how they mistakenly overdosed patients in a trial of chloroquine for COVID. The revelation was made in an article published in the JAMA in mid-April 2020. Thirty-nine percent of the subjects in Brazil who were given high doses of chloroquine died, average age 50. Yet the Solidarity and Recovery hydroxychloroquine trials continued into June, stopping only after their extreme doses were exposed. Fauci made sure to control the treatment guidelines for COVID that came out of the NIAID, advising against both chloroquine drugs and ivermectin. Fauci’s NIAID also cancelled the first large-scale trial of hydroxychloroquine treatment in early disease, after only 20 of the expected 2,000 subjects were enrolled. What does all this mean? Read the rest here. This is an absolutely huge development! The same people responsible for the virus were responsible for eliminating valid treatment alternatives for the same virus. We are now looking at Mass Murder on an unfathomable scale! We now have reports that in Spring 2020, Dr Fauci privately warned Europe that Covid leaked from the Wuhan lab while he publicly told the American people the opposite — AntifaBook.com (@JackPosobiec) June 7, 2021"
"President Trump Unloads On China Virus, Fauci Treason: Make Them Pay",4 JUN 2021,2209,"President Trump issued a blistering call against China, demanding the communist regime pay $10 trillion for the deaths caused by the Wuhan virus they deliberately created (thanks to help from Anthony Fauci) and released on the world. The Gateway Pundit reported: President Donald Trump has issued a statement calling for China to have to pay America “ten trillion dollars” in reparations for the death and destruction caused by COVID-19. In a statement issued on June 3, Trump wrote that “the correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore.” “Now everyone, even the so-called ‘enemy,’ are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the China virus coming from the Wuhan Lab. The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore,” the statement began. “China should pay Ten Trillion Dollars to America, and the World, for the death and destruction they have caused!” The New York Post reported on Thursday that “Dr. Anthony Fauci rushed to China’s defense in two separate interviews — claiming the theory that COVID-19 leaked from a Wuhan laboratory is ‘far out’ and that Americans should refrain from ‘pointing fingers’ at the Chinese Communist Party, despite earlier claims he was keeping an ‘open mind’ about the virus’ origin.” “The idea, I think, is quite far-fetched that the Chinese deliberately engineered something so that they could kill themselves, as well as other people. I think that’s a bit far out,” he said. Thousands of Fauci’s emails were made public this week through a Freedom of Information Act request, which revealed how he was warned that COVID may have been engineered. The Post reports: In one of the emails, the president of the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance wrote to Fauci in April 2020 to thank him for voicing support of the theory that the coronavirus began naturally rather than escaping from the Wuhan lab. EcoHealth Alliance had funneled millions of dollars in federal grant money to the Wuhan lab.

Fauci’s Boss Just Proved Massive Lie: Taxpayers Paid Wuhan And “We Had No Control”,4 JUN 2021,3060,"Anthony Fauci lied under oath, so where are the teams of Stasi-agents (aka FBI), raiding his home in the wee hours of the morning while a CNN crew happens to be there? The NIH Director just confirmed that taxpayer money was funding the Wuhan lab (Something the CDP reported waaaaaaaay back in June of 2020). The National Pulse explained: Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institute for Health (NIH), appears to have directly contradicted his underling Dr. Anthony Fauci in a bombshell moment from an interview with Hugh Hewitt yesterday. The revelations further implicate those who approved U.S. grants to the lab, and the EcoHealth Alliance run by the British-born Peter Dazcak – who The National Pulse first reported on back in February. Speaking to the veteran radio host, Dr. Collins admitted about U.S. collaboration with the Wuhan lab: Well, we, when we give a grant, Hugh, it has terms attached to it of what it is that the grantee is supposed to be doing with those funds. And we require annual reports to see whether that in fact is what they have been doing. And we trust the grantee to be honest and not deceptive. The grant funds that went to Wuhan, which were a subcontract from Eco Health, were very specifically aimed to try to categorize viruses that they could isolate from bats in Chinese caves, which we had a good reason to want to know more about, given SARS and MERS that had come out of there. And so we basically had those criteria attached to the grant. And of course, the amount of money that we were providing to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, I’m sure, was a tiny fraction of their total funding. And we had no control over what else they were doing with those funds. That’s another thing we’d like to know more about, and an investigation might potentially tell us. Collins goes on to admit that the Chinese Communist Party is, in fact, involved in the Wuhan lab, but attempts to play down their influence. In truth – as The National Pulse has revealed – the lab hosts communist study sessions in order to boost “party spirit” and fealty to the Chinese Communist Party. When asked if the NIH would collaborate with other human rights abusers and tyrannies such as North Korea, Dr. Collins replied, “Probably not,” before adding: I think you’re demonizing the Wuhan Institute of Virology as it is pure and simple an instrument of the Chinese Communist Party. There are certainly connections there, but let’s be clear. There are scientists working in that institute who are amongst the best in the world in terms of understanding virology. And many of those folks have had long-term relationships with others in other countries, including the United States, with a lot of respect, a lot of shared information. I don’t think we should just basically say well, because they’re in that country, they’re evil. I think you’re going too far with that one. The stunning news contravenes the claims by Dr. Anthony Fauci, that the NIH/NIAID that the U.S. had not collaborated with the Wuhan lab on gain-of-function research."
Secession Crisis Coming: How Democrats Today Are Exactly Mirroring Those of 1850’s,3 JUN 2021,12895,"This list of charges outlines the democrat destruction of America plan. AM Greatness wrote: It was appropriate that news of the Democrats’ plans to pack the Supreme Court broke in April, just a couple days after the 160th anniversary of the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the shots that began the Civil War. Unlike President James Buchanan, who dithered in responding to obvious Confederate aggression, the newly inaugurated Abraham Lincoln acted decisively upon taking office. He informed South Carolina Governor Francis Pickens that he would be resupplying the fort, forcing South Carolina’s hand. Lincoln’s actions did not start the war—they made it clear that war was already underway. From that point on, Americans, even those who had previously wished to ignore what was staring them in the face, were awakened to the reality of their situation. The dispute between Lincoln and Pickens that led to the attack on Fort Sumter was not simply a political struggle over who should control the regime but a larger political struggle over which regime it would be. Ultimately, it was a question of whether we would be a nation for free citizens or one that held men and women in bondage. Today’s Republicans, like Lincoln, find themselves in a regime-level conflict with the Democrats. The Democrats are firing again and again on our Constitutional order, our history, and our traditions—our metaphorical Fort Sumter, if you will—but unlike our forebear Lincoln, our elected leadership seems either to be aiding the insurgent Left or, at best, feebly invoking constitutional provisions and principles, as if our opponents have shown that their behavior can be in any way constrained by these things. We need to channel the spirit of Lincoln rather than Buchanan to win this struggle. This does not mean we should forgo our work within the current system, but we must acknowledge that whether we wish it to or not, the regime as constituted may not long endure in its current form, and we must prepare ourselves accordingly. The Indictment The Democrats have already seceded from America’s historic conception of nationhood in many respects: THEY have attacked, on a relentless and increasingly hysterical basis, white Americans, who as the overwhelming majority population, were the primary developers of America’s cultural, intellectual, and political heritage, with all its successes as well as its shortcomings. In doing so, they attack the traditions, history, and values developed by those generations of Americans that historically bound together Americans of all races, religions, and backgrounds. THEY have occupied our nation’s capital with thousands of troops as if the American people were a foreign foe. This was done in response to a nonexistent threat on the pretext of a shocking but solitary riot, wherein everyone who died was a Trump supporter and none of the so-called “insurgents” was armed. They have since held many of those participating, even peripherally, in prison for months, often in solitary confinement, on absurdly inflated charges, as a political punishment and a warning to future dissidents. THEY have engaged in bureaucratic and judicial nullification of our laws, particularly on immigration—perhaps the most important element in determining who makes up the American polity. Donald Trump ran on the platform of toughening up immigration policy. It was his defining issue. Yet the Left made a mockery of the rule of law, using the bureaucracy to throw up procedural roadblock after procedural roadblock to Trump’s agenda, while left-wing judges issued blatantly absurd rulings using invented doctrines to block Trump’s rescission of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order and accuse the administration of a “Muslim ban” that, in fact, was based heavily on an earlier Obama Administration effort. THEY have campaigned for decades to neuter the Second Amendment and disarm Americans, based on a misreading of constitutional rights and an empirically unjustified paranoia about white men and guns, pushed relentlessly in their corporate media. Terrified of urban violence, but unable to acknowledge this because of their own political taboos, affluent white leftists have sought to train their rhetorical and legal fire on groups with relatively low rates of crime, pushing ineffective policies that do not keep us safe but do keep us under their control. THEY have attacked us through their Big Tech proxies, damaging our ability to speak freely in the new public square, coordinate political action, or share information with each other outside of a tightly-controlled corporate media apparatus. This censorship campaign started with popular but more politically marginalized figures such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos and moved, boiling the frog slowly, to deplatforming the sitting president of the United States. Thousands of right-wing dissidents, many with large followings, have been effectively removed from public discourse for political reasons, often with only the flimsiest proceduralist justifications. When Project Veritas conducted devastating undercover exposes on the misbehavior of quasi-state corporate media, in which key figures from these entities actually directly admitted they are engaged in propaganda, the group was banned from social media. THEY have pursued race-based reparations/wealth confiscation from one set of Americans to another based purely on skin color in blatant contradiction of the Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the laws. Many of our existing welfare systems are, on a net basis, race-based wealth transfers. But to racialize such transfers explicitly represents a dramatic escalation in the Democrats’ war on the equality guaranteed to us in our founding documents. THEY have turned the media into a propaganda arm of the ruling political party, using their media proxies to engage in a full-time war against Trump’s policies and any policy they oppose. Journalists have abandoned all pretenses of fairness and balance. During the election campaign, they censored or refused to report on stories, such as Hunter Biden’s possible involvement with his father in corrupt dealings with the Chinese government, that would negatively affect Democrats. This was done in conjunction with the coordinated demonization of the opposition candidate. THEY have used instruments of the state such as the IRS (under Lois Lerner) the FBI (Russiagate) and the Department of Defense (attacking Tucker Carlson) and numerous other agencies to attack political opponents. Political allies of President Trump were investigated and prosecuted by the government in ways that were transparently focused on taking down the duly elected president. THEY have blatantly rigged the election process—changing of rules in violation of state law, manipulating debate rules and polls, and relentlessly pushing for an unconstitutional federalization of state election laws. THEY have engaged in asymmetric street violence against us. For the Left, their violence is speech, and our speech is violence. One-third of “very liberal” whites believe violence can be justified in pursuing political goals, vs. just 4 percent of “very conservative” whites. They have enabled their armed and violent wings to cause billions of dollars of damage during the George Floyd and Antifa riots, making them the most expensive civil disturbances in history, while criminalizing the much smaller and far less significant street forces on the Right such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, further using their control of the state legal apparatus to label their opponents as “domestic terrorists.” THEY have removed entire groups of Americans who are not in their privileged demographics from roles in government leadership. Biden tweets about a cabinet that looks like America, when his cabinet of 25 has no whites of Protestant origin, a group that encompassed almost every one of the founding fathers and even today makes up about 40 percent of the electorate. Meanwhile, in the civil service, the Democrats are taking pains to out Trump supporters and ban them from government jobs. Even the military is now falling under their assault. THEY have erased our history—tearing down our statues, renaming our schools, and revising our curricula to focus on a radical and racist doctrine of critical race theory. THEY have corrupted our jury system—with Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Joe Biden flagrantly involving themselves in a local jury trial. The specter of mob violence hung over the Derrick Chauvin trial, as was clearly evident from the juror who spoke on the record, while other jurors blatantly broke their oaths of impartiality to obtain the required verdict. THEY have locked us in our homes on the basis of often-arbitrary requirements and lack of evidence and enriched themselves dramatically in the process. Meanwhile, the most stringent lockdown proponents from Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan to Gavin Newsom in California have been found flagrantly violating their own lockdown orders. Furthermore, thousands of left-aligned “public health” professionals, many of them directly on the government payroll, advocated for the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests and riots, during the heart of the pandemic, claiming that racism was a public health crisis. THEY have attempted, most importantly, to change our fundamental structures of governance. In trying to add Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. (which is specifically excluded from statehood in the Constitution) as states, they have attempted to fundamentally and unilaterally alter the congressional balance of power. They have attempted to end the Senate filibuster (a 183-year-old tradition of our governance) and pack the Supreme Court, by amending the 152-year-old Judiciary Act in a blatant attempt to remove the influence of the last branch of government they don’t control. That they have not yet been able to accomplish all of these desecrations is due only to a couple of “moderate” Democrats remaining in the Senate. But the Right cannot stake America’s future on the continued benevolence of a couple of Democratic politicians. There is no doubt that with a few additional seats in Congress, the Democrats would not hesitate to change these laws, further cementing their secession from our mutual polity. And So? While we should not abandon our attempts to make positive change in the current system, we cannot rely solely on proceduralist maneuvers to attempt reconciliation with people who make it clear they want to defeat and destroy us. We must begin to relocate physically to welcoming local geographies and rebuild our capacity for independent action by creating parallel institutions to the existing corrupted ones. My Claremont Institute colleague Michael Anton has suggested some ways in which fundamental internal political reorganization of our states and localities could head off a dire crisis. We must aggressively challenge executive orders and unconstitutional laws within the boundaries of states we will control and begin to selectively sidestep enforcement of draconian federal laws that are odious to our values, the plain language of the Constitution, and to the concept of American liberties. There are, of course, good people on the other side of the aisle, including, for many of us, family and friends. But it is a time for choosing. Those good people remaining on the Left must decide to which type of polity they aspire. If they wish to urge their leaders to turn dramatically from their current course and reconcile with us, we should meet them in a spirit of compromise. But, if they wish to cast their lots with our current overlords and their increasingly totalitarian designs, we must tell them that while they are welcome to govern themselves they are no longer allowed to govern us. It will be overwhelming to oppose an enemy that controls virtually every single institution of society. There are indeed insurrectionists in Washington, D.C., the problem is that they are currently running the country and the bureaucracy, having imprisoned a few sad-sack political opponents who did not understand the rules of the game being played. The growing and energetic majority of Democratic leaders have already seceded from America—from its culture, its history, its government and its institutions. Lincoln lost Fort Sumter, but he, and America, eventually would triumph in the broader struggle. In 1861, America’s opponents made it clear and they viewed the war as existential. Lincoln responded with firmness and determination, a determination that would eventually lead to victory. In 2021, the Democrats have made clear that they see their struggle against us as an existential one, and that there is no tactic they will not use in search of total victory. We need to match their resolve with our own."
"Fauci + China CDC: “We’ll Get Through This Together” Email Dump Shows Gain of Function, Mask, Origin Lies",2 JUN 2021,7598,"Anyone who thinks COVID 19 was an accident is obviously not paying attention. Last year, CDP reported on the “gain of function” studies funded by U.S. taxpayers by Dr. Fauci, for the Wuhan lab. And now, nearly 13 months later, there’s an email dump proving the Chinese connection with Fauci. But, don’t worry about Fauci, he’ll continue to operate behind the scenes, orchestrating the next outbreak (bird flu?). The Gateway Pundit reported: And here it is. The Fauci emails are coming in hot. The Washington Post obtained 866 pages of Fauci emails via the Freedom of Information Act. The emails are from February, March and April 2020. Fauci told The Post that he was getting about 1,000 emails a day from strangers, politicians and medical workers. In an email dated February of 2020, Dr. Fauci is advising a woman not to wear a face mask because they don’t protect against the virus. “Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection. The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through material. It might, however, provide some slight benefit in keep out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you,” Fauci wrote. “I do not recommend that you wear a mask, particularly since you are going to a very low risk location. Your instincts are correct, money is best spent on medical countermeasures such as diagnostics and vaccines.” Recall, Fauci flip-flopped on mask-wearing several times throughout the pandemic. On March, 8 2020 — Dr. Anthony Fauci advised healthy Americans against wearing face masks. In April 2020 — The CDC said Americans should be wearing face masks for the COVID. In May 2020 — Dr. Anthony Fauci and the New England Journal of Medicine have admitted that masks are little more than symbols. Virtue signaling. On January 25, 2021 — Dr. Fauci told healthy Americans to wear two masks instead of one. And then one week later… On January 31, 2021 —Dr. Fauci backtracked on that insane idea of wearing multiple masks. The Gateway Pundit added: For over a year now The Gateway Pundit has been reporting evidence that the COVID-19 Virus originated in a Wuhan, China laboratory. Our first report was back on April 9, 2020 when we confirmed Dr. Shi Zhengli ran the coronavirus program at the Wuhan lab AFTER her program was shut down in the US due to a prior leak that killed a researcher! As early as 2018 US State Department officials warned about safety risks at the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab on scientists conducting risky tests with the bat coronavirus. US officials made several trips to the Wuhan laboratory. This is unbelievable! The deadly China coronavirus that started in China sometime in late 2019 has now circled the globe.  Evidence suggests that the coronavirus didn’t come naturally.  We still don’t know whether the deadly virus was leaked intentionally or if it was an accident. But a video has surfaced from December 2019 of WHO official Peter Daszak admitting to coronavirus manipulation at the Wuhan Lab before the pandemic was announced. The video interview was originally filmed on December 9, 2019.  A copy was posted in May 2020. The video was recorded at the Nipah Virus international conference in Singapore on December 9 and 10, 2019. At the 29:52 mark of the video, the WHO official says, “coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily… the spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.” This was an explosive development. Summit News reported: Dr Fauci’s emails have been released via a Freedom of Information Act request, and there is some pretty interesting stuff in them, particularly one email where a researcher who funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology thanks Fauci for publicly dismissing the lab leak theory early on during the pandemic. The email from Dr. Peter Daszak, President of the EcoHealth Alliance, a group that has extensive ties to the Wuhan lab gain of function research, sent an email to Fauci on April 18, 2020, roughly six weeks after the outbreak had taken hold. The email states: “As the Pl of the ROl grant publicly targeted by Fox News reporters at the Presidential press briefing last night, I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus’ origins. Once this pandemic’s over I look forward thanking you in person and let you know how important your comments are to us all.” Fauci responded to the email the day after, writing “Peter: Many thanks for your kind note. Best Regards, Tony” Daszak, who also works for the World Health Organisation, is on record admitting that he was involved with manipulating coronaviruses. Here is a video of him talking in DECEMBER 2019 about how ‘good’ the viruses are for messing around within a lab. Daszak notes that “coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily… the spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.” Elsewhere, the emails show that Fauci also knew very early on, before the WHO even declared a pandemic, that researchers suspected the virus had been ‘potentially engineered’ in a lab, as this exchange with Kristian G. Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute from January 2020 shows. The emails with Fauci show that Daszak had already dismissed the lab leak notion nearly a year before that ‘investigation’ began, and despite other researchers saying it looked potentially engineered. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this is that Daszak was one of the lead “investigators” on the WHO panel tasked with looking into the origins of the pandemic. Is it any surprise that this guy, whose organization has shoveled at least $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the past few years to play around with coronaviruses inside the lab, determined within 3 hours of visiting the lab in February 2021 that there was ‘nothing to see here’? Daszak, like Fauci, has also since denied that there was any gain of function research being conducted at the Wuhan lab, and that it wasn’t being funded by EcoHealth Alliance or via the NIH with US tax dollars. These are blatant lies, as there are mountains of evidence that confirm this was exactly the case. Why would they deny it when it can be so easily proven the research was being conducted? Another interesting factoid about Daszak is that he was employed as an ‘expert fact checker’ by Facebook when it was monitoring and removing ‘misinformation’ about the origins of COVID on its platform. If all of that doesn’t scream coverup then what does? Find the email dump here. All this were under CCP supervision. They deleted the tweet but have a look at this. They were so proud to say that they have the ""largest bank virus in Asia"". Take a look as well on the fridges condition… https://t.co/1MWEflBhi1 — Alain B. (@alainb_) June 2, 2021"
Vaccine Expert Blows The Whistle: “We Made A Big Mistake”,1 JUN 2021,9084,"If you’ve wondered why so many young, otherwise healthy, people are dying from blood clots after getting the mRNA vaccine, an expert is about to explain. Apparently, scientists made a “big mistake” concerning the spike protein, which is itself a “toxin.” Undercover DC explained: Canadian vaccine expert Dr. Byram Bridle recently spoke of the terrifying reasons serious side effects, including heart inflammation and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), may occur in those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. He explained that critical information has recently been discovered that centers around spike proteins—a crucial element in both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Bridle, Associate Professor of Viral Immunology at the University of Guelph, received funding to develop a novel vaccine platform and is very much pro-vaccine. Nonetheless, he insists science must be properly performed and then followed carefully before entering into the public rollout of vaccines. Brindle, who stated the importance of sharing this new information openly, recently visited On Point with Alex Pierson and spoke at length on the “scary” situation facing humanity as the push to vaccinate the global population against SARS-CoV-2 gains momentum. He explained that, through cutting edge, peer-reviewed science, we’ve learned more about the many problems associated with spike proteins and COVID-19 vaccines: “The SARS-CoV-2 has a spike protein on its surface. We now know spike protein gets into circulation. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen; we never knew it was a toxin. So by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.” SARS-CoV-2—which has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice and cause many kinds of heart, blood vessel, and brain damage—has a spike protein on its surface, allowing the virus to infect our bodies. Likewise, research within the scientific community also reveals various cardiovascular and heart problems, bleeding, and clotting when studying the disease in humans. That same research also establishes that the spike protein alone is almost entirely responsible for damage to the cardiovascular system if circulating in the body.  Generally speaking, there are many different kinds and types of vaccines, all with the same objective—tricking a healthy body into thinking it is under attack by a particular disease so the immune system will learn to create the cells and proteins necessary to swiftly destroy the pathogen if it becomes a threat. Since spike proteins cause the coronavirus infection, they are the catalyst used in COVID-19 vaccines. Essentially, the assumption behind COVID-19 vaccines is their ability to enable the cells in our bodies to produce spike protein. When an immune response is launched against the spike protein, the virus stops infecting the body. At first glance, this information seems relatively straightforward. When administered, COVID-19 vaccines are injected into the shoulder muscle—not into the blood. Until recently, the opinion has been that these vaccines function like traditional vaccines and remain near the injection site. Bridle details further, explaining: “The assumption until now has been that these vaccines behave like all of our traditional vaccines; that they don’t go anywhere, they stay in our shoulder. Some of the protein will go to the local draining lymph node in order to activate the immune system.” Shockingly, according to Bridle, the COVID-19 vaccine is different from traditional vaccines. For the first time ever, the Japanese Regulatory Agency recently gave Bridle and several international collaborators access to a study called “the Bio-Distribution Study.” The groundbreaking research presents scientists with a more reliable understanding of where COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines travel in the body after being injected. Bridle explains the study absolutely refutes the premise that the COVID-19 vaccine stays in the shoulder muscle, asserting:  “The short answer—is absolutely not. It’s very disconcerting. The spike protein gets into the blood, circulates through the blood in individuals over several days post-vaccination. Once it gets in the blood, it accumulates in a number of tissues such as the spleen, the bone marrow, the liver, the adrenal glands. And of particular concern for me is it accumulates in the ovaries, in quite high concentrations.”  Moreover, a scientific paper just accepted for publication in the Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America supports this frightening hypothesis. The research examined thirteen young healthcare workers who had received the Moderna vaccine. Scientists discovered the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein circulating in the blood of eleven of the thirteen healthcare workers. Bridle emphasized that the spike protein could cross the blood-brain barrier, causing neurological damage, explaining why fatal blood clots are often seen in the brain. Elaborating on the implications of these findings, he remarked:  “We have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin that can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation. Now, we have clear-cut evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles manufacture this protein, [we now know] the vaccine itself plus the protein gets into blood circulation. When in circulation, the spike protein can bind to the receptors that are on our platelets and the cells that line our blood vessels. When that happens, it can do one of two things: it can either cause platelets to clump, and that can lead to clotting—that’s exactly why we’ve been seeing clotting disorders associated with these vaccines. It can also lead to bleeding, and of course, the heart is involved, which is part of the cardiovascular system, so that is why we are seeing heart problems.” 5. There were indeed some cases of severe disease in children during the spring of 2020 https://t.co/cSoxc1vbCa – but this wave has receded as the pandemic has run its course. Vaccinating children in this context is: — Doctors for Covid Ethics (@Drs4CovidEthics) May 29, 2021 Additionally, according to Bridle, an alarming study not yet accepted for publication that initially attempted to verify that antibodies from the vaccine get transferred through breast milk (suggesting some protection for babies), instead inadvertently discovered the mRNA vaccine spike proteins are transferred through the breast milk, thus passing the COVID-19 vaccine vector itself into breastfeeding infants. Since any protein in the blood will concentrate in breast milk, observing that the spike protein gets into circulation is even more disturbing. Bridle maintains the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database presents evidence of breastfeeding infants encountering bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract.
 What does this startling discovery mean for blood donations? Current Red Cross guidelines state, “In most cases, there’s no deferral time if you receive a vaccine,” a protocol which doesn’t sit well with Bridle, who remarked, “We don’t want [a] transfer of these pathogenic spike proteins to fragile patients” who might need a blood transfusion. According to Bridle, the discovery also has implications for breastfeeding infants and severe consequences for people for whom the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not a high-risk pathogen, including all children. Rightly, Bridle is extremely troubled about the current drive to vaccinate children against COVID-19, recently stating insufficient evidence exists to claim the benefits outweigh the risk of vaccinating the younger population. Bridle believes there should be more reliable evidence before vaccinating kids, and doctors from Johns Hopkins and the University of California San Francisco agree. Consistent data shows the virus is less severe than influenza in children, strengthening the argument of “do kids need the vaccine?” Voicing his concern, Bridle asserts: “That’s not how this is supposed to work; our kids should not be the guinea pigs. Stop using our children as shields in this battle that is an adult battle.” Listen to this https://t.co/1jrYwYAnvw — Dr Sherri Tenpenny (@BusyDrT) May 30, 2021 As questions intensify surrounding the true origins of SARS-CoV-2, the devastating discovery that spike proteins reach the bloodstream leaves wide open the door for many other legitimate questions about the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines—for example, with it accumulating in the ovaries, will we be rendering some young people infertile?—Bridle concluded:  “We made a big mistake; we didn’t realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So, by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. Some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens, in some people, they can cause damage, especially to the cardiovascular system.” "
"Video Shows Capitol Police Attacking Children, Elderly Citizens In Lawful Assembly",1 JUN 2021,1698,"Apparently, after carefully waving through Antifa and BLM agitators dressed like Trump supporters, capitol police then attacked the women, children, and elderly veterans who were located in lawful assembly locations. The Gateway Pundit reported: On Jan. 6 Capitol Police started firing flash grenades and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters with US and MAGA flags. From the video, you can see the protesters are NOT on the Capitol steps and were behind barriers. There were children, veterans, and seniors in the crowd. The protesters were packed tightly together and the Capitol Police started firing on them. Last week Julie Kelly from American Greatness released a video from Jan. 6 protests in Washington DC.  Police started firing on the peaceful protestors on the west side of the Capitol building. In the video at American Greatness you can see Kash Kelly, a former gang member and founder of the Streetlights Unity Movement and Foundation, a group he launched in 2020 in opposition to Black Lives Matters to help at-risk people in inner-cities, outraged that police were firing on this crowd of patriots with American flags and MAGA gear. Over the weekend The Gateway Pundit was sent a second video of the Capitol Police firing on the Jan. 6 crowd of men, women, children and seniors. In this video you can see in slow motion the flash grenade fired out over the crowd and into the crowd. The Trump supporters had nowhere to move to and many had NO IDEA what was about to hit them! Flash bang grenades in close range can cause hearing loss, eye damage, and other injuries. This is your government Declaring War on its people! DON’T EXPECT the Fake-News Mainstream Media to touch this one."
BLM Leader Forced To ‘Suspend’ School Board Activities After 62 (and Counting) Victims Come Forward,1 JUN 2021,9667,"Tay Anderson, a prominent BLM leader and school board official, has been forced to suspend his official duties after at least 62 DACA student victims have come forward claiming sexual abuse. The Gateway Pundit reported: A local Denver school board member, Black Lives Matter protest leader, and anti-gun activist is facing dozens of accusations of sex abuse, rape, harassment, and “inappropriate behavior” from a variety of community members, including 62 high school students and illegal aliens in the DACA program, at least one as young as 14. Tay Anderson is denying the allegations and hopes to continue his work on the school board and in activism, but more victims continue to come forward. He is now stepping aside from his duties while the investigation continues. Chalkbeat Colorado reports: Denver school board member Tay Anderson said Sunday he would step back from “everyday board functions” until an outside firm hired by the school district completes an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him. In a separate statement, the school board clarified that Anderson will still vote on key matters, including the selection of a new superintendent, which is set to happen June 3. A Denver Public Schools spokesperson said Anderson’s stepping back means Anderson will not attend school or district meetings with staff or students. Anderson announced his decision two days after the school board announced it was aware of new allegations against him. Anderson is under investigation by an outside firm hired by Denver Public Schools. The district launched the investigation after the civil rights group Black Lives Matter 5280 said in March that a woman came to them to report that Anderson had sexually assaulted her. Separate from that accusation, former members of anti-gun violence group Never Again Colorado said that Anderson engaged in inappropriate behavior when he was the group’s president in 2018. Then this week, Denver parent Mary-Katherine Brooks Fleming testified before a Colorado legislative committee that 62 young people, nearly all of them current Denver high school students, came to her starting in August seeking help and protection from a specific man “in a position of trust.” She said they had experienced abuse ranging from unwanted touching to violent rape. Anderson has consistently denied all allegations against him. He said Sunday that he expects to be cleared and return to all his duties. The Denver Post elaborates: Denver Public Schools acknowledged Friday night that its board and the Denver Police Department are aware of new sexual assault allegations against school board member Tay Anderson after a woman testified this week before a legislative committee about a sexual predator within the school system who has targeted students. On Tuesday, Mary-Katherine Brooks Fleming, a parent of three DPS students, told the state House Judiciary Committee there is “a sexual predator targeting DPS children” during her public testimony in support of a bill that would make it easier for victims to sue institutions who employ child sexual abusers. Brooks Fleming told the committee 62 people had come to her for help regarding a single individual, but she did not name that person. Their experiences ranged from unwanted touching to “violent acts of rape,” she said. Sixty-one of them lacked documentation or were recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and the youngest was 14, she said. “Those who came to my home didn’t have health insurance, couldn’t afford emergency rooms, and even if they could, they wanted to avoid mandatory reporters for fear that such an interaction could jeopardize their family,” Brooks Fleming said in her testimony. “It is horrifying to realize that someone had preyed on these children, knowing their silence was guaranteed.” In a statement emailed to The Post on Friday night, the Denver Public Schools Board of Education stated, “The Board was made aware of testimony at the Colorado Capitol this week and was later informed that the accusations were against Director Tay Anderson. The Denver police are also aware of these accusations.” The Denver Police Department’s investigators have spoken with Brooks Fleming about her comments, but they have not heard from any victims, Jay Casillas, a department spokesman, said in an email to The Post. “If someone is a victim, we encourage them to contact Denver Police,” Casillas wrote. Anderson, who has been under investigation by the school district for a single sexual assault allegation since early April, referred questions to his attorney, Christopher Decker. Decker denied the allegations on behalf of his client. In a statement to The Denver Post, Decker wrote, “Nothing is worse or more unacceptable than the harm caused by sexual assault upon our children, or the related harm caused by not believing those who have been victimized in this way. This is also why false assertions of these horrible crimes act to cheapen and diminish its importance. It is because of these two truths that responsible people and organizations must carefully investigate such inflammatory claims completely, and with an open and fair process.” Mary-Katherine Brooks Fleming’s posted her testimony on Twitter: Rapist in Denver Public Schools, Testimony on SB21-088 https://t.co/eSI5pr1qsv — Coach MK/Your Protest Mom  (@CoachMKFleming) May 26, 2021 The Denver Post story continues: Brooks Fleming, who is active in Denver’s social justice community and who has volunteered at Blue Bench, a nonprofit organization that aids sexual assault victims, previously had declined to name the person she was accusing to The Post. Anderson has been under scrutiny for an alleged sexual assault since March 26 when Black Lives Matter 5280 published a public statement saying a woman came to the group in February to report that Anderson had sexually assaulted her. The statement said the woman wanted Anderson to issue a public apology and to seek help from a licensed professional. In a news conference two days later with Decker at his side, Anderson denied the allegation, saying he was not aware of any situation that could be construed as sexual assault. He also welcomed any investigation into the accusation. The Denver Public Schools board hired the Investigation Law Group, an outside firm, to investigate the situation. On May 18, the school board said the firm was conducting final interviews and was expected to produce its report within the next 30 days. However, Brooks Fleming’s testimony came after that announcement was made and on Friday the district said the investigation remains open. Black Lives Matter 5280 released this statement regarding Anderson’s alleged abuse within their organization. Anderson is attempting to play the victim, saying a web hacker has orchestrated all of this, as KDVR FOX 31 reports: Anderson’s attorney, Chris Decker — who’s also a FOX31 legal analyst — said in a statement that no one has come forward with any more information about the allegations, including some brought forth in March, and that police have not contacted him, either. Decker also said “a known racist criminal web hacker … claims (to me and others) to have orchestrated these false allegations against Director Anderson” — information he said has been reported to police. “On behalf of Director Anderson, I ask only for a responsible and thorough investigation of these concerning matters and assure the public that if that is done, he will be cleared of any and all wrongdoing,” Decker said. “The only thing worse than sexual assault on children, or the denial or coverup of the same, is weaponizing false claims of sexual assault and irresponsibly publishing or concluding it has happened when it has not.” Anderson released this generic statement via his Twitter page, but doesn’t address any of the accusations: Statement from Director Anderson: pic.twitter.com/xafuE8YJwB — Tay Anderson (@TayAndersonCO) May 29, 2021 Anderson was apparently injured by police when protesting against a homeless camp clean up. He vowed that the “City of Denver, you fucked with the wrong person” while wearing his official school board name badge. Oh but it gets better for Mr. Anderson! Back in 2018 he was found guilty of retaliation after someone came forward with another set of accusations of abuse. Westword reports: But Anderson, 22, acknowledges that a May 2018 Denver Public Schools investigation found that he had engaged in retaliation while advocating on behalf of former Manual High School Principal Nick Dawkins, whom the district had investigated following employee complaints of harassment and bias. A Dawkins accuser tells Westword that retaliation took the form of social media posts aimed at her that began appearing the previous month. She viewed it as harassment of a person who’d made claims of harassment. “In early 2018, I worked at Manual High School as a paraprofessional,” Anderson says in a statement provided to Westword. “During that time period, I posted my concerns about another Black leader leaving Denver Public Schools on several social media channels. I was informed that my social media activity could interfere with the investigation regarding that leader. When I continued to speak out on social media, it was determined that my actions were retaliatory.” Anderson was a prominent figure during the George Floyd protests last year. Among his many other stunts are when he vowed to stay seated during the Pledge Of Allegiance at school board meetings. Anderson held this press conference the other day: All suspects are, of course, innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  "
Biden Regime Stops President Trump’s Investigation Into Wuhan COVID Origins,27 MAY 2021,2812,"Joe Biden and his regime are controlled by China, a fact that was made clear (again) yesterday. Breitbart News explained: President Joe Biden shut down a State Department probe this spring into the origins of COVID-19 in China that was launched by the Trump administration under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last fall, according to a CNN report Tuesday. Last year, concerns voiced by President Donald Trump that COVID-19 might have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China, were dismissed by media fact-checkers as conspiracy theories. Now, however, those concerns are gaining traction. The Biden administration has said that it wants China to be more transparent, and wants the World Health Organization (WHO) to conduct an independent inquiry. But the WHO is widely seen as having helped China cover up the pandemic  CNN reported: President Joe Biden‘s team shut down a closely-held State Department effort launched late in the Trump administration to prove the coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab over concerns about the quality of its work, according to three sources familiar with the decision. The existence of the State Department inquiry and its termination this spring by the Biden administration — neither of which has been previously reported — comes to light amid renewed interest in whether the virus could have leaked out of a Wuhan lab with links to the Chinese military. The Biden administration is also facing scrutiny of its own efforts to determine if the Chinese government was responsible for the virus. Those involved in the previously undisclosed inquiry, which was launched last fall by allies of then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, say it was an honest effort to probe what many initially dismissed: that China’s biological weapons program could have had a greater role in the pandemic’s origin in Wuhan, according to two additional sources. But the inquiry quickly became mired in internal discord amid concerns that it was part of a broader politicized effort by the Trump administration to blame China and cherry-pick facts to prove a theory. Ironically, then-candidate Joe Biden and others criticized President Trump during the 2020 campaign for allegedly having “dissolved” the White House pandemic unit (in fact, it was reorganized in ways that advocates said made it more effective). Biden also claimed, falsely, that Trump had “rolled over for the Chinese” and that he did not ask China to allow the U.S. to investigate the coronavirus. Biden promised he would “insist, insist, insist” that China had to let the U.S. in to investigate. Now, Biden has reportedly dissolved an effort to investigate the origins of the pandemic, and has “rolled over for the Chinese” rather than insisting that the U.S. be allowed to conduct its own investigation of how the COVID-19 virus emerged."
"Biden Regime Ends Program Identifying Child Predators, Violent Criminal Illegal ‘Immigrants’",26 MAY 2021,3069,"The Biden regime is following along with the plan to establish massive unrest, increased crime, and general societal chaos, which will help usher in full state control of citizens. In the latest move, they’ve ended an effective program designed to catch alien criminals. The Center for Immigration Studies reported: The Biden administration seems to be upset that the successful 287(g) program in Bristol County, Mass., has resulted in the identification of illegal aliens arrested for child rape, assault, strangulation, arson, attempted murder, armed carjacking, breaking and entering, and identity theft, and they plan to put an end to this public safety program immediately, no matter the cost to public safety. This is consistent with the administration’s enforcement priorities and would ensure that countless criminal aliens are released into our communities. The 287(g) program, created by Congress decades back, allows local law enforcement to enter into cooperative agreements with federal immigration authorities to assist with the identification and processing of removable aliens arrested for violations of criminal law. Local law enforcement that partners with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) receives weeks of training on how to identify removable aliens that they encounter during their routine enforcement of state and local criminal law. It’s a commonsense program considering that local law enforcement, not ICE, is often the first to encounter criminal aliens. The program has led to the arrest and removal of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens. In fiscal year 2020, state and local law enforcement trained under 287(g) encountered approximately 920 aliens convicted for assault, 1,261 convicted for dangerous drugs, 104 convicted for sex offenses/assaults, 377 convicted for obstructing police, 190 convicted for weapon offenses, and 37 convicted for homicide, to name a few crimes. As of May 2021, ICE has 287(g) agreements with 71 law enforcement agencies in 21 states. ICE has an additional 76 agreements in 11 states based on a more narrowly-focused version of the program. Below is a sampling of criminal aliens encountered by the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office since October 2019. These case studies highlighting the effectiveness of the program are contained in a monthly report produced by ICE’s 287(g) Unit. The monthly reports are available online. It is almost hard to believe, but these are the very types of aliens DHS Secretary Mayorkas does not want ICE to take custody of and deport: In addition to President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas, a handful of members of Congress are also calling for the release of child rapists, armed carjackers, and other criminal aliens into our communities. Those members of Congress from Massachusetts pushing for an end to the Bristol County 287(g) agreement include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Edward Markey, Rep. William Keating, Rep. James McGovern, Rep. Lori Trahan, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Rep. Jake Auchincloss, Rep. Seth Moulton, Rep. Katherine Clark, and Rep. Richard Neal."
"First COVID Vax Recipient Dead From ‘Unrelated Issues,’ Model Dead With Strange Blood Clot",26 MAY 2021,5811,"The COVID vaccine, many experts have continually warned, is more deadly than the virus itself. Two more people who’ve been experimented on have died. The Telegraph reported: The Scottish Sun reported: A BRITISH model has died days after being given the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in Cyprus, a health official has said. Stephanie Dubois, 39, had posted on Facebook: “I am completely drained, [have] no energy and my whole body hurts with sore and weak joints.” Who was Stephanie Dubois? Stephanie Dubois was a British model who had been living in Paphos, but died in Nicosia general hospital. The 39-year-old had been living in Tsada, Paphos, for the past five months, according to the Cyprus Mail. Stephanie, who died on Saturday, May 22, 2021, had been hoping to travel with a friend to Australia after Covid restrictions ease to “go on a spectacular camping trip”, posted a “heartbroken” pal on Facebook. Her friend had been hoping for a “miracle recovery” while Stephanie was in a coma after surgery. Close pals and colleagues have shared many tributes on social media to Stephanie, hailing her as “super-talented” and “a fantastic professional model”. Jon Miller said he was “heartbroken” after “my dear friend passed away. To all… in creative art, we not only knew her as a perfectionist, but she brought so much joy to our work. “Stephanie loved what she did as a model, and that showed in her work. She made our lives brighter.” Alastair Currill Photography said people were “in shock” over her death. The firm said: “The photography industry has lost a great model, friend and fellow creative. Taken away way too early.” Paul Cooley said on Facebook that the modelling community had “lost a fantastic model and a good soul”. He added: “She was a lovely person to know and had a great heart. RIP Stephanie, you will be missed.” What was her cause of death? Stephanie is understood to have developed a “very rare” blood clot and died days after being given the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in Cyprus. She suffered a serious thrombotic episode after being given the jab in the town of Paphos, said a health official. The model received a first dose of the vaccination on May 6. She later posted on Facebook: “So I had the vaccination today! I hate needles, today was no exception . . . And now I feel horrendous . . . pizza and bed for me.” Days later, Stephanie wrote: “Woke up feeling fine and then within an hour I had full body shakes, all my joints seized and I was struggling to breathe and was cold to the bone with a persistent headache and dizziness. “Mum and dad came to look after me and took me for a Covid test, which thankfully was negative . . . but it still doesn’t explain what the problem is. Maybe I’m having a prolonged reaction to my Covid jab last week.” On May 14, Stephanie was taken to hospital with breathing problems. Thanking everyone for their “kind words and well wishes”, she also praised her “wonderful clients who have been so understanding”. She added on Facebook on May 14: “I have had my bloods done and there is definitely something off as my white blood cell count is high, but they don’t know what is causing it. “Maybe I’m having a prolonged reaction to my Covid jab last week, or maybe those effects affected my immune system, and I’ve caught something else in the process. “I am completely drained, no energy and my whole body hurts with sore and weak joints… but it is better than this morning. “This morning really scared me to be honest. I have cleared my diary for the week and will be taking that time to rest and get back on form. “Thanks to all you lovely lot xx.” Sadly, by May 19, 2021, she had slipped into a coma and “was not expected to come out of it”, according to Andrew Powers, a friend. Local media reported that she had suffered a brain haemorrhage and died on the afternoon of Saturday, May 22. Health officials at Cyprus’s main state hospital in the capital, Nicosia, said that she had no underlying health conditions. Charalambos Charilaou, Cypriot health service spokesman, said that her death would be investigated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Four other cases of “mild” blood clotting incidents – three of which occurred after an AstraZeneca shot and one after a Pfizer jab – are also being investigated by Cyprus. What are the AstraZeneca risks? Side-effects can occur with all medications, and coronavirus vaccines are no exception to this. Millions of people have safely received an AstraZeneca jab. Experts say the risks are massively outweighed by the jab’s benefits for most people. In April, the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed that seven people had died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. But it was not clear if this was a coincidence or a side-effect from the jab, reported BBC News. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said: “We have been aware of the rare blood clots that we think are linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. “But it’s not always possible to say the vaccine caused it. There may be other contributory factors. “The vast, vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccines are very mild. You do have severe cases, but only very rarely.” As of April 28, 2021, the MHRA had received 242 reports of blood clotting cases in people who also had low levels of platelets in the UK, following the use of Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. It means the overall chance is just 10 in a million. This is a tiny amount compared to the millions of people who have had the jab. People who have had the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine should seek help if they experience a severe headache or shortness of breath, experts have warned. There are six symptoms people need to look out for from around four days to four weeks after vaccination:"
"Iowa, Alabama Join Number of States Prohibiting Vaccine Passports",25 MAY 2021,2612,"Both Iowa and Alabama have joined the growing number of states prohibiting COVID vaccine passports, which would inhibit and violated the freedoms of U.S. citizens. The Epoch Times explained: Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey have signed bills into law, joining other states that prohibit COVID-19 vaccine passports at the state level. Ivey signed Senate Bill 267 (pdf) into law on May 24, while Reynolds signed House File 889 into law on May 20. “Since the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, both Dr. Harris [the state health officer] and I have said that we would not mandate vaccines in the state of Alabama. I am supportive of a voluntary vaccine, and by signing this bill into law, I am only further solidifying that conviction,” Ivey said in a statement. Reynolds said she “strongly oppose[s] vaccine passports” last month and that she would like to take legislative or executive action. The two laws are similar. Both prohibit state agencies from issuing identifications that show personal vaccine records, and further state that no business or government entities should require proof of vaccination to provide admission or service. The Iowa version specifically targets COVID-19 related vaccine passports while the Alabama version seems to be not limited to COVID-19, only stating “immunizations” and “vaccines.” Iowa further requires that “grants or contracts funded by state revenue shall not be awarded to or renewed with respect to a business or governmental entity” that violates the law. The Alabama version doesn’t provide any punishment mechanism. States have taken two paths to counter vaccine passports, either through executive orders or legislation. Governors from Texas, Idaho, Arizona, South Dakota, Montana, South Carolina, and Wyoming have issued executive orders to ban COVID-19 vaccine passports, while Utah, Arkansas, and North Dakota have passed bills into law to deal with the issue. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis first issued an executive order in early April and then signed a bill into law in May to ban vaccine passports. Vaccine passport systems have come under fire recently for concerns over data security, individual freedoms, health care privacy, and dividing society into classes. Meanwhile, Hawaii, New York, and some parts of California have rolled out programs for digital passports that track testing and vaccination status for the CCP virus. Last week, the Biden administration reiterated that the federal government won’t implement or support a vaccine passport system, suggesting that the matter will be left to private businesses and local authorities."
Facebook Busted By Veritas: Global Plan For Vaccine,25 MAY 2021,1756,"Facebook is determined to silence all vaccine dissent. Project Veritas explained: Facebook has responded: “We proactively announced this policy on our company blog and also updated our help center with this information.” -Facebook company spokesperson [Westchester, NY – May 24, 2021] Two Facebook Insiders have come forward to Project Veritas with leaked internal documents, showing the Big Tech giant’s plan to police “Vaccine Hesitancy” (VH) through surreptitious “comment demotion.” The company has set up a tier system to rank comments on various scales, based on how much the statement questions or cautions against the Covid-19 vaccination. Tier 2, for instance, represents “Indirect Discouragement” of getting vaccinated and according to PV’s sources, user comments such as these would be heavily “suppressed.” It doesn’t matter if the comments are true, factual or represent reality. The comment is demoted, buried and hidden from view of the public if it clashes with this system. “It doesn’t match the narrative,” one insider explained. “The narrative being, get the vaccine, the vaccine is good for you. Everyone should get it. And if you don’t, you will be singled out,” One of the insiders, a Data Center Technician, leaked multiple internal documents detailing an algorithm test being run on 1.5 percent of Facebook and Instagram’s nearly 3.8 billion users worldwide. The goal? To, “drastically reduce user exposure to vaccine hesitancy (VH) in comments.” “They’re trying to control this content before it even makes it onto your page before you even see it,” one insider said.

Republican Claims He “Forgot” To Vote Against Pelosi’s Pork ‘Protection’ Bill?,24 MAY 2021,5934,"In an unexplainable action, Ken Calvert (R) claims he forgot to cast a proxy vote, which would have stopped Pelosi’s capitol security (aka witch hunt against patriots) in its track. Breitbart News explained: Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA) “forgot” to cast a proxy vote on behalf of Rep. John Carter (R-TX), which ultimately would have killed the $1.9 trillion Capitol security funding bill that passed by one vote on Thursday, according to a report. Carter submitted a letter to the clerk of the House of Representatives dated May 14 giving Calvert authority to cast his vote by proxy “due to the ongoing public health emergency.” The final vote for the bill was 213 to 212. A no vote from Carter would have tied the vote. A tied vote would have sunk the bill in the House since it would have blocked it from passing. The House cannot break a tying vote like the Senate, where the vice president can vote when the votes are tied. According to Just the News, who first reported on this, Carter had successfully voted by proxy on the “the motion to recommit” earlier in the day, just not the final vote on the supplemental security bill. A spokesperson for Carter had told Just the News the congressman “would have voted against the bill if his proxy vote was counted for the final vote.” Additionally, the spokesperson said, “The congressman included a statement in the record that he would’ve voted no.” Just the News had asked a spokesperson in Calvert’s office why the proxy on the final vote on the 1.9 billion bill was not counted. The spokesperson answered, “Rep. Calvert had been voting by proxy for Rep. Carter throughout the week.” The spokesperson had also added, “Rep. Calvert made a mistake and simply forgot to cast Rep. Carter’s vote.” The records show Calvert voted in-person on the final vote. According to the House clerk who keeps the records of all congressional members using proxy voting published rules allowing them to use the right “Pursuant to House Resolution 8, 117th Congress, and House Resolution 965, 116th Congress.” that allows the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to designate certain times, members are allowed to vote by proxy. During the pandemic, Pelosi has given representatives the option to vote by proxy or in-person. Breitbart News reported last week Democrat Rep. Jared Golden (ME) had used proxy voting to help Pelosi pass the bill, with the one-vote margin, after he had previously pledged not to use the voting style; for “family responsibilities.” Rep. Daniel Webster also did not vote on the bill. According to the report, he has been opposed to the use of proxy voting and was unable to vote in-person. A spokesperson for Webster told the Just the News, “Rep. Webster missed votes because he was unavoidably detained in the district and wasn’t able to make it to D.C. in time to make the votes.” “He likely would have opposed the bill — he didn’t proxy vote on principle as he is on the record opposing proxy-voting and was part of the original lawsuit challenging its constitutionality,” the spokesperson for Webster added. Just The News added: Members of the so-called “Squad” of progressive lawmakers nearly took down a bill backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that provides $1.9 billion in supplemental security funding at the U.S. Capitol following the Jan. 6 riot. Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, voted against the bill, while New York Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan did not take a position on the bill and voted present. Two GOP members did not cast a recorded vote, and every other Republican opposed the bill. It narrowly passed 213-212. A tied vote in the House means that the measure fails. Following the passage of the bill, Omar said, “I am frankly tired of any time where there is a failure in our system of policing, the first response is for us to give them more money.” Pressley, Bush and Omar released a joint statement that outlined their objection to the legislation. “A bill that pours $1.9 billion into increased police surveillance and force without addressing the underlying threats of organized and violent white supremacy, radicalization, and disinformation that led to this attack will not prevent it from happening again,” said the lawmakers. “Increasing law enforcement funds does not inherently protect or safeguard the Capitol Hill or surrounding D.C. community. In fact, this bill is being passed before we have any real investigation into the events of January 6th and the failures involved because Republicans have steadfastly obstructed the creation of a January 6th commission.” The Democratic lawmakers also said the bill does “far too little to address the unspeakable trauma of the countless officers, staff, and support workers who were on site that day — dedicating fifty times more money to the creation of a ‘quick reaction force’ than it does to counseling.” The lawmakers said they could not support “this increased funding while many of our communities continue to face police brutality while marching in the streets, and while questions about the disparate response between insurrectionists and those protesting in defense of Black lives go unanswered.” The progressive lawmakers argued that the bill “prioritizes more money for a broken system that has long upheld and protected the white supremacist violence we saw on display that day.” In addition to creating the new “quick reaction force,” the bill would also provide funding for the installation of a retractable fence around the U.S. Capitol building. In the last session of Congress, Squad members raised speculation about how often they would vote against Pelosi-backed legislation. In December 2020, some of the progressive lawmakers in the Squad voted against advancing a large coronavirus stimulus bill that was attached to regular government appropriations."
"Fauci Backtracks On COVID Origins, Admits Funding To Wuhan As Lackey On China Board",24 MAY 2021,8956,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is a deep state conniver who helped destroy the country and pave the way for the election rig by funding and helping the development of COVID… and now he’s backtracking on previous lies. The Gateway Pundit explained: The Rat-in-a-Trap Dr. Fauci finally admitted in his latest flip-flop that the COVID-19 virus may not have occurred naturally. Fauci made the comments on far-left Politifact channel, an organization that itself has been pushing fake news on the COVID crisis for over a year. Politifact hack: Sen. Rand Paul, who you have tangled with in the past, suggested that you and the NIH funded risky research that eventually down the line was connected to COVID-19? I don’t want to dwell on this for too long but I do want to give you that chance to react to his comments today. Dr. Fauci: That’s actually preposterous. To bring something up is really not helpful. He was saying that we funded a kind of research in China that could lead to dangerous research. That’s not the case. So what he was saying was absolutely not true. It is really unfortunate that he brought that up. It really does nothing but cloud the issue of what we are trying to do. So it was just unfortunate that he said that. Politifact hack: That has been the subject for a lot of our fact-checking on the coronavirus for the past year. There’s a lot of cloudiness around the origins of COVID-19 still. So I wanted to ask are you still confident that COVID developed naturally? Dr. Fauci: No actually, that’s the point that I said. And I think that the real unfortunate aspect of what Senator Paul did was he was conflating research in a collaborative way with Chinese scientists which was — you’d almost have to say that if we did not do that then we’d be almost irresponsible because SARS-COVI-1 clearly originated in China… So we really had to learn a whole lot about the viruses that were there, about whether or not people were getting infected with bad viruses. So in a very minor collaboration as part of a sub-contract as part of a grant, we had a collaboration with some Chinese scientists. And what he conflated that was that we were involved in creating the virus. Which is the most ridiculous majestic leap I’ve ever heard of. There it is.
Fauci just admitted:
** The virus may not have originated naturally — something he refuted earlier until now
** The US DID FUND Chinese research at the Wuhan Labs
** The US funded this research through NIH grants under his leadership This was right after he accused Senator Paul of lying about this collaboration. We now know that Senator Paul was 100% correct in his assertions during his Senate testimony. And we now know that Dr. Anthony Fauci LIED while testifying to the senate committee. He was not under oath but the same rules apply during any senatorial testimony. Fauci funded the Wuhan labs that leaked the COVID-19 virus and then shut down the US economy after the virus came to America. It is hard to fathom how much damage this one man did to our country — and then lied about it for months. And, for the record, Rand Paul brought the receipts. Here is the video via The Storm Has Arrived– FYI — In May 2020, TGP reported this: The leader of the US task force overseeing the country’s response to the China coronavirus, Dr. Tony Fauci, was the one who funded the Wuhan bat virus work and kept it going. And, one more thing — The frauds at Politifact “fact-checked” The Gateway Pundit for our reporting on the lab back in 2020. We were right and they were completely incorrect. Furthermore, when the truth clubbed Politifact, they only quietly updated their records. The Gateway Pundit added: Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures this AM. Cotton is famously the first politician to suggest back in February 2020 that the COVID-19 virus originated in a Wuhan, China lab. During their discussion, Senator Cotton suggested that the NIH funding by Dr. Fauci to the Wuhan labs could be a “genuine scandal.” Senator Cotton: “It is imperative that the NIH come clean and tell us exactly what happened… Well, I think that a lot of these so-called experts and scientific bureaucrats are trying to cover their tracks. Again, this could be a genuine scandal. This could be public health bureaucrats violating explicit direction from the Obama White House to continue research that is highly, highly dangerous and particularly susceptible to escape from a laboratory. Especially a laboratory in China.” Via Sunday Morning Futures: National Pulse reported: Dr. Anthony Fauci, who discredited the Trump administration’s claims that COVID-19 escaped from a Chinese lab, now insists he’s “not convinced” the virus has natural origins. Fauci’s comments came during an interview with PolitiFact’s Katie Sanders as part of the Chinese Communist Party-linked company’s United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking event. “Are you still confident that it developed naturally,” Sanders questioned the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director. “No, actually,” Fauci responded. He continued, adding he was “not convinced” that the virus has natural origins: “No. I’m not convinced about that. I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened. Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favor of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus.” Fauci’s newfound skepticism of COVID-19’s natural origins is at odds with his former stance on the issue. As a National Geographic article from May 2020 reveals: “Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” Fauci says. Based on the scientific evidence, he also doesn’t entertain an alternate theory—that someone found the coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab, and then it accidentally escaped. Mainstream media outlets spun the NIAID Director’s remarks as a rebuke of the Trump administration’s claims that COVID-19 was traceable to the Wuhan Institue of Virology. The National Pulse explained: The Wuhan Institute of Virology’s scientific journal – which has discussed controversial “gain-of-function” research – counts scientists from Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on its editorial board. The Editor-in-Chief of the journal – Virologica Sinica – is Shi Zhengli, the Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases. Eight additional researchers from the Wuhan lab – believed by many to be the source of COVID-19 – serve on the editorial board. Another member of the journal’s editorial board, however, has ties to Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Jens Kuhn, the Director of Virology at the Integrated Research Facility which is “part of the NIAID’s Division of Clinical Research (DCR) within NIH” according to the agency, is listed as a member of the journal’s editorial board. His professional bio notes he “specializes in highly virulent viral human and animal pathogens” as one of “two Principal Scientists” at the NIAID-funded venture: “I am a Principal at Tunnell Government Services (TGS), tasked as one of two Principal Scientists and the Director of Virology at NIH/NIAID/DCR’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick (IRF-Frederick) in MD, USA. I specialize in highly virulent viral human and animal pathogens, biodefense, bioengagement in the BMENA region and NIS countries, and biological arms control.” Beyond establishing additional ties between Fauci’s NIAID and the Wuhan Institute of Virology – including multiple conferences involving scientists from both entities – the journal has also discussed gain-of-function research. These unearthed connections follow Fauci insisting his agency never participated in gain of function research at the Chinese lab during an exchange with Senator Rand Paul. A 2017 article from Virologica Sinica notes: “To identify the DENV entry factors, Amara’s group carried out a gain-of-function complementary DNA(cDNA) screen for host proteins that allow the minimally susceptible cell line 293T to be infectable by DENV (Carnec et al., 2015)” “Simultaneous gain-of-function and loss-offunction assays were performed by transfecting cells with or without related miRNA inhibitors. After 24 h, Act-D was added into the culture medium,” one study notes. Another study references the practice, commenting “two main approaches can be undertaken in such screens: gain-of-function, in which a library of overexpressed proteins is used in order to induce or amplify restriction.”"
"Papers Please: Oregon Becomes First Stasi State, Vax Pass Police Will Check Before Entry",21 MAY 2021,5006,"In Oregon, and in one California county, citizens are now required to show their papers before being allowed in businesses and workplaces without a mask. Conservative Treehouse reported: Some said it wasn’t legal, others said private companies and businesses would not do it, well, regardless of legality – Oregon is doing it: OREGON – Oregon has lifted its mask mandate for people who have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, but is requiring businesses, workplaces and houses of worship to verify the vaccination status of individuals before they enter buildings without a mask. This statewide mandate, one of the first of its kind in the country, raised concerns that the procedure of verifying vaccinations could be too cumbersome for workers. […] The Oregon Health Authority said in new guidance on Tuesday that effective immediately, businesses would be required to continue to enforce mask requirements unless they had established a policy to confirm proof of vaccination using a card or photo of one before individuals can enter the building without a mask. Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, said last week that Oregonians who were fully vaccinated no longer needed to wear masks in most public settings, except in places like schools, public transit and health care settings. But she quickly noted that businesses would have “the option” of lifting mask requirements only if they instituted verification. “Some businesses may prefer to simply continue operating under the current guidance for now rather than worrying about vaccination status, and that’s fine,” she said. (read more) The Gateway Pundit added: Oregon has gone from a liberal hell hole to 1930s Germany overnight. The Oregon Health Authority is now requiring businesses and religious institutions to enforce mask mandates by forcing people to show proof of vaccination. The CDC last week updated its mask guidance and said fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks indoors. In order to prevent the unvaccinated from walking around unmasked, Oregon health officials are now creating a caste system by marking the unvaxxed lepers. “Businesses, employers and faith institutions now have the option to adjust their masking guidance to allow fully vaccinated individuals to no longer wear a mask in their establishments,” OHA’s website said. “Businesses, employers and faith institutions doing so must have a policy in place to check the vaccination status of all individuals before they enter their establishment. Businesses, employers and faith institutions who do not create such policies will maintain the same masking guidance listed below, regardless of an individual’s vaccination status.” The Gateway Pundit reported: Businesses in Santa Clara County, California are required to submit vaccination status of all employees. According to the county’s public health order, “All businesses and government entities must ascertain the vaccination status of personnel and must comply with the rules for personnel who are not fully vaccinated, as required under section 9(c) and 9(d) of the County Health Officer’s May 18, 2021 Order.” Under the health order, the employee can decline to provide their vaccination status to their employer. If the employee declines to offer the information, the employer “should assume the employee may be unvaccinated and follow State and local requirements for unvaccinated employees.” In other words, if an employee refuses to get the vaccine or declines to disclose this private information to their employer, they will be treated like a second class citizen and will be forced to wear a face mask. The employers are not required to provide the vaccine information to the County, but they are required to collect it and “have it available to demonstrate their compliance with this requirement” (struggle session). The health order argues that HIPPA does not apply when an employer asks an employee for their vaccination status. “No. HIPAA applies to certain entities, such as healthcare providers and health plans, and what protected health information they can share about their patients or members under what circumstances. HIPAA does not govern what information employers may request from their employees.” – the health order read. It gets worse… Employees are told to document and snitch on fellow co-workers if they won’t tell fellow colleagues whether they are vaccinated – then treat them like dirty virus bags and stay away from them. “You must document that the worker declined to disclose his or her vaccination status, assume that they are not fully vaccinated, and follow all the rules that apply to workers who are not fully vaccinated.” the order said. The deadline for determining the vaccination status of workers is June 1, 2021, however employers are instructed to harass employees who have declined to disclose their vaccination status every 14 days. The employers must ask employees every 14 days what their vaccination status is so they can update their records."
Communist Professor Declares US “Defeated” In Biological War Against China,20 MAY 2021,3841,"If you have any doubt that the China virus, aka COVID 19, was a biological weapon used to destroy the U.S., take a look at what this communist professor has to say. Summit News reported: A professor with close ties to the Communist Chinese Government has declared that his country ‘defeated’ the U.S. in 2020, winning a biological war, and putting America ‘back in it’s place’. The comments were made by Chen Ping, a Senior Researcher at The China Institute of Fudan University, a CCP affiliated think tank, and a professor at Peking University. The video, which appeared online recently, was translated by New York-based Chinese blogger Jennifer Zeng. Zeng writes that the researcher claims “the Western model has failed, the 500-year maritime civilization is doomed, the CCP has won and ‘will lead the way of the modernization in the new era after the biology revolution’ after the 2020 CCPVirus (COVID19) pandemic.” Ping states in the video that “In 2020, China won the trade war, science and technology war, and especially the biological war.” “The achievement is unprecedented. This is an epoch-making historical record,” he continues, adding “So for the liberal, America-worshiping cult within China, their worship of the U.S. is actually unfounded.” “After this trade war and biological warfare, the U.S. was beaten back to its original shape,” Ping emphasised. Ping also commented on the 2020 U.S. election, noting “I think Trump’s attempt to restore the declining international status of the U.S. during his 4 years has failed. This failure is not only the failure of Trump’s personal campaign for re-election as president, but also the failure of the neo-liberalism-led globalization of the past four decades led by the U.S. and the UK.” “Therefore, the development and modernization model of the U.S. and Europe is not worthy of China’s imitation and repetition,” Ping added. China’s economy has expanded by 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year, marking the biggest increase since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992. The country has undoubtedly been able to rebound quickly by getting ahead of the pandemic in late 2019, stalling and obscuring the facts of what was unfolding while a criminally compliant World Health Organisation parroted CCP talking points to the rest of the world. With Trump out of office, America is now at the mercy of the Communist state, with Joe Biden having a long track record of selling out American industry to Chinese investors. As we recently reported, a group of the world’s leading scientists have urged more investigation into the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic was caused by a leak from Wuhan’s Institute of Virology, saying that the World Health Organisation has dismissed the notion without proper consideration. Meanwhile, GOP representatives on the House Intelligence Committee have demanded an update from the White House and the Director of National Intelligence on the possibility that the coronavirus leaked from the lab. The Republicans, led by Ranking Member Devin Nunes also want access to any intelligence on the “gain of function” research that was undertaken at the Wuhan lab in conjunction with US agencies. As we reported earlier in the year, top US National Security officials have indicated that they believe the most credible theory on the origin of COVID-19 is that it escaped from the Chinese laboratory.

"Biden Threatens To Run Over Reporter, Hysterical Laughter Follows",20 MAY 2021,3290,"Apparently, resident Biden gets passes for stealing, lying, and now, threatening murder. The Gateway Pundit reported: Earlier today The Gateway Pundit posted a video of Joe Biden pretending to drive an electric truck at a Ford facility. Following his speech, the declining septuagenarian was put in an electric vehicle where he pretended to be driving.
This was all a show by his handlers to make Joe Biden look like he’s in charge. Joe wasn’t driving. Let’s face it — Would you want to sit in a car with Joe Biden behind the wheel? Notice at the end that Joe Biden is turning the wheel to the right but the car is not turning.
It was all a stunt. Watch all the way to the end! Later today we received this email from a far-left USA Today “fact-checker” who is paid to harass conservative publications. Liberal outlets that lie for years about dossiers and Trump’s non-existent ties to Russia are never attacked by these far-left outlets. Hello, I’m Chiara Vercellone, a fact check reporter with USA TODAY. I’m emailing you because we’ve come across the article published by Gateway Pundit which claims Biden was not, in fact, driving the Ford F-150 electric truck earlier this week. I’ve read your article and I see that you mention the model Biden was driving has two steering wheels. Where did you get that information from? Did Ford confirm that with you? I also wanted to ask you if you could elaborate on the tone and motivation to write the article. We are writing a fact check on this and will be publishing this week. Thank you in advance. Best,
Chiara So now the far-left is gaslighting you into believing you did not see what you just witnessed with your own eyes! Here is our response to Chiara Vercellone — please note that this is a regular occurrence for conservative publications.: Hi Chiara, We also have some questions for you as well. Did you watch the entire video in our post and/or view the photos?
Did you see the second person in the passenger seat with his hands on that wheel?
Did you see when Joe Biden moved the steering wheel yet the car is not moving in that direction? And what is your motivation in asking TGP these questions?
What are you trying to assess from your questions? Have you confirmed with Ford on the record their statement? Do you believe Joe Biden is fit enough to drive a car or truck?
Would you ride in a car with Joe Biden driving you? Did you watch his speech on Tuesday? Did you count how many times he got lost in his own words?
Have you reported on his mental decline? Have you reported on his dementia?
Or is your organization protecting Joe Biden?
Why do you continue to hide the truth from the American public? We will also be doing a follow-up story including your email… Could you please provide some additional information? What is the tone and motivation of your questions?
Can you elaborate on your motivation for this fact check?
What conclusions are you trying to affirm through your questioning? Thank you,

Scottsdale School Board Tyranny! Parents Revolt As Fascists Sneak Away,20 MAY 2021,4518,"School boards across the country attract mini-dictators who believe that they are ‘shaping’ the thoughts of the next generation toward ‘enlightenment.’ But, in Scottsdale, parents have had enough of the elitist attitude and tyrannical control. Conservative Treehouse explained: It will take action, solid and unrelenting confrontational action, at the local level – to include ousting the leftist propagandists, before this insufferable control will end. Kudos to the parents who refused to back-down; now they need to remove these pontificating board members. “Whatever It Takes!” These people have no idea who they work for. In their elitist mindset they are operating above the citizens of their district. This type of leftist outlook must be removed from every school board in every district everywhere. It will take engagement by every patriotic parent, but it needs to happen with a sense of urgency. The district released a statement from Superintendent Dr. Scott A. Menzel: ARIZONA – The Scottsdale Unified School District Governing Board and I are disappointed that this evening’s regularly scheduled meeting had to be recessed because of non-compliance with district policy that visitors wear face masks at all times while on all district property. After 1) explaining the policy to the audience, which is the district’s authority to establish, 2) asking that attendees put on masks in order for the meeting to begin and 3) setting up an overflow room where those who did not wish to comply could watch the meeting virtually, the Board voted to recess the meeting until a future time. We understand that there are differing opinions on the need to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We fall on the side of doing what is within our authority to do in order to protect the safety and well-being of our students and staff. The district’s decision to maintain the mask policy through the end of the school year (May 27) was previously announced, as has the plan to make masks optional next fall. Most of our students are either not eligible or have not been vaccinated, and by following a careful mitigation strategy devised in concert with local, state and federal health agency guidelines and recommendations, we have been successful in preventing our schools from becoming COVID breeding grounds. As a result, we have been able to offer in-person learning opportunities to those students wanting and needing it since last fall. (read more) The Gateway Pundit added: Local Arizona patriot, Ka’rin Royster attended The Scottsdale Unified School District Board Meeting on Tuesday night where cowardly board members abandoned their post. Ka’rin arrived on the scene at 5:15 PM for the 6 PM meeting and there was already a line of angry parents out the door. About 100 or more people attended this hearing. Most of the parents were not wearing masks and the school board ordered them to put masks on before the meeting began. Parents refused to comply and they argued with the board for about 20 minutes. The board said that if one refuses to comply, they will be escorted out of the building. The parents stood their ground causing the board to adjourn the meeting and abandon their post. That’s when the parents started chanting, “COWARDS!” and “New Board!… New Board…” The school board was then escorted out of the room by 4 police officers. Instead of facing the taxpayers who demand answers, the board just left the room.
Who do they really answer to?
It’s obviously not their constituents. UPDATE– Danny Schayes sent more information on the meeting last night. The school board was pushing Critical Race Theory in the Scottsdale school system. From Danny Schayes — Leisa B. wanted me to forward this to you. Hopefully, you will be able to open it. As she mentioned, my wife Wendy is an Olympian and National Champion springboard diver. She is also a very concerned parent and patriot as is Leisa. The video clearly shows the school board person shutting down the meeting using the lame excuse of attendees not wearing masks. The meeting was to discuss teaching Critical Race Theory in the Scottsdale school system. Many parents were incensed as you can see. I am also attaching the flyer that was handed out by the parents’ group led by Amy Carney, whose husband Keith was a long-time NHL hockey player. Steve Bannon had a different video on the War Room broadcast sent by another parent but this one shows the events much more clearly. You can use this however you like or share if needed. WATCH:"
"Resident Biden Calls Coast Guard Class “Dull” For Not Clapping, Cites Mass Murdering Commie Dictator",20 MAY 2021,2337,"Resident Biden demonstrated his dementia and puppet status during an address to the Coast Guard graduating class. He called the group “dull” after they didn’t clap for him while he spouted citations from a mass-murdering dictator of the communist regime. Conservative Treehouse wrote: Two factual notes…. (1) Biden is a person of generally intemperate disposition. (2) The rank and file military do not like him. The installed White House occupant calls the graduating class of the Coast Guard “dull” after they do not clap for him. Nobody likes sleepy creepy Joe. The Gateway Pundit explained: Joe Biden delivered a commencement address at the US Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut on Wednesday. Biden got irritated at the lack of enthusiasm from the coast guard cadets and asked them to clap. Idiot Joe tried to crack a joke and got peeved at the lack of response from the crowd. “You are a really dull class. Come on, man! Is the sun getting to you?” Biden said with the sun beating down on his face. “I would think you’d have an opportunity when I say that about the Navy to clap — but to be here together …” he said. This isn’t the first time Joe Biden has snapped at our men in uniform. In 2016 Joe Biden called US troops “stupid bastards” to their face during a speech. The Gateway Pundit added: Joe Biden delivered a commencement address at the US Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut on Wednesday. After blasting the cadets for not clapping like seals, Joe Biden cited mass murderer Mao Tse Tung to inspire the young men. Mao Tse Tung, a Communist dictator, murdered up to 70 to 80 million Chinese last century, according to most accounts. Biden bragged about promoting women to leadership roles in the US military when he dropped his favorite quote from Mao ‘women hold up half the sky.’ “There’s a saying that we use in a different context, a Chinese saying that says, ‘Women hold up half the world.’ It’s an absolutely stupid position not to make sure they represent at least half of what we do,” said Biden. How inspiring! This isn’t the first time Joe Biden has cited Mao Tse Tung. Last summer Joe Biden cited Mao during a digital fundraising speech with Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett. “We’ve got to get real economic relief into women’s hands now,” Biden said last July. “Women hold up half the sky.”"
"Biden Threatens Unvaccinated Will Be “Paying the Price,” As Reporter Whines Ending Mandate Is Racist",18 MAY 2021,4496,"Resident Biden threatened unvaccinated Americans yesterday, and during the same ‘press conference’ a PBS reporter whined that removing mask mandates is somehow racist. The Gateway Pundit reported: Morbidly obese White House reporter, Yamiche Alcindor urged the Biden Admin to put pressure on the CDC to reverse the updated mask guidance. In March, the CDC is finally admitted what we’ve known all along: the overwhelming majority of people who were hospitalized or died from Covid were obese or overweight. “As clinicians develop care plans for COVID-19 patients, they should consider the risk for severe outcomes in patients with higher BMIs, especially for those with severe obesity,” the agency wrote. Last Thursday the CDC updated its guidance on masks and said fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks indoors. This greatly upset the morbidly obese and Covid cultists who are suffering from a myriad of severe mental illnesses. The hypochondriacs suffering from a fear of breathing fresh air, want to cling to their masks and they want everyone else to wear masks too. Yamichie Alcindor (who wasn’t wearing a mask during the White House briefing) also made mask-wearing about race, because why not?

Biden continued his war on people who choose not to take the experimental Covid jab and said the unvaccinated are a danger to others. This type of dehumanization is very dangerous and should be condemned. “If the unvaccinated get vaccinated, they will protect themselves and other unvaccinated people around them. If they do not, states with low vaccination rates may see those rates go up – may see this progress reversed,” said Biden. “Those who are not vaccinated will end up paying the price,” Biden added. Is this a threat? We know that Covid-19 convalescent individuals (people naturally infected with Covid) have the T cell immunity to the variants as well, but the Biden Admin is waging a war on people who choose not to get the Covid jab.

Yes, really. Last week, the CDC disappointed face diaper extremists by lifting restrictions on mask wearing in numerous settings. This prompted a massive backlash from those who have adopted the face covering as a kind of cult symbol, with a PBS journalist attempting to argue that not masking up will lead to the deaths of more black people. “The CDC guidelines on masks is putting front line workers and especially people of color at risk and they’re calling for the CDC to reverse that, what’s the White House’s stance on…people of color (being) at risk,” said the journalist. Leftists continue to be infuriated that mask mandates are ending because for the past year, they’ve been able to use them as a justification to ostracize and publicly shame conservatives, while the entire time claiming masks “aren’t political.” Despite the CDC’s advice, authorities throughout liberal states are refusing to fully lift the mandates while zealots like AOC are insisting they will continue to mask up. Meanwhile, two months after lifting its mask mandate, Texas recorded zero COVID deaths, the first time that has happened since data began to be collected. Even after the pandemic ends, those who have cemented mask wearing as a signal of virtue, compliance and political obedience will fight tooth and nail to keep the mandates in place under any flimsy justification. Today Texas reported: * 0 Covid related deaths–the only time that's happened since data was tracked in March, 2020. * the fewest Covid cases in over 13 months * the lowest 7-day Covid positivity rate ever * the lowest Covid hospitalizations in 11 months.

"CDC Director Admits Trump Was Right, COVID Cases ‘Hugely’ Overcounted In Great Lie",18 MAY 2021,2217,"The CDC admitted that COVID numbers were hugely exaggerated. The Gateway Pundit reported: In August 2020 The Gateway Pundit’s Joe Hoft posted an article about COVID-19 that sent shockwaves throughout the internet — The CDC website admitted that only around 6% of COVID recorded deaths were due entirely to the Coronavirus- SHOCK REPORT: This Week CDC Quietly Updated COVID-19 Numbers – Only 9,210 Americans Died From COVID-19 Alone – Rest Had Different Other Serious Illnesses The gist of the report was that COVID-19 is not nearly as deadly as first projected by the WHO and then by Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Debra Birx.  Based on CDC numbers in Ausust  only 6% of all deaths attributed to COVID-19 were instances where the only factor in the individual’s death was due to COVI9-19. From the CDC website. For all the other deaths reported by the CDC linked to COVID-19, the individuals who passed away had 2-3 other serious illnesses or co-morbidities. This came from actual data from the CDC and was tweeted by Mel Q on Twitter. Twitter user Mel Q shared a calculation which showed that 6% of all COVID-19 deaths as reported by the CDC turned out to be 9,201 deaths at the time.  Only 9,201 people died in the US according to August numbers where COVID-19 was the only cause of death. We used Mel Q’s tweet in our report and the President of the United States retweeted Mel Q’s tweet as well. But  Twitter took down the tweet claiming fake news.  They notified Mel Q that the tweet that used actual CDC data “violated their policy on misleading information about COVID-19.”  Her account was suspended from posting for 12 hours. Then the far left hacks at CNN wrote an article about this calculation, the President’s retweet and our article entitled – Twitter removes QAnon supporter’s false claim about coronavirus death statistics that Trump had retweeted. They refused to look at the science. On Sunday CDC Director Rochelle Walensky finally admitted that “many, many hospitals” were counting COVID deaths to include cases that were not COVID deaths. The Gateway Pundit was right.
Trump was right.

Fauci Busted! Logs Show Coordinated WH Meeting After ‘Gain of Function’ Stopped,18 MAY 2021,8136,"Anthony Fauci is a congenital liar who has spread Chinese propaganda and controlled the country for nearly two years. His latest lie has been exposed by White House logs, that show he arranged a meeting concerning the gain of function studies (like those that generated COVID 19) moratorium, the same gain of function studies he said were never directly funded by his government agency (NIC). The National Pulse explained: A National Pulse review of White House Visitor Logs from November 2014 reveals a meeting in the White House Situation Room, chaired by then-Ebola Czar Ron Klain. The meeting appears to have been coordinated by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and included several high-level U.S. government agency heads. The high profile summit came just weeks after the Obama administration issued a moratorium on the same “gain of function” experiments that Dr. Fauci now claims were never directly funded by his government agency to take place at the Wuhan lab in China. Fauci’s insistence, however, is betrayed by a new analysis of the sequence of events and examples of his own staff headlining gain of function events in Wuhan. President Obama and other senior White House officials – potentially including then-Vice President Joe Biden – may also have been present. The Situation Room Summit, 2014. On the morning of November 17th, 2014, Dr. Anthony Fauci made his way to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), otherwise known as the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB). The meeting was confirmed in the White House logs by Department for Homeland Security administrator Drew Cramer. At 10am, he met with the man who would become known 7 years later as Joe Biden’s “prime minister,” Ron Klain. Four others joined Dr. Fauci, including former Walmart executive-turned-Health and Human Services staffer Leslie Dach. David J Horowitz, who headed the legal side of the Ebola crisis; the Center for Disease Control’s Mitchell Wolfe; and the founding director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Robin Robinson, were all present. BARDA is described as being “responsible for the procurement and development of medical countermeasures, principally against bioterrorism, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats, as well as pandemic influenza and emerging diseases.” Included on the roster for the Situation Room were then Centers for Disease Control Director Thomas Frieden and Rear Admiral Stephen Redd of the U.S. Public Health Service. In other words: a top team discussion. Visiting government officials are, as a matter of routine, noted in the official records. White House employees, including the President and Vice President, are never logged in this manner. But the summit was clearly an important one, and appears to have prompted a subsequent discussion later that day in the White House Situation Room, suggesting the involvement of President Obama, or at least then-Vice President Joe Biden. A new appointment was made on November 17th for later that day, as the above graphic reveals. Infectious Diseases. Less than a week before the Situation Room summit, President Obama had declared a new vision for the United States and China in the arena of infectious diseases. A now archived “Fact Sheet” reads: The United States expresses appreciation for China’s approximately $130 million in contributions to the international Ebola response.  The United States and China are working together to provide needed equipment, supplies, and treatment facilities in Liberia, and our health personnel are working side-by-side to address the Ebola epidemic at its source.  The two sides call on all members of the international community to step up their efforts in support of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Together, the United States and China are committed to working jointly with partners through the Global Health Security Agenda to develop long-term capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases. Just ahead of the Obama-Xi agreement, Fauci ushered two additional groups into Rooms 230 and 210 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (OEOB) to meet Klain. The dates of these meetings were November 6th and 10th, 2014. These details may go some way to helping uncover the truth behind the National Institute for Health (NIH) and its alleged funding of gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The information puts Klain and Obama at the head of the table for the decision to green-light what Fauci has been ferociously denying as of late. Tony and Ron. Dr. Fauci and Ron Klain would go on to enjoy a close, working relationship, and these meetings underscore their collaboration on the future of U.S.-CCP collaborative research. Critics may also suggested Dr. Fauci had a political conflict of interest when advising President Trump in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. His own party affiliation and his family’s donation history seem to confirm this. One challenge they faced was to craft a more robust public relations campaign to counter growing media criticism of Obama’s lame Ebola response, the worst of it coming as a result of Donald Trump’s tweets. As a political operative, Klain was an unusual pick as Ebola Czar. But he was effective. A Joe Biden loyalist, he did one thing fabulously well, he made Dr. Fauci a media darling and began reversing the Obama administration’s public relations misfortunes on their handling of the matter. Two days after Klain’s appointment to the role on October 17, 2014, Fauci appeared on every television network’s Sunday show to tamp down criticism of the Klain as an Ebola czar. And it worked well for both men. For Fauci, multiple meetings with Obama would soon follow, including a high-profile hug-fest in the Oval Office on October 24, 2014, in which Fauci introduced Ebola survivor Nina Pham to Obama. The media was enthralled with the “Tony Fauci Healthcare Hero” narrative. A few years later, Pham sued her employer – Texas Health Resources – and slammed a video featuring her and her doctors as “a public relations stunt and an invasion of privacy.” Denial over Wuhan. Fauci and Klain were on the same page in their early assessments of the outbreak in Wuhan. In a January 21, 2020 interview with Greg Kelly on Newsmax, Fauci said: “This is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States should be worried about right now.” This was followed by several more weeks of obfuscations and contradictions. Coming in behind Fauci’s bewildering and unhelpful advice was Ron Klain’s own public statements, such as those made on January 30th 2020, in article in The Atlantic. The piece by Klain opened with Chinese Communist Party talking points, and went on to parrot Fauci’s downplaying of the virus while more hawkish types such as Steve Bannon and Dr. Peter Navarro banged the drum for immediate action. “We do not know yet how grave a threat the new coronavirus will turn out to be. On the one hand, scientists have quickly sequenced the virus and are working on a vaccine. China has imposed draconian quarantines to slow the virus’s spread, and is rapidly building massive new hospitals to treat its victims. To date, the U.S. has seen only a handful of cases, all of them the product of travel to China, not transmission here. These are causes for concern, but not overwrought fear,” Klain wrote. He added: “Ultimately, the question may never be called on the coronavirus, which could be less of a threat than early indications suggest…” His conclusion needs no explainer: “Five presidents—liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans—have looked to Tony Fauci for advice; it is not impossible to imagine Trump being the first to angrily dismiss the counsel he offers if it does not fit with his own poor instincts.” Trump, in fact, heeded Fauci – to his and the world’s detriment. Now the world needs to know what was discussed in these critical 2014 meetings, and how Fauci and Klain’s relationship progressed through to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Arizona Senate Demands Supervisors Answer for Deletion, Trump Weighs In",14 MAY 2021,11079,"In Arizona, after evidence showed that the election information was deliberately deleted after a court order, the Senate demanded answers. Conservative Treehouse reported: A few rather interesting developments in the Maricopa County, Arizona, ballot audit might begin to paint a picture of what possibly took place. Let’s start with a letter sent by Senate President Karen Fann to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. Make sure you read the full letter. Here is where it gets interesting. Let’s focus on the “database directory” that was found to have been deleted by the auditors.  Pay attention to the dates ‘CREATED’ and the size of the ballot file size ‘bytes’: What are the odds the 2020 Democrat Presidential Primary Election file created 3/25/2020 would be the exact same size as the audited 2/3/2021 General election file? Pres Primary file created 3/25/2020 8,388,608 bytes General Election file created 2/3/2021 8,388,608 bytes Notice the date this General Election file was created corresponds with the Maricopa Board of Supervisors being under pressure and holding a BOS vote on whether to audit the Maricopa County ballot results in an attempt to stop further public inquiry into potential misconduct.  See this article link: [Thursday January 27th, 2021] –  “The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors will vote Wednesday on whether to conduct another audit on the county voting system in an attempt to placate any concerns of voter fraud or election misconduct during the 2020 general election. The public can watch at 9:30 a.m. as the board considers an item at its public meeting that proposes “hiring two independent, qualified firms to independently audit tabulation hardware and software in a way that protects private voter information and our investment in the machines,” according to a statement from Chairman Jack Sellers.” The article was written Wed Jan 26th, revised Thur Jan 27th.  The “will vote Wednesday” is February 3rd, the same day the file was accessed.  On that February 3rd date, the Arizona State Senate voted to hold the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in contempt.  See this article link: [February 3, 2021] – All 16 Republicans in the Arizona Senate co-sponsored a resolution calling for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to be held in contempt and arrested for refusing to comply with wide-ranging subpoenas for election equipment and materials. Senate Resolution 1005 directs Senate President Karen Fann to “take all legal action pursuant to section 41-1153” of state law, which says that any “witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to a subpoena may be arrested by the sergeant-at-arms and brought before the senate or house.”  What this all means is yet to be determined; however, there is a general outline starting to emerge.  Consider this scenario…. We know the 2020 Democrat President Primary was eventually coordinated by party officials, the DNC, and the Obama network to put Joe Biden into place right before the 2020 South Carolina primary: “Right before the SC Primary the DNC Club knew they had a problem with the Bernie Sanders momentum.  An urgent assembly of all party control officers was called. The DNC Club designed a plan around using James Clyburn as the official spark for Joe Biden to take back control of the primary outcome. Former President Obama was initiated by the Club to contact all candidates and inform them when and how they would quit the race and fall-in-line behind Joe Biden.  Clyburn was then triggered to initiate his endorsement and begin the rapid-fire process. Within 48 hours all members of the club and candidates had their instructions and proceeded to follow-through on the plan.  They had no choice.  If they did not comply they would suffer the consequences of a fully aligned club hierarchy who would target them personally and financially.  The plan worked flawlessly. As part of the coordinated deal Representative James Clyburn was put in charge of the Biden campaign; Clyburn stunningly admitted this immediately after the strategy went public.” Could it be that Maricopa County ballots (files) from the 2020 primary were used in the electronic tabulation machines as files to enhance the 2021 general election?   If so, that would imply this strategy to manipulate the tabulation machines was in place for quite a long time prior to the November 2020 election. We’ll have to wait and see how this plays out.  What we know right now is the Arizona State Senate no longer wants background conversations with county officials; instead wants the Maricopa county board of supervisors to appear for public hearings where the content and discussion are visible for everyone to see. Interesting…. The Gateway Pundit explained: President Trump on Thursday released a new statement on the ‘deleted database’ and voting irregularities uncovered in the Maricopa election audit. Wednesday afternoon, it was discovered that “the entire database” for the 2020 General election in Maricopa, showing the “Results Tally and Reporting,” has been deleted! Maricopa County Supervisor Chairman Jack Sellers received a letter from Arizona Senate President Karen Fann demanding answers: “We have recently discovered that the entire “Database” directory from the D drive of the machine “EMSPrimary” has been deleted. This removes election-related details that appear to have been covered by the subpoena. In addition, the main database for the Election Management System (EMS) Software, “Results Tally and Reporting,” is not located anywhere on the EMSPrimary machine, even though all of the EMS Clients reference that machine as the location of the database. This suggests that the main database for all election-related data for the November 2020 General Election has been removed. Can you please advise as to why these folders were deleted, and whether there are any backups that may contain the deleted folders?” the letter stated. President Trump released a statement on the irregularities uncovered and said the 2020 election was a “corrupt, third-world election.” President Trump reacts to AZ Sen. Karen Fann's letter on the @ArizonaAudit:https://t.co/4mPuUu1kC4 pic.twitter.com/Juu6WZre1q — Natalie Harp (@NatalieJHarp) May 13, 2021 Breitbart News added: The president of the Arizona State Senate asked the chairman of the Maricopa Board of Supervisors in a letter on Tuesday to address “three serious issues that have arisen in the course of the Senate’s ongoing audit of the returns of the November 3, 2020, general election in Maricopa County. “ Arizona State Senate President Karen Fann identified those three issues in her letter to Maricopa County Supervisors Board Chairman Jack Sellers as: (1) ongoing non-compliance with legislative subpoenas, (2) chain of custody, and ballot organization anomalies, and (3) deleted databases. As Breitbart News reported on December 16: Arizona Senate Republicans on Tuesday issued subpoenas to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors for a scanned ballot audit and ‘full forensic audit of ballot tabulation equipment, the software for that equipment and the election management system used in the 2020 general election.’ The audit of Maricopa County’s November 2020 election results began on April 23 and may continue into the summer. “The first issue concerns Maricopa County’s apparent intent to renege on its previous commitment to comply fully with the legislative subpoenas issued on January 13, 2021, which, as you know, Judge Thomason found were valid and enforceable,” Fann wrote in Tuesday’s letter, adding: To date, attorneys for Maricopa County have refused to produce virtual images of routers used in connection with the general election, relying on a conclusory and unsupported assertion that providing the routers would somehow “endanger the lives of law enforcement officers, their operations, or the protected health information and personal data of Maricopa County’s citizens.” . . . Nevertheless, in an effort to resolve the dispute regarding production of the routers, we propose that agents of CyFIR, an experienced digital forensics firm and subcontractor of Cyber Ninjas, review virtual images of the relevant routers in Maricopa County facilities and in the presence of representatives of the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office. Fann then addressed the second issue, chain of custody and ballot organization anomolies: As the audit has progressed, the Senate’s contractors have become aware of apparent omissions, inconsistencies, and anomalies relating to Maricopa County’s handling, organization, and storage of ballots. We hope you can assist us in understanding these issues, including specifically the following: The County has not provided any chain-of-custody documentation for the ballots. Does such documentation exist, and if so, will it be produced? The bags in which the ballots were stored are not sealed, although the audit team has found at the bottom of many boxes cut seals of the type that would have sealed a ballot bag. Why were these seals placed at the bottom of the boxes? Batches within a box are frequently separated by only a divider without any indication of the corresponding batch numbers. In some cases, the batch dividers are missing altogether.  This lack of organization has significantly complicated and delayed the audit team’s ballot processing efforts.  What are the County’s procedures for sorting, organizing, and packaging ballot batches? Most of the ballot boxes were sealed merely with regular tape and not secured by any kind of tamper-evident seal. Is that the County’s customary practice for storing ballots? The audit team has encountered a significant number of instances in which there is a disparity between the actual number of ballots contained in a batch and the total denoted on the pink report slip accompanying the batch. In most of these instances, the total on the pink report slip is greater than the number of ballots in the batch, although there are a few instances in which the total is lower.  What are the reasons for these discrepancies? Fann then addressed the issue of deleted data bases: We have recently discovered that the entire “Database” directory from the D drive of the machine “EMSPrimary” has been deleted. This removes election related details that appear to have been covered by the subpoena. In addition, the main database for the Election Management System (EMS) Software, “Results Tally and Reporting,” is not located anywhere on the EMSPrimary machine, even though all of the EMS Clients reference that machine as the location of the database. This suggests that the main database for all election related data for the November 2020 General Election has been removed. Can you please advise as to why these folders were deleted, and whether there are any backups that may contain the deleted folders? Fann closed by inviting Board Chair Sellers and appropriate Maricopa County employees to meet with her personally at a hearing room in the Arizona State Capital on Tuesday, May 18 to address these three serious issues."
"Dominion Announces It Is Above The Law, Democrats Mock Audit Evidence",14 MAY 2021,2568,"This is just nauseating. The Gateway Pundit reported: Dominion Voting Systems released a very revealing statement on Thursday. The Denver-based company responded to the Arizona Senate’s demand for passwords to ballot tabulators. Back on November 30, 2020, Maricopa County elections witness Jan Bryant testified before the Arizona legislature. Jan said back on November 30, 2020, that Maricopa County officials DID NOT RUN THE ELECTION! Two Dominion employees in the audit center ran the election. This explains why Maricopa County officials do not have Admin passwords or access to the Dominion voting machines. They never had them! America’s Audit Director Ken Bennett told OAN earlier in the week that Dominion was refusing to comply with the subpoena to turn over the passwords. What are they hiding? In their statement published today Dominion attacked the forensic auditing team performing the audit. Dominion defended the controversial EAC group that rubber-stamped the previous counting of ballots. And Dominion then said they will not release the passwords to the Maricopa County voting machines.
They will NOT ALLOW any auditors to look at their machines. This is very telling. What are they afraid of?

"Smoking Gun In AZ! Election Officials Deleted Entire Database, Including “All Election Information”",13 MAY 2021,5308,"The Arizona audit just exploded in the faces of the lying, cheating, stealing democrats. And even Rasmussen is being forced to report it. The Gateway Pundit reported: Last week, the Gateway Pundit reported about the emergency meeting that was called by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, after the County was reportedly unable to provide passwords to the auditors performing an audit of the county’s 2020 Election results. They also did not provide access to the routers which were requested in the audit as well. This afternoon, it was discovered that “the entire database” for the 2020 General election, showing the “Results Tally and Reporting,” has been deleted! 100 Percent Fed Up reports– President of the Arizona Senate Karen Fann has written a letter to Chairman Sellers, demanding answers. Here is the letter to Maricopa County Supervisor Chairman Jack Sellers from Arizona Senate President Karen Fann: Dear Chairman Sellers: I am writing to seek your assistance and cooperation in the resolution of three (3) serious issues that have arisen in the course of the Senate’s ongoing audit of the returns of the November 3, 2020, general election in Maricopa County. I. Ongoing Non-Compliance with the Legislative Subpoenas The first issue concerns Maricopa County’s apparent intent to renege on its previous commitment to comply fully with the legislative subpoenas issued on January 13, 2021, which, as you know, Judge Thomason found were valid and enforceable. Nevertheless, in an effort to resolve the dispute regarding production of the routers, we propose that agents of CyFIR, an experienced digital forensics firm and subcontractor of Cyber Ninjas, review virtual images of the relevant routers in Maricopa County facilities and in the presence of representatives of the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office. Such an arrangement would permit Maricopa County to retain custody and monitor the review of router data while ensuring that the Senate may access the information it requires—and to which it is constitutionally entitled—to successfully complete its audit. The Senate has no interest in viewing or taking possession of any information that is unrelated to the administration of the 2020 general election. II. Chain of Custody and Ballot Organization Anomalies As the audit has progressed, the Senate’s contractors have become aware of apparent omissions, inconsistencies, and anomalies relating to Maricopa County’s handling, organization, and storage of ballots.We hope you can assist us in understanding these issues, including specifically the following: For your convenience, images of the corresponding pink report slips are attached in Exhibit A. The image below shows the location of the files known to be deleted. In addition, the main database for “Results Tally and Reporting” is not present. I am hopeful that we can constructively resolve these issues and questions without recourse to additional subpoenas or other compulsory processes.To that end, I invite you and any other officers or employees of Maricopa County (to include officials in the Elections Department) who possess knowledge or information concerning the matters set forth above to a meeting at the Arizona State Capitol on Tuesday, May 18, 2021, at 1:00 p.m. in Hearing Room 109. Chairman Petersen, former Secretary Bennett, and I will attend the meeting, which will be live-streamed to the public. Please let me know at your earliest convenience whether you accept my invitation and, if so, which Maricopa County personnel will attend. Thank you for your cooperation on these important issues of public concern. Respectfully, Karen Fann, President Arizona State Senate When inspectors received the boxes of ballots where the audit was being performed, the tamper-proof tape was cut on the boxes and the number of ballots inside the boxes was not the same as what was reported by the County reporter, and what was turned over to the Senate don’t line up.

Rand Paul Gets Fauci To Commit Crime: Wuhan Paper Proves False Testimony,12 MAY 2021,4272,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is one of the dirtiest deep state actors ever. His connections to vaccine manufacturers make his decisions suspect, at the least, but his connection to the funding of the Wuhan Lab makes his actions criminal, and now he’s been busted lying under oath. Conservative Treehouse explained: Senator Dr. Rand Paul calls-out the primary U.S. Engineer of COVID-19 chaos, Dr. Anthony Fauci, over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether or not the NIH has sent money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Dr. Fauci insists the National Institute of Health has not funded the Wuhan lab.  Senator Paul notes Fauci is parsing words because the NIH funds the research partnership between the U.S. lab and the Wuhan lab that creates, and created, the modified (ie. “gain of function”) COVID variants.  Sketchy Fauci is fraught with professional obfuscation in the form of ‘parseltongue’. WATCH: The Gateway Pundit reported: The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a hearing on the efforts to combat COVID-19 on Tuesday. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) ripped into Dr. Fauci on Tuesday about funding the Wuhan lab. Since May 2020, The Gateway Pundit has been reporting on Dr. Anthony Fauci’s likely illegal funding of coronavirus projects at the Wuhan Virology Center. It is clear that they successfully isolated the coronavirus in the lab and were actively experimenting with species-to-species transmission. It’s also important to note that back in 2017 we had solid intelligence about a viral leak in a high-security Chinese virology R&D center that resulted in the SARS virus getting out and killing people. In May 2020, TGP reported this: The leader of the US task force overseeing the country’s response to the China coronavirus, Dr. Tony Fauci, was the one who funded the Wuhan bat virus work and kept it going. Last month Washington Post columnist Josh Rogan said Fauci needs to provide answers about his involvement with the Wuhan lab. “Dr. Fauci and the National Institutes of Health were responsible for using taxpayer dollars for gain of function research, to weaponize viruses to make them more contagious and more deadly.” he said. Rand Paul confronted Fauci on Tuesday: “Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan?” Arrogant Fauci shot back at the Kentucky lawmaker: “Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the Wuhan institute.” Rand Paul would not back down and really got under Fauci’s skin!

"Israel Attacked, Temple Mount Fire Used for fake News As Rockets From Gaza Target School Children",11 MAY 2021,11166,"Yesterday, unprovoked rocket attacks carried out by terrorists against Israel (and deliberately targeting schools) cost lives in the Middle East. While the mainstream media wrung their hands at Israel’s response to the evil barrage of rockets and pushed lies about Israeli’s dancing in the streets, a fire raged on the Temple Mount and the world (thanks to a stolen election and communist control) went from prosperity and peace in the Middle East to gas lines and death in a little over 100 days. The Jerusalem Post reported: The coverage of the clashes in Jerusalem and the rocket fire that followed has focused disproportionately on Israel’s actions, either on the airstrikes that occurred or the threatened evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and clashes in al-Aqsa Mosque. This may not be surprising, but it also has helped frame the current conflict as largely a product of Israel’s alleged aggression, as opposed to a cycle set in motion partly by Hamas. The most anti-Israel coverage, unsurprisingly, is in the Iranian and Turkish media. Iran and Turkey both support Hamas. Turkey’s Anadolu Agency, a state-run news agency, has about a dozen stories on Israel, and each is more anti-Israel than the last. One says Israel has killed 24 civilians, and another says Israel arrested Arabs who protested in Jerusalem and reports about “Israeli attacks on al-Aqsa Mosque.” Ankara has stoked protests against Israeli diplomatic posts in Turkey, even though the regime has prevented other protests, such as the recent May Day ones. Turkey uses the COVID-19 pandemic to shut down all critics, but then it encourages anti-Israel protests, the flames being fanned by pro-government media. Turkey has vowed to “defend” the Palestinians. Anadolu also says its journalists were attacked in Jerusalem. Ankara has spoken to the Jordanian king and says Israeli forces are “storming al-Aqsa.” This is largely a fabricated story. The use of the expression “storming al-Aqsa” is used by anti-Israel voices who try to pretend that securing the Temple Mount against violent protesters is “storming.” In no other place in the world is securing a holy site “storming.” The Turkish Foreign Ministry claims that “many innocent civilians” have been killed in Gaza. Iranian media have also emphasized the “brutal repression” of Palestinians in “al-Quds,” the Press TV term used for Jerusalem. Al-Quds is also the Arabic and Islamic term, but for major media to replace the word Jerusalem with “Quds” illustrates an agenda that is about more than just terminology. “Palestinian resistance launched operation Al-Quds Sword as Israel kills 25 in Gaza raids,” is how Press TV says the events unfolded. This makes it seem like Hamas attacked Jerusalem with rockets in retaliation, when in fact the opposite happened. For CNN, the story is headlined: “Israel launches airstrikes after rockets fired from Gaza in day of escalation.” NBC says: “Jerusalem tensions boil over with rocket fire and at least 20 killed in Gaza.” This neatly captures a more accurate picture of what has transpired. There have been “pleas for calm as violence escalates,” says the BBC. The Guardian, however, sought to emphasize the “twenty-four dead in Gaza after Jerusalem violence spreads.” In most of the reports, the Palestinian rocket fire – targeting Jerusalem and aiming some 200 rockets at communities around Gaza – is emphasized. The discussions of the rocket fire were often put further down in the articles or were made to seem like retaliation for something Israel had done. “The rockets came on the anniversary of Israel’s capture of the Old City of Jerusalem and its eastern neighborhoods in the 1967 Six Day War,” NBC reported. “Explosions and air raid sirens were heard in Jerusalem after Hamas set a deadline for Israel to remove its security forces from flash points in Jerusalem and release Palestinians detained in the latest clashes.” The Independent in the UK said: “At least 24 people – including nine children – have been killed amid a new wave of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that continued throughout the night into Tuesday morning, the Palestinian health ministry has said. The youngest victim was 10 years old, Gaza health officials told The Independent. More than 700 Palestinians have been injured since the outbreak of violence in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, including around al-Aqsa Mosque compound.” It isn’t clear from the report that Hamas had fired any rockets until the reader gets past the first several paragraphs. The report made it appear Israel just carried out this “wave” of airstrikes, killing children, and then Hamas fired rockets. The report did note the UK had condemned the attack on Israel, however. In the US, Fox News said Gaza militants were killed as Israel “hits Hamas.” This seemed to be one of the rare headlines that put Hamas in the title, noting the actual perpetrator of incitement and attacks on Israel.
CBS wrote: “Israel hits Gaza after militants launch rocket attack.” That headline at least explained the timeline of how this recent conflict had unfolded. Prior to most of the coverage of the airstrikes, a lot of the spotlight has been on Sheikh Jarrah. On social media, many have posted a video without context showing Israelis cheering at the Western Wall on Jerusalem Day as a fire rages near al-Aqsa Mosque. The video is presented in such a way as to claim Israelis are cheering attacks on al-Aqsa, when in fact the context is very different. Scant coverage seems to have focused on the rioting in many places in Israel and the West Bank or Hamas incitement as part of the cycle. The Jerusalem Post added: A video clip showing Israeli celebrants marking Jerusalem Day by dancing and singing in the Kotel plaza Monday night while a tree is seen aflame on the Temple Mount has gone viral. The video captured a scene similar to those that Israelis have used to criticize Palestinians in the past – whether dancing on rooftops as Scud missiles landed on Tel Aviv buildings, or handing out sweets in Gaza following a successful Palestinian terror attack on Israelis. Critics wrote scathing posts of how they were dancing as the Temple Mount was burning. “Shocking,” tweeted Joint List MK Ayman Odeh in a post accompanied by the video. “This is a real scene from #Jerusalem today. Sorry, but the best description is: What a shit-show!” tweeted Haaretz reporter Noa Landau. However, other social media posts pointed out that the primarily young, white-shirted religious nationalists would have been celebrating the day 0 marking the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 – regardless of the fire. The juxtaposition of the dancing and the fire was inadvertent. Other tweets breathlessly claimed that the fire was the onset of Jews taking over control of the area and of the al-Aqsa compound on the Mount, the third-holiest site in Islam. According to the Jerusalem Police, the fire was started due to errant firecrackers thrown by Palestinians. The Foreign Ministry tweeted “A burning tree on the Temple Mount this evening, the result of violent protesters shooting fireworks at police.” The Jerusalem Post reported: One of the rockets struck a bus in Holon, just south of Tel Aviv, according to initial reports.Earlier in the day, two women were killed in Ashkelon on Tuesday as barrages of rockets struck the southern city and the IDF continued to target Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorist sites throughout the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the intensity and rate of attacks will increase following a visit to the IDF’s Southern Command headquarter. “We are in the midst of a campaign,” he said. “Since yesterday, the IDF has been attacking hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad sites in Gaza. We have neutralized commanders, we have hit many of their quality targets. Hamas will be struck in ways that it did not expect.” The Israelis were killed – one woman in her 60s and the other in her 80s – when rockets slammed into their homes in Ashkelon. Minutes later the IDF reported that it had killed two top PIJ commanders responsible for rocket fire in Gaza. One of the Palestinian terrorists killed was identified as Samah Abed al-Mamlouk. The IDF and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) said that he was attacked in a hideout together with a number of additional Islamic Jihad operatives. Mamlouk, the IDF said, was in charge of PIJ’s rocket arsenal. In another strike, Hassan Abu al-Atta, deputy commander of Islamic Jihad’s Gaza Brigade, was also killed when the IDF struck an apartment in an eight-story building in Gaza’s Rimal neighborhood. He was the brother of Baha abu Al-Ata who was killed in an Israeli targeted killing 2019. Earlier Tuesday, Defense Minister Benny Gantz approved the call-up of 5,000 reservists as the IDF prepared for a large-scale offensive in the Gaza Strip as rocket attacks against southern Israel continued. “For every day of shooting at the citizens of Israel – we will send [Hamas and PIJ] back years and hit them hard,” Gantz said at an operational assessment with Southern Command officers and heads of local municipalities in the South. “We will not stop until calm returns. We will not stop until we achieve long-term calm and severe damage to the terrorist infrastructure,” Gantz went on to say on IDF operations in the coming days. Gantz said Tuesday evening that he anticipates Hamas will make a “victory speech,” but that the reality is they will suffer a “very serious blow.” “We are less than a day since the start of the operation, carrying out a massive wave of attacks in a campaign that began in Jerusalem. We have embarked on a campaign that will hurt Hamas seriously.” The IDF struck over 130 targets throughout Gaza overnight Monday as southern Israel was bombarded by over 480 rockets since Monday afternoon, injuring over 90 Israelis. Approximately 150 failed rocket launches fell back into the Gaza Strip and Air Defense Artillery combat soldiers intercepted approximately 200 rockets. Shortly afterwards, a number of barrages of rockets were fired towards Ashdod and Ashkelon, with three residential buildings hit directly by rockets, leading to light injuries. Hamas took responsibility for the barrages, stating that the “Al-Qassam Brigades directed the largest missile strike so far on the occupied cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon, in response to the enemy’s continued targeting of houses and resistance men, and the next is greater, God willing.” As such, the IDF has deployed additional Iron Dome batteries to the southern Gush Dan region and has added an extra Iron Dome battery that had been in reserve. The 101st Battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade and the Egoz commando unit were called up to southern Israel and the 202nd Battalion was called up to the West Bank on Tuesday morning. An anti-tank guided missile also struck a civilian vehicle near Sderot, causing light injuries to the driver, who was just several meters from his vehicle. He was transferred to the hospital for medical treatment.

Biden War On Women Official: Sex Now Defined As “Non Biological”,11 MAY 2021,3407,"So, people are standing in lives for gasoline and unemployment handouts from the government, liberals can rest easy because at least while standing in line they can rest secure in the fact that the Department of Health and Human Services has approved delusional mental illnesses, stating that sex is ‘non-biological.’ The National Review reported: The Biden administration is reversing a rule initiated by former President Donald Trump that defined “sex” as biological, in an effort to prevent “discrimination” against transgender people in health care practices, the Department of Health and Human Services announced on Monday. The notice of enforcement, while not a binding federal rule, signals that the federal government will begin interpreting Section 1557 — the non-discrimination provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — to include a ban on discrimination based on sexual identity, rather than simply banning discrimination based on biological sex, as the Trump administration had. The change will likely require that states, which set their own Medicaid eligibility requirements, provide gender-reassignment surgery and hormone therapy to Medicaid recipients. “The Supreme Court has made clear that people have a right not to be discriminated against on the basis of sex and receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation (SOGI). That’s why today HHS announced it will act on related reports of discrimination,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement announcing the change. Many private insurers, such as Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield, and managed care organizations, such as United Healthcare, already cover transition surgeries and hormone therapy, and have an incentive to comply with the Biden administration’s definition of discrimination in order to avoid expensive litigation. Certain state governments, especially the Republican-dominated, may decide to fight the disputes in court for a number of reasons, including to control cost via a medical necessity determination and to prevent controversial medical procedures from being performed in the state. Republican states could face lawsuits over the issue via two avenues: Medicaid claim denial and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) claim. Since state governments are also employers, transgender employees could allege that their employer’s healthcare plan is discriminatory, and demand the court force coverage for gender identity medical treatment. For now, the notice allows exemptions for religiously-affiliated organizations to survive, in adherence to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and subsequent court rulings. This means hospitals and healthcare providers with religious objections will not be coerced to participate in transgender “transition” interventions by the Office of Civil Rights, the enforcement arm of HHS. However, The Equality Act pending in the Senate, which President Biden has agreed to sign, poses an existential threat to the RFRA protection in matters of gender identity, sexual orientation, and abortion. Soon after taking office, Biden signed Executive Order 13988, which tasked federal agencies with drafting plans to better enforce sexual orientation and gender identity rights by an April 30th deadline. The HHS regulatory guidance, released Monday, coincides closely with that stipulated deadline.  "
Texas Rancher’s Video Goes Viral As 5 Girls Abandoned By Human Smugglers,11 MAY 2021,2526,"In a viral video, a Texas rancher exposed the fact that thanks to the communist controllers installed in the White House, five tiny girls were abandoned on the Border without food, water or protection by human smugglers. Resident Biden’s ‘policies’ are subjecting children to horrific evils… but perhaps given his previous, catalogued behavior, hurting kids is okay with him. Breitbart News reported: A Texas rancher living north of Eagle Pass discovered five unaccompanied migrant children abandoned by smugglers on their farmland Saturday night. The five small girls, ranging in ages from one to six years old, were led across the Rio Grande River and abandoned the evening before. The human smugglers left them with no food, water, or any adults to care for them throughout the night. The rancher’s wife shot a video when they found the children on Mothers Day Sunday morning. The frustrated woman expressed their displeasure for the dangers the children faced throughout the night and the seriousness of their situation. Temperatures reached 103 degrees on Sunday and the children appeared to be exhausted and dehydrated. The ranchers’ employee and his spouse helped care for and comfort the abandoned children while they awaited the arrival of Border Patrol agents. The frustration was easily heard as the rancher’s wife expressed her feelings in a Facebook post. “Five little girls were crossed yesterday afternoon and were dumped with no food, water, nothing,” Kate Coleman Hobbs wrote. “My husband found them this morning while on rounds. The adults in the video are our farm manager and his wife who brought much-needed water and food.” “This is happening everywhere!!!!” she continued. “Share, make calls, raise hell! Stop this inhumanity! This summer is going to be a killer for many! 110 degrees! Stop! Stop this!” In another post, Hobbs said her husband thought one of the little girls was dead. Fortunately, they were able to revive the child and provide water. This incident comes as the Biden Administration opens additional Health and Human Services (HHS) Intake Sites to accommodate a surge in unaccompanied migrant children being smuggled into the United States. The children’s parents are sending the children alone to avoid immediate expulsion under the CDC Title 42 emergency order if crossing as a family unit. According to a law enforcement source, the parents or other relatives illegally enter the United States afterward to claim the children to avoid deportation once the children are freed by HHS."
"Socialist Progression: Calgary Pastor Swarmed By Police, Arrested In Street For Holding Services",10 MAY 2021,1519,"People are deliberately ignorant about the progression and intent of socialism. They have been taught that it’s ‘liberal’ to help others and that everyone getting ‘affordable healthcare’ and other handouts from the government (as opposed to evil capitalism) is a better way. But what they stupidly fail to recognize is history and the push for socialism has one and only goal… complete servitude and control by the new ‘masters.’ In Canada, it’s happening before our very eyes, and while we say “never again,’ we’re watching the rise of fascist Nazism rise in the country and are doing nothing. The Gateway Pundit reported: Artur Pawlowski, the Pastor of the Cave of Adullam Church in Calgary, Alberta, Canada was swarmed by police and arrested after holding an “illegal” church service on Saturday. You may remember Pawlowski as the brave pastor who shouted down police officers who interrupted his church service during Holy Week. “Out of this property you Nazis! Gestapo is not allowed here!” he shouted to police officers interrupting his church service during Easter weekend. “Out, Nazi! Out! Nazis are not welcome here! Do not come back here you Nazi psychopaths!” Pawlowski and his flock kicked out the Gestapo again this weekend. Artur Pawlowski’s fellow pastor Henry Hildebrandt posted a photo of Pawlowski being arrested by the Canadian Gestapo. The Gestapo in Canada has been gunning for Pastor Pawlowski ever since and they arrested him this weekend. You can support Pastor Artur Pawlowski by clicking here."
Fauci Funding Horrid ‘Study’ Using Aborted “Scalps” To Grow Fur On Rats: Protest Planned,7 MAY 2021,4197,"In what is almost too gruesome to report, Fraud Fauci has approved funds for skinning the scalps from aborted babies in order to grow fur on rats. The Gateway Pundit explained: The scientists are using human baby fetal skin processed via removal of excess fat. And Dr. Tony Fauci is funding this gruesome study. Via LifeNews: A new video from the Center for Medical Progress exposes a gristly experiment at the University of Pittsburgh that involved scalping five-month aborted babies and implanting their scalps onto rodents. Now, Pennsylvania leaders are demanding an investigation and urging the university to stop its experiments using aborted baby body parts. “Publicly available information demonstrates that Pitt hosts some of the most barbaric experiments carried out on aborted human infants, including scalping 5-month-old aborted fetuses to stitch onto lab rats,” the Center for Medical Progress said in a statement. The information comes from a study that University of Pittsburgh researchers published in September 2020 in the journal “Scientific Reports.” It describes how scientists used scalps from aborted babies to create “humanized” mice and rats to study the human immune system… … a number of the experiments using aborted baby body parts at the university are funded by U.S. taxpayers through the National Institutes of Health and, in particular, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases office, CMP found in its investigation. The Gateway Pundit reported: The most shocking story of the week. The left is scalping aborted babies to grow hair on rats. And the project is being funded by Dr. Tony Fauci and the NIH. At what point can we question their humanity? We wrote about this horrific development earlier today. Bt now Pennsylvania Christians and people of conscience are speaking out. ** A protest is planned for FRIDAY on PITT Campus at 11 AM. Here is the open later by the Pennsylvania Family Organization. May 3, 2021 Dr. Patrick Gallagher, Chancellor
University of Pittsburgh
420 Fifth Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA 15260 cc: PA House Speaker Bryan Cutler
PA House Appropriations Chair Stan Saylor
PA Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman
PA Senate Appropriations Chair Patrick Browne Dear Chancellor Gallagher, It is completely unacceptable for the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) to conduct unethical research using aborted babies. Student researchers have published experiments of scalps and “full thickness human skin” from aborted babies (18-20 weeks gestation) grafted onto lab rats. Human hair was grown on the backs of these rodents. Additionally, lymphoid tissue, livers and spleens from the same aborted babies were co-engrafted into the same rodent models. This ghastly finding is a product of Pitt’s systemic practices of using aborted babies for inhumane research. Pitt has been involved in hundreds of fetal kidneys and other organs from aborted babies being distributed for research as part of a project funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). Pitt has also had scientists harvesting fetal livers “in vivo” from fetuses delivered via labor induction. Making matters worse is fetal experimentation at Pitt has involved staff employed by Pittsburgh area abortion businesses, Planned Parenthood Western PA and Allegheny Reproductive Health Center. This type of relationship is unacceptable. We, the undersigned, call on the University of Pittsburgh to stop all experimentation on aborted babies and the inhumane practice of grafting their skin and body parts onto rodents. Pitt Health Sciences Tissue Bank, operated jointly by the University of Pittsburgh and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, must cease providing aborted fetal organs and tissue for these unacceptable research practices. All funding from the NIH for these experiments should be eliminated. We also call upon the Pennsylvania state legislature to conduct a full investigation into the University of Pittsburgh, Magee Women’s Hospital and Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania and their connections to the practice of fetal experimentation. Hope you can plan on making this important rally against this unethical and barbaric procedure!"
NJ Doctor Dead On Trip To India After Getting Both Pfizer Vax Shots In US,7 MAY 2021,2655,"A celebrated infectious disease doctor is dead after taking both Pfizer vaccine shots. ABC News explained: A distinguished New Jersey doctor considered a “giant in the field of infectious diseases” has died of COVID-19. Dr. Rajendra Kapila was a professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and was a founding member of the New Jersey Infectious Disease Society. The 81-year-old died in India on April 28, nearly three weeks after testing positive for COVID-19, according to the Hindustan Times. Kapila’s ex-wife, Dr. Bina Kapila, said he went to India — where the pandemic is raging — to help care for his family and had planned for it to be a brief trip, according to ABC New York station WABC. Rajendra Kapila received his medical degree in 1964 at the University of Delhi and completed his residency in India, according to his Rutgers biography. After moving to the United States, he was an intern, resident and fellow at a hospital in Newark, New Jersey. “For 50 years, Dr. Kapila served as a foundational pillar of New Jersey Medical School, the Martland Hospital and University Hospital where he provided care to tens of thousands of patients and trained numerous generations of medical students, residents and fellows,” Rutgers said in a statement. “A genuine giant in the field of infectious diseases, Dr. Kapila was recognized world-wide and sought out for his legendary knowledge and extraordinary clinical acumen in diagnosing and treating the most complex infectious diseases,” Rutgers said. “Dr. Kapila founded the Division of Infectious Diseases and facilitated its continued and extraordinary growth and development into one of the leading infectious diseases programs in the country.” The Weill Cornell Infectious Diseases Division called him “a true legend in” New York City’s infectious diseases community. He also received the Excellence in Teaching Award from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Rajendra Kapila’s wife, Dr. Deepti Saxena-Kapila, told the Hindustan Times that he had received both Pfizer vaccine doses in the U.S. before heading to India. Fully vaccinated people have a significantly lower risk of getting COVID-19 and even lower risk of severe COVID-19. It’s possible to die from the virus after being fully vaccinated, but it’s exceptionally rare. In the United States, out of 105 million fully vaccinated people, about 70 cases of death from COVID-19 have been reported. Mostly of the vaccinated people who died were older and frail, with significant underlying medical conditions. According to his ex-wife, the 81-year-old doctor suffered from diabetes and heart complications, WABC reported."
Tucker Breaks Media Silence: Thousands of Deaths Follow Experimental COVID Vax,7 MAY 2021,16957,"The number of deaths following the supposed ‘life-saving’ COVID vaccine in the United States alone is staggering. It’s more than the total number of deaths from vaccines over the last 20 years, according to data presented by the CDC, which many people argue is deliberately skewed. Last night, Tucker Carlson broke the media silence about these thousands of deaths, and his videos were quickly removed. He stated: How many Americans have died after taking the Covid vaccine? How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines. But what about the potential risks? You’d think you would know more about that than you do. We talk about vaccines constantly, not just on this show, but in this country. Joe Biden was on TV yesterday talking about vaccines. He wants you to get one. Everyone in authority wants you to get one. In fact, you’ve probably already had your shot, and good for you. If you haven’t had your shot, you’re under enormous pressure to get your shot. You understand that soon you may not be able to fly on commercial airplanes or go to work at the office or send your children to school if you don’t have the shot. Meanwhile, the social pressure is enormous. Friends may have already informed you that you’re not welcome at their parties or weddings if you haven’t been vaccinated. There is a lot of pressure to comply. At some point, you probably will comply. It’s just too difficult not be to vaccinated in this country. But before you make the appointment: do you know anything about the potential risks? Probably you don’t know much. We all assume the risks are negligible. Vaccines aren’t dangerous. That’s not a guess, we know that pretty conclusively from the official numbers. Every flu season, we give influenza shots to more than 160 million Americans. Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot. Every death is tragic, but big picture, we don’t consider those numbers disqualifying. We keep giving flu shots, and very few people complain about it. So the question is how do those numbers compare to the death rate from the coronavirus vaccines now being distributed across the country? That’s worth knowing. We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher. The data we just cited come from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System — VAERS — which is managed by the CDC and the FDA. VARES has received a lot of criticism over the years, some of it founded. Some critics have argued for a long time that VARES undercounts vaccine injuries. A report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 concluded that “fewer than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported” by the VARES system. Fewer than one percent. So what is the real number of people who apparently have been killed or injured by the vaccine? Well, we don’t know that number. Nobody does, and we’re not going to speculate about it. But it’s clear that what is happening now, for whatever reason, is not even close to normal. It’s not even close to what we’ve seen in previous years with previous vaccines. Most vaccines are not accused of killing large numbers of people. The Menveo vaccine, for example, is given to people around the world, often children, to prevent bacterial meningitis. In this country, only one person died from that vaccine in the entire period between 2010 and 2015. One. So, compare that to what’s happening now. In just the first four months of this year, the U.S. government has recorded more deaths after COVID vaccinations than from all other vaccines administered in the United States between mid-1997 and the end of 2013. That’s a period of fifteen and a half years. Again, more people, according to VAERS, have died after getting the shot in four months during a single vaccination campaign than from all other vaccines combined over more than a decade and a half. Chart that out. It’s a stunning picture. Now, the debate is over what it means. Again, there’s a lot of criticism of the reporting system. Some people say “well, it’s just a coincidence that someone gets the shot and then dies, possibly from other causes.” No one really knows, is the truth. We spoke to one physician today who actively treats COVID patients. He described what we’re seeing now as the single deadliest mass-vaccination event in modern history. Whatever is causing it, it is happening as we speak. So you’d think someone in authority might want to know what’s going on. If the vaccine injury reporting system is flawed — and it clearly is flawed — why hasn’t it been fixed? And more to the point, why has there not been an independent vaccine safety board to assess what’s happening. And reassure people who stumble across official government numbers on the internet. But amazingly, none of that has been done. No one even mentions the numbers. And in fact, you’re not allowed to. You’ll be pulled off the internet if you do. The people in charge do not acknowledge them. Instead, they warn us about what might happen if we don’t take the vaccine. “People who are not fully vaccinated can still die every day from COVID -19,” Biden said. As a factual matter, that is true. But it’s also misleading. Not all Americans are at a similar risk of dying from COVID-19. Some are at relatively high risk: the old and the sick. They might want to get vaccinated, and most do. Some are at very low risk of dying: the young and the healthy. Others appear to be at essentially no risk at all: anyone who’s had COVID and recovered. Virtually all of those people are immune. That’s true for many viruses. Those second two categories — the young and healthy, and the previously infected — may add up to hundreds of millions of people in this country. The funny thing is, the White House – the official policy-makers who are designing the vaccine rollout – do not acknowledge that those categories even exist. Health Authorities are pretending that everyone’s health and risk potential is exactly the same as everyone else’s. That’s why Joe Biden has demanded that 70 percent of all American adults — regardless of age, regardless of health condition, regardless of pre-existing antibodies — get the COVID shot by the Fourth of July two months from now, or else. This might be an acceptable policy – it would never be an ethical policy – but it might be acceptable to the country if COVID vaccines we could show conclusively came with no risk, and if we truly understood the long-term effects of those vaccines. But neither one of those things is true. We know that according to the government reporting system, thousands of people have died after getting the shot. That is true in this country, where it’s hotly debated when it’s talked about at all, but it’s also true in European countries, whose record-keeping is, if anything, more reliable than ours. Many thousands of other people appear to have been injured after getting the vaccine. VAERS records nearly 900 non-fatal heart attacks in people who just received the shot. 2,700 people reported unexplained chest pain. In all, the vaccine, according to the government reporting system, appears to have contributed to at least 8,000 hospitalizations. Some of the side effects defy explanation. Researcher Alex Berenson has noted that coronavirus vaccines now account for almost one-third of all tinnitus reports in the VAERS database. That’s the ringing in your ears. The American Tinnitus Association says it’s received “many questions” on the link. Researchers at Oxford and UCLA have begun tracking coronavirus vaccine side effects across eight separate countries. They found, that “Women aged 18 to 34 years had a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis than men of the same age.” They also found that heart attacks were “common” in people aged 85 and older who had taken the vaccine. They found serious potential side effects in some children, “anaphylaxis [and] appendicitis were more common in young people.” Vaccines are complicated medicines, and as with any drug, it can take a long time to get it precisely right. The dosage, for example. And this is not the first time people have been hurt during a vaccination campaign. That is bound to happen. What’s different this time, and so striking, is the reaction to these numbers. Here’s a contrast for you: in 1976, the U.S. government vaccinated 45 million people with a vaccine for the swine flu. Fifty-three people reportedly died after getting that shot. The U.S. government immediately halted the vaccination program. Authorities decided it was too risky, it wasn’t worth it. Contrast that with what is happening now. This time, our health authorities have reserved their energy for anyone who dares to question vaccines. LifeSiteNews, a nonprofit news organization, just found itself permanently banned from Facebook. Why? Because it reported government numbers from the VAERS database. When Joe Rogan asked whether healthy young people ought to get the vaccine, the media treated him like a criminal. Almost everything they said was a lie that obscured a very simple and potentially relevant question that he asked, which is: should healthy young people receive the vaccine? We’re not precisely sure what the risks are. It is a lie to say there are no risks. There are risks in everything, including in getting a vaccine. So why not rationally weigh the risk/reward ratio, as we do with every decision we make. For that, he was denounced as an anti-vaxxer kook. A danger to public safety. One of the very few elected officials in the country who has said a word about any of this, who has asked the obvious questions, not attacking vaccines, wondering about their effects, is Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Last week, Johnson asked Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, why so many Americans seem to be dying after the shot. Maybe there’s a good answer for that, Collins wouldn’t even acknowledge that was happening. Instead, Collins fretted if the population focused too much on the harm from vaccines, people might be hesitant to get them. “I challenged his use of the term ‘Vaccine Hesitancy,’” Ron Johnson told us in a conversation today. “I told him that based on the VAERS deaths, and my conversations with people who have chosen not to get vaccinated, a better description would be: ‘People who are hesitant to be coerced into participating in the largest drug trial in history.’” Exactly. There’s a reason many states have more vaccine doses than they can use. Some people just don’t want the vaccine. That’s their right. Period. Not all of them are crazy. Health decisions used to be considered personal choices. We didn’t ask about them. They were considered personal as recently as last fall. In September of 2020, at the height of the presidential campaign, a CNN reporter asked Kamala Harris whether she’d be willing to take the coronavirus vaccine once it became available. “Well, I think that’s going to be an issue for all of us,” Harris responded. “I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump.” A month later, at the vice presidential debate, Harris was if anything more emphatic on the subject. “If Donald Trump tells us we should take” the vaccine, she declared, “I’m not going to take it.” Kamala Harris has, of course, since changed her mind. She’s no longer skeptical of the vaccine, nor does she tolerate the skepticism of others. Instead, she’s an enthusiastic participant in COVID theater. Just today, Harris and her husband made a point of kissing each other in front of photographers while wearing masks. They did this despite the fact they’re married, that they live together, that they were standing outside at the time and despite the fact that they both have been vaccinated. It doesn’t make you laugh. It makes you nervous. Why are they talking to you that way? Why are they giving you the finger on TV? No matter how many fingers they give you, it doesn’t change what remains true for the country: If American citizens are going to be forced to take this vaccine or any other medicine, they have an absolute right to know what the effects of it might be. And they have an absolute right to ask that question. Without being silenced or censored or mocked or given the finger. No amount of happy talk or coercion or appeals to false patriotism can change that. Period. Health Impact News reported: The CDC has just released the newest total of deaths reported following the experimental COVID shots since they were granted emergency use authorization (EUA) in early December through May 3, 2021, and that total now stands at 4,178 deaths reported to VAERS. (Source.) The number of deaths recorded following the experimental COVID injections now equals the total number of recorded deaths following vaccines for the past 20 years. We have previously covered the work of Dr. Peter McCullough, a consultant cardiologist and Vice Chief of Medicine at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, TX. He is a Principal Faculty in internal medicine for the Texas A & M University Health Sciences Center. Dr. McCullough is an internationally recognized authority on the role of chronic kidney disease as a cardiovascular risk state with over 1000 publications and over 500 citations in the National Library of Medicine. He is the most published scientist in the history of his field. He was recently interviewed by Alex Newman of The New American. During this interview he stated: A typical new drug at about five deaths, unexplained deaths, we get a black-box warning, your listeners would see it on TV, saying it may cause death. And then at about 50 deaths it’s pulled off the market. Dr. McCullough compared what is happening today with the experimental COVID shots, which now have 4,178 recorded deaths, according to the CDC themselves, with the last time a vaccine was given an EUA in 1976 during the “Swine Flu Pandemic.” In 1976 they attempted to vaccinate 55 million Americans with the experimental shot, and it had a recorded 500 cases of paralysis and 25 deaths, and so it was pulled from the market. What we are seeing today with so many recorded deaths after the use of experimental pharmaceutical products is unprecedented, according to Dr. McCullough. Watch the entire interview here. The U.S. Government is Deliberately Allowing Big Pharma to Kill American Citizens – Children are Next The official response to all these recorded deaths in VAERS by the CDC remains: A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.  The only thing that changed this week, after the FDA gave the go ahead to resume using the Johnson and Johnson COVID shots that cause fatal blood clots, is that they added this disclaimer: However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event—blood clots with low platelets—which has caused deaths. So they admit there is a causal relationship of the shots causing death, but they put it back on the market anyway, claiming that these adverse events are “rare.” The next target for these killer injections are children, as Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorization with both the FDA in the U.S., and the EMA in Europe, to inject 12 to 15 year olds with their experimental COVID mRNA shots. (Source.) FiercePharma has reported that Canada has just approved the Pfizer shot for 12 to 15 year olds. It was announced on Pfizer’s website today. And the majority of the world’s population seems to be oblivious to the fact that genocide is happening right in front of our eyes, and prefer instead to believe the government “health authorities” who are lying and telling everyone this really isn’t happening."
California Bar Owner Arrested For Making Fake Vaccine Cards,6 MAY 2021,1250,"In California, one bar owner has been arrested for making and selling fake vaccination cards. The DC Patriot explained: The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) announced on Wednesday that it had arrested the owner of the Old Corner Saloon in Clements, California, allegedly for selling fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards. The ABC had received a tip that Todd Anderson, 59, was making and selling the cards at his bar for $20 each, according to authorities. At least 8 were sold before undercover agents, who said they purchased IDs at the bar on multiple occasions in April, shut own the operation. They also confiscated 30 blank cards and a laminating machine. “It is disheartening to have members in our community show flagrant disregard for public health in the midst of a pandemic,” San Joaquin Country Attorney Tori Verber Salazar said in a statement. Distributing, falsifying or purchasing fake COVID-19 cards is against the law and endangers yourself and those around you.” Anderson was charged with falsifying a medical record, falsifying a seal, several counts of identity theft and possession of a loaded unregistered firearm, authorities said. It was unclear at this time whether Anderson has retained an attorney."
Federal Judge Rules On CDC ‘Stopping’ Evictions Across The Country,6 MAY 2021,1717,"The fact that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been able to remove the Constitutional liberties of private citizens just got a huge setback. A federal judge has ruled that the moratorium on evictions is way beyond that unelected agency’s control. Conservative Treehouse explained: U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich has ruled the CDC has exceeded its authority with the federal ban on evictions during the COVID response. [pdf ruling HERE] The issue at the heart of the matter is one of private property rights. As the judge stated: “The question for the Court is a narrow one – “Does the Public Health Service Act grant the CDC the legal authority to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium? It does not.” (WASHINGTON) – Federal Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down on Wednesday the national eviction moratorium, potentially leaving millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has banned most evictions across the country since September. President Joe Biden extended that protection to renters until July. Some 1 in 5 renters across the U.S. are behind on their payments amid the pandemic, and states are scrambling to disburse more than $45 billion in rental assistance. (read more) Judges in Ohio and Texas have previously ruled against enforcement of the ban based on property rights. The federal government cannot block evictions for failure to make payments to private property owners. The Washington Post reported that officials in the Treasury Department were “racing” to distribute COVID relief aid before eviction moratoriums were struck down; the Biden administration knew what they were attempting would be overturned by the courts."
Dems Introduce Bill To “Block” Criminal Background Checks,30 APR 2021,1685,"This week, Democrats in Congress introduced a bill that would prevent employers from conducting criminal background checks. Seriously. The National Pulse reported: The bill, introduced by Representatives David Trone and Maxine Waters, seeks to “amend” the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 by “conditioning eligibility for grants” under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. JAG grants, according to the Department of Justice, compose the “leading source of federal justice funding to state and local jurisdictions.” The program “provides states, tribes, and local governments with critical funding necessary to support a range of program areas” including crime victim and witness initiatives, mental health programs, and crime prevention. The bill would amend the program by introducing an “eligibility” clause for private employers, excluding grant recipients from requiring applicants to disclose their criminal records. What’s more, businesses aren’t even allowed to “‘inquire” about the matter with applicants or “conduct a criminal background check”: ‘‘ELIGIBILITY.—Beginning with the third fiscal year that begins after the date of the enactment of the Workforce Justice Act of 2021, to be eligible for an allocation under this section, a State shall have enacted and be implementing legislation that prohibits private employers from— ‘‘(A) requiring an applicant to disclose whether the applicant has a criminal record; ‘‘(B) inquiring about the criminal record of an applicant prior to a conditional offer of employment; and ‘‘(C) conducting a criminal background check on an applicant prior to a conditional offer of employment.’’"
Yale Epidemiologist: 60% Of New COVID Cases Are In People Already Vaccinated,30 APR 2021,5383,"Dr. Harvey Risch, a distinguished Professor of Epidemiology at Yale University, spoke with Steve Bannon, explaining that 60 percent of all new COVID cases are occurring in people who have already been vaccinated. Lifesite News reported: NEW HAVEN, Connecticut, April 21, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) — An American Professor of Epidemiology at Yale University revealed that the majority of people now coming down with COVID-19 have been vaccinated against the virus. “Clinicians have been telling me that more than half of the new COVID cases that they’re treating are people who have been vaccinated,” said Dr. Harvey Risch. A professor at the Yale School of Public Health, Risch appeared on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program and contrasted the public’s perception of the vaccines’ efficacy with that of the medical establishment. “I think the American public has been sold on the vaccine by the research that shows that they reduce the infection of mild to moderate symptomatic infection by somewhere between 60-90% depending upon age and vaccine and so on and that is pretty good performance for an individual who wants to take a vaccine to protect himself,” Risch said. “However, that is not the measure that public health infrastructure, administration, and Dr. Fauci are using to look at the efficacy of the vaccine.” What the medical establishment is most interested in, Risch believes, is whether or not the vaccines prevent the spread of the infection. As Big Pharma has not provided this information, Risch recommends looking at the data from places where the vaccine has been used. “For that the best place so far has been the mass rollout in Israel where the Pfizer vaccine was given to more than half the population now,” the epidemiologist said. “And in Israel, the studies there show that it reduces the spread of the infection by somewhere around 50-60% so that contributes to herd immunity,” he continued. “But it is not an overnight shutting down of the spread. It is a slow and continuing benefit for society to do that. But it is totally different than each individual’s protection of, say, 90%.” This should be a wake-up call to people who think the vaccine will “free them up from all restrictions,” he said. This cannot happen because, although they might not get symptoms, the vaccine cuts the actual transmission of the virus only by a half. Risch said clinicians have told him that over half of new coronavirus cases have already had a vaccine. “They’ve estimated that more than 60% of the new cases that they are treating – COVID cases – have been people who have been vaccinated,” Risch said. Last summer Dr. Risch caused a stir in medical circles, including his own workplace, when he advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus. On May 27, he published an article in the American Journal of Epidemiology entitled “Early Outpatient Treatment of Symptomatic, High-Risk COVID-19 Patients that Should be Ramped-Up Immediately as Key to the Pandemic Crisis.” In August, he told Fox News host Mark Levin that the evidence was “overwhelming” that hydroxychloroquine reduces risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19. And, check out this story from AZ Family, confirming it: PHOENIX (AP) — A fully vaccinated Arizona state lawmaker has confirmed that she has tested positive for COVID-19. Tucson Democratic Rep. Alma Hernandez announced late Wednesday that she has some symptoms and is quarantining for a week at the home she maintains in Phoenix. “I started feeling extremely fatigued yesterday. I had a migraine and suddenly lost my sense of smell and taste,” said Hernandez. Hernandez said she has lost her sense of taste and smell and has a bad headache, typical mild symptoms of the coronavirus. Her brother, Democratic Rep. Daniel Hernandez, says he tested negative for the virus but will self-isolate for several days and then take another test. Hernandez is at least the eighth Arizona state lawmaker who has confirmed they contracted the virus and the only one known to be fully vaccinated. Republican state Sen. David Gowan had the virus in early March. Alma Hernandez says she was fully vaccinated 11 weeks ago but noted that getting the inoculation does not prevent the infection. “My situation would have been much worse right now if it weren’t for me being vaccinated,” said Hernandez. She says she continued to take precautions such as wearing a mask, washing her hands and social distancing and urges everyone to do so until the pandemic passes. “I think there is a false sense of security that the vaccine is 100% protective, and it’s not,” said Dr. Christopher Van de Wetering, executive vice president with New Amsterdam Sciences. He said the vaccine doesn’t necessarily prevent you from contracting the virus, but it can prevent you from being dangerously ill. CDC studies show the Pfizer and Morderna COVID-19 vaccines are 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalizations in people 65 and older. At least 435 state lawmakers nationwide have tested positive for the disease and seven have died, according to a tally by The Associated Press. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death."
Florida Leads The Way: Legally Banned Vaccine Passports,29 APR 2021,2236,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made a bold move against the national socialist rule (aka updated Nazi party) by signing into law a bill that bans the use of vaccine passports in the state. Conservative Treehouse explained: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was the first U.S. governor to announce he would oppose and block any attempt to make vaccination passports a requirement for any engagement with state government or private enterprise.  DeSantis then signed an executive order temporarily and proactively blocking any effort to require proof of vaccination. Today, the Florida House of Representatives passed a bill (SB 2006) to ban the use of COVID vaccination passports.  This bill will now reconcile with a Florida Senate bill that carried the same intent. Good job Florida! TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – With a key lawmaker saying he recognizes that vaccine hesitancy is “real and understandable,” the Florida House on Wednesday approved a measure that would limit local emergency orders and make permanent Gov. Ron DeSantis’ executive order barring COVID-19 vaccine “passports.” The House voted 76-40 to approve the proposal (SB 2006), which Pandemics & Public Emergencies Committee Chairman Tom Leek, R-Ormond Beach, said would prepare Florida for the next public-health emergency while striking a “delicate balance between protecting people and protecting people’s civil liberties. […] The Senate passed the bill last week, but the measure needs to return to the Senate because of changes made by the House. DeSantis on April 2 issued the executive order blocking COVID-19 passports, which he said would create “huge” privacy issues that could result in people handing over medical information to a “big corporation.” “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society,” DeSantis said before signing the order. “If you want to go to the movie theater, should you have to show that? No. If you want to go to a game, no. If you want to go to a theme park, no. … I think it’s something that people have certain freedoms and individual liberties to make decisions for themselves.” (read more)"
Trans ‘Woman’ Goes Free After Attacking Children In Girls Restroom,28 APR 2021,2772,"In a stunning lack of justice, a trans ‘woman’ in Scotland was set free without punishment after sexually assaulting a child in the girls’ restroom. Breitbart News reported: A trans “woman” was allowed to walk free from Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Scotland after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl in a supermarket restroom. The attacker, whose name is given as “Katie Dolatowski”, waited for the young victim to come out of a toilet cubicle at a Morrisons supermarket in Kirkcaldy, Fife, then grabbed her by the face and forced her back inside. Dolatowski told the girl to remove her trousers and warned that a man outside would kill her mother, according to reports, but she fought back, striking the paedophile in the face, belly, and crotch and tearing away to her father and siblings outside. Dolatowski had attempted to photograph a 12-year-old as she urinated at another supermarket a month prior in nearby Dunfermline — but judge James Williamson decided not to send the sex offender to prison, instead handing down a tagging order and community service order which he claimed was “stringent”. The girl’s mother was horrified, saying she felt “very, very let down” and that she did not have “any confidence whatsoever that [Dolatowski] will not go out and do something equally as bad or worse.” “He was stalking the toilets. He went there specifically to attack a child,” the mother said, declining to use Dolatowski’s preferred pronouns. “We were so, so lucky that nothing worse happened. It was only her reaction that stopped that. It could have been a five-year-old child that wouldn’t have been able to fight back.” Dolatowski, 18, was said to have spent time in the care system growing up and suffer from mental health issues, but the mother was unimpressed. “A lot of people have been in care but they do not go out and assault children,” she said. “I don’t care that he has issues or what his background is, he is a paedophile and he has been let out,” she added. The case prompted the Women and Girls in Scotland group to call for safeguards against biological males in female-only spaces, as elite opinions moves steadily towards allowing people to pick and choose their gender with little or no medical oversight. “This horrific sexual assault of a child is a reminder that sexual predators will take advantage of any access they can get and we should be doing all we can to minimise the risks of such assaults,” a spokeswoman observed. “Over 90 percent of sexual crimes are committed by males. It is extremely concerning that in this climate many female-only spaces can be accessed by males if they simply state they are transgender,” she added. Judge Williamson acknowledges that Dolatowski poses a “moderate risk” of reoffending."
FISA Abuse By FBI Even Worse Than We Knew: Declassified Docs Show NSA Database Used On Gov. Officials,27 APR 2021,3004,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation is nothing more than a Gestapo-controlled agency spying on American citizens. Newly released declassifications show that the atrocities the bureau has committed are even worse than we thought. Not content with conducting an illegal coup against innocent men, the FBI went after other government officials and targeted victims illegally using the NSA database. TechnoFog has compiled the information: A FISA Court opinion and order declassified today reveals continued FBI abuses of “raw FISA-acquired information.” After a DOJ National Security Division review, the FISA Court noted “the FBI’s failure to properly apply its querying standard when searching Section 702-acquired information was more pervasive than was previously believed.” This opinion includes these findings: April 2019 – July 2019: An FBI technical information specialist was involved in “Compliance incidents” by conducting 124 queries of Section 702-acquired information on (1) Volunteers who had requested to participate in the FBI’s “Citizens Academy”; (2) Persons who needed to enter the field office to perform repairs; and (3) Persons who reported they were victims of a crime. August 2019 – October 2019: An FBI Task Force Office “conducted approximately 69 queries using names and identifiers of individuals…” The redactions keep secret the identity of the victims. Other Violations: Judge James Boasberg, who presides over the FISA Court, found little issue with these abuses. In fact, Boasberg concluded: “[T]he Court is willing to again conclude that the improper queries described above do not undermine its prior determination that, with implementation of the documentation requirement, the FBI’s querying and minimization procedures meet statutory and Fourth Amendment requirements.” HOWEVER – Boasberg then concludes that the government has reported numerous incidents involving searches of FISA information without warrants. In other words, the FBI is using FISA acquired information to investigate domestic crimes – not matters of foreign intelligence. These included investigations of “health-care fraud, transnational organized crime, violent gangs, domestic terrorism involving racially motivated violent extremists, as well as investigations relating to public corruption and bribery.” “Public corruption and bribery.” I highlight that last part because it means the FBI continued to improperly use FISA-acquired information to spy on government officials. As we previously reported, Boasberg declined to sentence former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith to prison – not even a day – after Clinesmith altered a CIA email and lied about it to others within the FBI in furtherance of a Carter Page FISA renewal. The FISA heightened duty of candor doesn’t come with heightened punishments for violating that duty. After the latest revelations of abuse and unaccountability, perhaps it’s time for FBI Director Wray, Judge Boasberg, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to go."
House Res. 6666 Begins Government Surveillance of “Individual’s Residences”,27 APR 2021,1833,"Democrats are planning to monitor you at home to ensure that you are following the arbitrary dictates regarding COVID. CDP previously reported on this atrocity, but the Washington Times explained: A House resolution from Illinois Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush that would put Big Government in charge of tracking citizens’ movements as they relate to COVID-19 mitigation efforts — even sending health bureaucrats to “individuals’ residences,” “as necessary,” as the legislation states — has a most apt number: 6666. Mark of the beast. Mark of the beast for a beastly, monstrously unconstitutional bill. After all, what’s more devilishly un-American than launching one of the most massive government surveillance programs of private citizens in U.S. history, all under the guise of protecting people from the coronavirus? That’s the “COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act” in all its $100 billion grant giveaway glory. According to H.R. 6666’s text: The taxpayer funds will be used to “trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through mobile health units and, as necessary … at [citizens’] residences.” That means government comes to your home, taps on your door and demands you take a COVID-19 test. And if you test positive, that means the government makes sure you stay at home. How? Good question. Good unanswered question. Good chillingly unclear question. The top dogs at the Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in control of disbursing the $100 billion to local governments to carry out the COVID-19 testing — more specifically, to “hire, train, compensate and pay the expenses of individuals” to staff mobile health units and to knock on citizens’ doors and to enforce compliance with quarantining."

Buying and Selling Restrictions Begin For Those Who Haven’t Taken The ‘Mark’,23 APR 2021,3280,"Delusions are powerful, and the Enemy knows it. By working to deceive the people with half-truths and ‘questions’ about whether or not now is the End, the people perish. And, it’s working. Although the Bible clearly explains that in the last days there will be a ‘mark’ required to buy and sell… scoffers point to recent events and say that people who believe such things are antiquated conspiracy theorists… meanwhile, a village in Alaska has made it illegal to buy or sell without proof of the vaccine. Lifesite News reported: BETHEL, Alaska, April 22, 2021, (LifeSiteNews) – Kongiganak, a village of fewer than 500 people in Alaska, is requiring inhabitants, the vast majority of whom are Native Americans, to be fully vaccinated to be eligible for any in-person shopping. According to the AP, over a third of Kongiganak residents have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus and two have died from (or with) it. But it is unclear how many of those who supposedly contracted the virus had symptoms or if they were severe. Sheila Phillip, the Kongiganak Traditional Council secretary, said, “people who are fully vaccinated can go inside the village’s two stores if they wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines.” People who have not received experimental coronavirus shots, however, “can still make phone orders and their orders are delivered to their home,” Phillip said. Harvey Paul, general manager for Qemirtalek Coast Corporation, which sells groceries, allows only four people at a time into his store. Paul explained that a list is provided by the tribe with names of vaccinated people. Those entering the store need to be on the list to be allowed to shop. “Every couple of days, they’ll give us a new list,” Paul said. “The list keeps getting bigger and bigger. That is a good sign, you know?” Paul believes forcing people to be vaccinated in order to buy food and other goods in-person is a good thing. “It gives them the incentive, ‘Hey look, I better get vaccinated too so I can go to the store,’” Paul said. “The best way to curb this virus is to get vaccinated.” Nearby stores in the Bethel and other Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages allow non-vaccinated shoppers to enter the store. However, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Fitness Center is also practicing segregation. It reopened on March 1, but only to fully vaccinated individuals. Fitness Center Facility Director Stacey Reardon explained in an interview with KYUK Public Media the plans for verifying vaccinated individuals: “At check in, everybody needs to show their CDC vaccination card and a photo ID.” However, a building full of vaccinated-only people does not mean masks are optional. Reardon said, “Everybody needs to wear masks all the time. And there [are] only two exceptions to that: while swimming and while showering.” It is unclear if any exceptions will be made for pregnant women or people who are allergic to ingredients in the coronavirus vaccines, which are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration but have only been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). It is also unclear if people who went into anaphylactic shock right after receiving the vaccine or had another severe reaction to it and thus did not receive a second dose will ever be permitted in the “vaccinated-only” stores."
Biden Controllers Abolish Public School Learning In Favor Of Full Propaganda Indoctrination,23 APR 2021,4124,"The Biden regime has issued a new decree. Students will no longer be educated, they will be indoctrinated and perpetually kept ignorant. PJ media explained: The Biden Department of Education has quietly proposed a new rule prioritizing the use of federal tax dollars for K-12 schools that replace traditional education with “culturally responsive teaching and learning” – more commonly referred to as critical race theory. This is the most significant move by the federal government to redefine the nature of state-funded public schools in U.S. history. Although the current effort to push public schools receiving federal funding to adopt a detailed indoctrination agenda may feel new and overwhelming for parents, the truth is that the Biden attempt is simply the last phase in a decades-long effort to control local schools and press the progressive agenda on our children. With the power of taxpayer-funded purse strings, the federal government sends a message to public schools that if they want financial aid they must “teach” critical race theory and prioritize its ideologically anti-American, anti-traditional agenda over traditional education. Under Obama, public schools were thrust into the controversial world of Common Core, a series of federal mandates that included “awareness education” involving a progressive view of race, gender, and so-called “equity” (not to be confused with “equality”). Under Biden, a far more aggressive level of federal control over our nation’s K-12 classrooms will replace history (and objective truth) with identity politics and a warped view of American civics and institutions. In many cases, teachers are told to hide the racially divisive curriculum from parents. In others, students are encouraged to report the words and views of their parents and caretakers as examples of institutional racism. The initial goal is the indoctrination of young minds, but the long view is to aggregate power behind an alien political worldview that fed the dehumanizing machines of the Soviet Union and communist China. At its core, critical race theory is the false idea that the United States is a fundamentally racist country and that all of our nation’s institutions – the law, culture, business, economy, education – are designed to maintain white supremacy. Politicians and pundits market critical race theory as inclusive teaching, one that promotes understanding and tolerance. When the truth is exposed, they try to repackage it in a series of euphemisms, including anti-racism, equity, or culturally responsive teaching. But the “scholars,” like Ibram X. Kendi and the 1619 Project behind the related anti-racist rhetoric proposed in the rule – the true believers – admit the truth. Critical race theory curriculum tells students that they fall into one of two categories – the oppressed or the oppressor – based solely on the color of their skin. It tells students that if they are white then they are privileged and racist, and makes them affirm this ideology through classroom discussion and assignments. Some school districts take it even a step further and physically segregate students based on their race for lessons, reducing them to nothing more than a set of racial stereotypes. This is not healthy. It erases decades of progress. And it pits our children against each other, teaching them to hate one another. Parents must stay alert because this week’s proposed rule is just the beginning. Senate and House Democrats have already introduced bills, including the Civics Secures Democracy Act, which would require schools to promote critical race theory in exchange for more federal money. The go-for-broke approach of the Biden administration to upend bulwarks of the American constitutional republic, from Supreme Court-packing to open borders to emptying the public treasury to ensuring federal control of elections, reveals the true agenda: the consolidation of power. And nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in its drive to replace history, reading, and writing with noxious doctrine designed to replace both parental control and constitutional rule of law."
Herpes Side Effect Linked To Pfizer COVID Vaccine,21 APR 2021,1867,"Scientists in Israel have identified a new side effect to the COVID vaccine… herpes. The New York Post reported: Herpes infections may be a side effect of a COVID-19 vaccine, experts have revealed. Scientists in Israel identified six cases in a new study of patients developing a skin rash known as herpes zoster — or shingles — after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, according to a study in the Rheumatology journal. Herpes zoster starts off as a small, itchy skin rash, but if left untreated, it could cause nerve damage and pain, the Jerusalem Post reported. This can include a prolonged burning sensation on the skin even after the rash disappears. Researchers from Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Carmel Medical Center in Haifa found those with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases had a higher risk of developing the herpes infection. Out of 491 patients, six people or 1.2 percent experienced the infection, researchers said. The six patients all have mild cases of autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and were young, though the infection is generally more common in those over the age of 50. “That is why we reported on it,” Dr. Victoria Furer, the lead author, told the outlet. Five of them developed herpes zoster after the first dose and the sixth got it after the second. But it’s still unclear whether the vaccine caused the cases of herpes zoster. “We cannot say the vaccine is the cause at this point,” Furer told the outlet. “We can say it might be a trigger in some patients.” Furer said further research is necessary and one implication could be that patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases be encouraged to get vaccinated against herpes zoster before getting their COVID-19 shot. “We should not scare people,” she told the Jerusalem Post. “The overall message is to get vaccinated. It is just important to be aware.”"
Rep. Jim Jordan Exposes Fauci Fraud for Marxist Controller,16 APR 2021,1141,"Yesterday, during congressional testimony, Dr. Anthony ‘Fraud’ Fauci was exposed for the globalist, opportunist he is, by Jim Jordan. The Gateway Pundit reported: Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH) ripped Fauci apart on Thursday for flip-flopping on Covid mitigation measures. Rep. Jordan, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded Fauci give him a date for the end of Covid restrictions. “15 days to slow the spread turned into 1 year of lost liberty,” Jim Jordan said. To no one’s surprise, Fauci, an unelected, overpaid bureaucrat, said: “I don’t look at this as a liberty thing, Congressman Jordan. I look at this as a public health thing.” Of course not. Fauci is not beholden to the people and doesn’t take an oath to defend the Constitution. Jim Jordan put arrogant Fauci in his place. “Are we gonna be here two years from now wearing masks …?” Jim Jordan asked Fauci. “You’re ranting again,” pompous Fauci retorted. “Here’s how it works, Dr. Fauci. I get to ask you the questions,” Jim Jordan said. Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found"

Veritas Strikes Again! CNN Admits It Is Propaganda To “Remove Trump”,14 APR 2021,4138,"CNN is a network that is ‘presented’ as news, but is really state-sponsored propaganda. Project Veritas exposed it: PART 1: CNN Director ADMITS Network Engaged in ‘Propaganda’ to Remove Trump from Presidency … ‘Our Focus Was to Get Trump Out of Office’ … ‘I Came to CNN Because I Wanted to Be a Part of That’ [NEW YORK — Apr. 13, 2021] Project Veritas released a new video today exposing CNN Director Charlie Chester, who admitted that his network engaged in propaganda to benefit Biden’s candidacy during the 2020 election to the detriment of then-President Trump. Chester also said CNN has a pre-determined agenda when reporting on COVID-19 and climate change. During a conversation with a Veritas journalist, Chester boasted about the impact the network had in determining the outcome of the presidential race last year. “Look what we did, we [CNN] got Trump out. I am 100% going to say it, and I 100% believe that if it wasn’t for CNN, I don’t know that Trump would have got voted out…I came to CNN because I wanted to be a part of that,” Chester revealed. Chester explained to the Veritas journalist how CNN engaged in “propaganda” when covering Trump’s health compared to Biden’s health. “[Trump’s] hand was shaking or whatever, I think. We brought in so many medical people to tell a story that was all speculation — that he was neurologically damaged, and he was losing it. He’s unfit to — you know, whatever. We were creating a story there that we didn’t know anything about. That’s what — I think that’s propaganda,” Chester said. Veritas Journalist: “I guess I have a confession. I worry about Biden and his health, I guess.” CNN Technical Director Charlie Chester: “Your news health?” Veritas Journalist: “What? No, I said Biden, our president.” Chester: “Oh, his health.” Veritas Journalist: “I want to take care of him and make sure he’s okay.” Chester: “He is definitely — the whole thing of him running during the entire — like run for the campaign. Showing him jogging is obviously deflection of his age and they’re [CNN] trying to make it like, ‘Oh, I’m healthy.’” Veritas Journalist: “Is that what we did? I don’t know. Like what do you mean?”  Chester: “We would always show shots of him [Biden] jogging and that [he’s] healthy, you know, and him in aviator shades. Like you paint him as a young geriatric.” Chester went on to say that COVID-19 media coverage should be coming to an end in the near future. He added that CNN is already preparing its shift in coverage to push and promote climate change fear. “I think there’s a COVID fatigue. So, like whenever a new story comes up, they’re [CNN’s] going to latch onto it. They’ve already announced in our office that once the public is — will be open to it — we’re going to start focusing mainly on climate,” Chester said. Chester: “It’s going to be our [CNN’s] focus.

Military Working On Covid Vaccine: Implantable Microchip To Detect Virus,13 APR 2021,1940,"People like to claim that ‘mark of the beast’ Christians are kooks… all while the United States military is literally developing a vaccine and implantable chip that can tell whether a person is ‘infected,’ and globalist governments are establishing ‘cards’ that will allow buying and selling. The Gateway Pundit reported: Pentagon scientists working in a secretive united created a microchip to be inserted underneath the skin, that can detect Covid-19 before the body exhibits symptoms. 60 Minutes interviewed retired Colonel Matt Hepburn, an army infectious disease physician, who spent years with the secretive defense advanced research projects agency or DARPA, working on technology he hopes will ensure COVID-19 is the last pandemic. “Dr. Hepburn showed us a few current projects, some sound like they’re from an episode of “Star Trek.” Consider a ship like the USS Theodore Roosevelt — hobbled last year when 1,271 crew members tested positive for the coronavirus. What if everyone on board had their health monitored with this subdermal implant, now in late-stage testing. It’s not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like gel engineered to continuously test your blood,” 60 Minutes host Bill Whitaker said. Dr. Hepburn told 60 Minutes that the microchip is like a “check engine light.” “That tiny green thing in there, you put it underneath your skin and what that tells you is that there are chemical reactions going on inside the body and that signal means you are going to have symptoms tomorrow,” he said. Dr. Hepburn said that DARPA also created a filter which would be passed through an individual’s blood to remove the Covid virus, “It takes the virus out, and puts the blood back in.” So far, doctors have used this filter to treat 300 critically ill patients. The Pentagon told 60 Minutes that the government isn’t seeking to track your every move with the microchip technology. WATCH:"
RINO ‘China Owned’ Tennessee Governor Gives Businesses ‘Green Light’ For Vax Passports,9 APR 2021,2839,"Tennessee Governor Bill Lee works for the Chinese, much like other RINOS and democrats. And his allegiance was displayed in a recent approval for businesses to require vaccine passports. The Federalist reported: New legislation is moving forward in the Tennessee legislature to implement a ban on government-mandated COVID-vaccine passports, but not a ban on passports required by private companies. On Wednesday, the Tennessee Senate Commerce Committee approved an amendment to a bill governing county health boards to bar any “state or local official, entity, department, or agency” from requiring individuals to present proof of vaccination from the novel Wuhan coronavirus. The committee passed the bill with the attached amendment by 5-1 vote and two senators absent with the governor’s blessing. At Wednesday’s hearing, a representative from Lee’s Department of Health testified the proposed amendment “is coming directly from the governor’s office” and clarified in questioning that the law would still permit private corporations to implement mandates for COVID vaccination for service or entry, just as they may require masks. “It still allows private business to make those determinations for private business,” said the Health Department representative. At the hearing, Republican Sen. Janice Bowling read a statement from the governor in support of the amendment she proposed on Lee’s behalf. “Passports for the COVID-19 vaccine should be a personal health choice, not a government requirement,” she read aloud from the governor. “I’m supporting legislation to prohibit any government-mandated vaccine passports to protect the privacy of Tennessean’s health information.” Lee made clear ahead of the hearing his opposition to vaccine passports used by private businesses, but also didn’t want to ban them from doing so. “I don’t think it’s in the best interest of our state for businesses to impose restrictions and mandates for vaccines, but I also don’t think government should impose itself in the private affairs of business practices,” Lee told reporters, according to the Tennessean. “We’re encouraging businesses in that way, but we’re not going to restrict them.” Lee’s office did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s request for comment. The legislation now heads to the full Tennessee Senate chamber for consideration. Similar vaccine passport bans have been passed in several other states as vaccine availability ramps up with supply and the capacity to distribute. Thirty-eight states including Tennessee, according to a tracker by the New York Times have opened up vaccine eligibility to individuals aged 16 and older. Texas and Florida, both run by Republican governors became the first to ban government-mandated vaccine passports, though private entities operating in Texas may still implement their own."
47-Year-Old MSNBC Analyst Dead One Month After Taking COVID Vaccine,9 APR 2021,2689,"Less than 40 days after taking the experimental and temporary mRNA vaccine, one MSNBC analyst is dead. The COVID Blog explained: NEW YORK — Brooklyn defense attorney and television commentator Midwin Charles is dead after what appears to be several days of suffering after receiving at least one experimental shot. Ms. Charles posted the trendy “I’m vaccinated” announcement on Twitter on March 1. The tweet is still live as of publishing. It is also archived. Her next tweet jokes about her “death causing peanut allergy” and that her insurance did not cover the EpiPen costs. She then retweeted a North Carolina professor talking about “black vax hesitancy.” An analysis of her tweet activity thereafter indicates that her health started deteriorating three weeks later. Ms. Charles, 47, was always very active on Twitter. She averaged about 25 tweets per day since May 2009. Ms. Charles was even more active last month. She averaged 39 tweets/retweets per day from March 10 to March 20, according to Social Blade. Those were her last days of good health. She tweeted only nine times on Sunday, March 21. Keep in mind, her second dose of experimental mRNA would have been due around March 20-21. She tweeted four times on the 22nd, and 10 on the 23rd. She tweeted only once on March 24 and again once March 25. One tweet was deleted on March 26. There was no further activity until Tuesday, April 6 when the family announced she died, 37 days after the first announced experimental shot. This dramatic change in social media behavior suggests she was unable to tweet for over 12 days before passing away. Perhaps she was hospitalized after the second shot. That or she died in late March after the second shot and the family is just now announcing it. Regardless, she has gained 1,163 new Twitter followers today. She gained 481 total in the prior 30 days. Mainstream media censors cause of death As we’ve learned in 2021, vaccines are the leading cause of coincidences. A Google search for Midwin Charles right now brings up stories from The New York Post, New York Daily News, Newsweek, The Hill and a few others as the top results. None of said stories mention the experimental mRNA shot she received on March 1. The experimental Johnson & Johnson viral vector shot had just been authorized for emergency use two days earlier. Thus she received the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA shot. Ms. Charles was born in Brooklyn. She received her law degree from American University in Washington, D.C., and owned a law firm in New York City. She was best known for being a legal analyst on MSNBC and CNN. There are many segments of her criticizing people for not wearing masks, social distancing, etc."
"Biden Says Slavery, Civil Rights, Suffrage Not “Absolute” In Order To Violate Constructional Oath",9 APR 2021,7249,"Joe Biden (or, more accurately, his Marxist controllers) thinks that the amendment in the Constitution prohibiting slavery in the United States isn’t “absolute.” Same for suffrage (the right to vote for women) and the Civil Rights Act… all of these things can be “interpreted” to meet the ‘needs’ and ‘safety’ of the American people. Biden’s treasonous comments were made yesterday. The Conservative Treehouse explained: Earlier today Joe Biden raised some eyebrows when he said “no amendment to the constitution is absolute.”   The first ten amendments to the constitution are commonly known as “The Bill of Rights.” The occupant of the oval office, and head of the executive branch, saying the Bill of Rights is not absolute, should be challenged immediately to qualify that statement. ♦ Amendment 1

– Undelegated Powers Kept by the States and the People The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. Breitbart reported: President Joe Biden declared Thursday that “no amendment is absolute” while unveiling a series of executive actions targeting American citizens’ Second Amendment rights. “Today, we’re taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis,” Biden announced in a speech at the White House’s Rose Garden, claiming: “Nothing, nothing I am about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment.” Biden then called it “bizarre” to criticize his executive actions as “contrary to the Constitution.” As part of his orders, Biden directed the Department of Justice to write laws requiring background checks for homemade “ghost guns.” The president also requested the DOJ develop a model for “red flag” laws for states as a guideline. Additionally, he announced the nomination of gun control advocate David Chipman to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). However, in announcing his pick, Biden referred to the federal agency as the “AFT” — twice. “Gun violence in this country is an epidemic,” Biden said in his remarks, calling the situation “an international embarrassment.” “The job of any president is to protect the American people, whether Congress acts or not,” the president added. “I’m going to use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there’s much more that Congress can do to help that effort.” Biden’s orders swiftly prompted West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) to threaten to sue the Biden administration. “Defending the Second Amendment remains one of the most important priorities for the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. I will not allow the far left to run roughshod over our citizens’ gun rights. If President Biden follows through on his proposals, we will be in court very quickly,” Morrisey said in a statement. “Gun violence and the senseless death attributed to it should pain all Americans, however, the evil acts of a select few should never be a catalyst for stripping the lawful masses of their constitutional rights, especially their right to self-defense and to bear arms.” It’s likely other Republican attorney generals will follow through with their own warnings to the Biden administration. Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) pledged to protect Texans’ Second Amendment rights after Biden reaffirmed his call on Congress to pass legislation aimed at banning “assault weapons” in the wake of the deadly Boulder, Colorado, grocery store shooting. “Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa murdered 10 people in Boulder, CO. Biden immediately called for a ban on ‘assault weapons.’ Dems enthusiastically agree. Let me be clear: As long as I’m AG, the left will *never* be allowed infringe on Texans’ 2A rights,” Paxton tweeted at the time.  Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Joe Biden should be ashamed. pic.twitter.com/IhMVbrGRDe — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 8, 2021 Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found President @JoeBiden: ""Today I'm proud to nominate David Chipman to serve as the director of the AFT [sic].

CDC Changes Story Again: Only 1 In 10000 Chance Of Getting COVID From Surfaces,8 APR 2021,12234,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is at it again. They have lied to the American public repeatedly in order to spread pandemic falsehoods, and now they are admitting that COVID isn’t contagious from surfaces… only rarely. The Gateway Pundit reported: The CDC backtracks again – Now there’s only a 1-in-10,000 chance of getting COVID-19 from surfaces.
Surprise, surprise – the CDC is wrong again. FOX News reports: The CDC has made clear that COVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted mainly through human-to-human interaction but noted last spring that “it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.” The CDC website now cites several studies that “suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the fomite transmission route is low, and generally less than 1 in 10,000, which means that each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing an infection.” This isn’t the first time the CDC has been way off base – pushing frightening data rather than promoting the truth about the China coronavirus. The CDC has had a horrible time determining what to do about masks: CDC Claims Mask Mandates Don’t Have Statistically Improved Impact on Spread of COVID Than No Masks At All – Will Therefore Continue Pushing Masks The CDC has actually been spastic with their recommendations for masks: CDC First Said Not to Wear Masks, Then to Wear Masks, Then Masks Were Better than Vaccines – Now New Evidence Shows Masks Are Ineffective The CDC also has had a horrible time with accurate data: CDC Exposed: Inflated Covid Deaths By 1600% Throughout The Election, “Violated Multiple Federal Laws” Peer-Reviewed Study Finds…State, Local Governments Must Act The CDC ‘wrote’: The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is through exposure to respiratory droplets carrying infectious virus. It is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites), but the risk is generally considered to be low. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an enveloped virus, meaning that its genetic material is packed inside an outer layer (envelope) of proteins and lipids. The envelope contains structures (spike proteins) for attaching to human cells during infection. The envelope for SARS-CoV-2, as with other enveloped respiratory viruses, is labile and can degrade quickly upon contact with surfactants contained in cleaning agents and under environmental conditions. The risk of fomite-mediated transmission is dependent on: Because of the many factors affecting the efficiency of environmental transmission, the relative risk of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is considered low compared with direct contact, droplet transmission, or airborne transmission 1, 2. However, it is not clear what proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are acquired through surface transmission. There have been few reports of COVID-19 cases potentially attributed to fomite transmission 1, 2. Infections can often be attributed to multiple transmission pathways. Fomite transmission is difficult to prove definitively, in part because respiratory transmission from asymptomatic people cannot be ruled out 3, 4, 5. Case reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people by touching surfaces an ill person has recently coughed or sneezed on, and then directly touching the mouth, nose, or eyes 3, 4, 5. Hand hygiene is a barrier to fomite transmission and has been associated with lower risk of infection 6. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) studies have been conducted to understand and characterize the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 fomite transmission and evaluate the need for and effectiveness of prevention measures to reduce risk. Findings of these studies suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the fomite transmission route is low, and generally less than 1 in 10,000, which means that each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing an infection 7, 8, 9. Some studies estimated exposure risks primarily using outdoor environmental SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification data. They noted that their QMRA estimates are subject to uncertainty that can be reduced with additional data to improve the accuracy and precision of information that is entered into the models. Concentrations of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on outdoor surfaces could be expected to be lower than indoor surfaces because of air dilution and movement, as well as harsher environmental conditions, such as sunlight. One QMRA study also evaluated the effectiveness of prevention measures that reduce the risk of fomite transmission and found that hand hygiene could substantially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated surfaces, while surface disinfection once- or twice-per-day had little impact on reducing estimated risks 9. Numerous researchers have studied how long SARS-CoV-2 can survive on a variety of porous and non-porous surfaces 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. On porous surfaces, studies report inability to detect viable virus within minutes to hours; on non-porous surfaces, viable virus can be detected for days to weeks. The apparent, relatively faster inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on porous compared with non-porous surfaces might be attributable to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation 16. Data from surface survival studies indicate that a 99% reduction in infectious SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses can be expected under typical indoor environmental conditions within 3 days (72 hours) on common non-porous surfaces like stainless steel, plastic, and glass 10, 11, 12, 13, 15. However, experimental conditions on both porous and non-porous surfaces do not necessarily reflect real-world conditions, such as initial virus amount (e.g., viral load in respiratory droplets) and factors that can remove or degrade the virus, such as ventilation and changing environmental conditions 8, 9. They also do not account for inefficiencies in transfer of the virus between surfaces to hands and from hands to mouth, nose, and eyes 8, 9. In fact, laboratory studies try to optimize the recovery of viruses from surfaces (e.g., purposefully swabbing the surface multiple times or soaking the contaminated surface in viral transport medium before swabbing). When accounting for both surface survival data and real-world transmission factors, the risk of fomite transmission after a person with COVID-19 has been in an indoor space is minor after 3 days (72 hours), regardless of when it was last cleaned 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15. Both cleaning (use of soap or detergent) and disinfection (use of a product or process designed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2) can reduce the risk of fomite transmission. Cleaning reduces the amount of soil (e.g., dirt, microbes and other organic agents, and chemicals) on surfaces, but efficacy varies by the type of cleaner used, cleaning procedure, and how well the cleaning is performed. No reported studies have investigated the efficacy of surface cleaning (with soap or detergent not containing a registered disinfectantexternal icon) for reducing concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 on non-porous surfaces. From studies of cleaning focused on other microbes, a 90–99.9% reduction of microbe levels could be possible depending on the cleaning method and the surface being cleaned 17, 18. In addition to physical removal of SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes, surface cleaning can be expected to degrade the virus. Surfactants in cleaners can disrupt and damage the membrane of an enveloped virus like SARS-CoV-2 19, 20, 21. To substantially inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, the surface must be treated with a disinfectant productexternal icon registered with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) List Nexternal icon or technology that has been shown to be effective against the virus 22. Disinfectant products might also contain cleaning agents, so they are designed to clean by both removing soil and inactivating microbes. Cleaners and disinfectants should be used safely, following the manufacturer guidance. There have been increases in poisonings and injuries from unsafe use of cleaners and disinfectants since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 23. Some types of disinfection applications, particularly those including fogging or misting, are neither safe nor effective for inactivating the virus unless properly used 24. Surface disinfection has been shown to be effective for preventing secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between an infected person and other people within households 25. However, there is little scientific support for routine use of disinfectants in community settings, whether indoor or outdoor, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission from fomites. In public spaces and community settings, available epidemiological data and QMRA studies indicate that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from fomites is low—compared with risks from direct contact, droplet transmission or airborne transmission 8, 9. Routine cleaning performed effectively with soap or detergent, at least once per day, can substantially reduce virus levels on surfaces. When focused on high-touch surfaces, cleaning with soap or detergent should be enough to further reduce the relatively low transmission risk from fomites in situations when there has not been a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 indoors. In situations when there has been a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 indoors within the last 24 hours, the presence of infectious virus on surfaces is more likely and therefore high-touch surfaces should be disinfected 26. When a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been indoors, virus can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours. The length of time virus remains suspended and is infectious depends on numerous factors, including viral load in respiratory droplets or in small particles, disturbance of air and surfaces, ventilation, temperature, and humidity 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. Wearing masks consistently and correctly can substantially reduce the amount of virus indoors, including the amount of virus that lands on surfaces 32. Based on limited epidemiologic and experimental data, the risk of infection from entering a space where a person with COVID-19 has been is low after 24 hours. During the first 24 hours, the risk can be reduced by increasing ventilation and waiting as long as possible before entering the space (at least several hours, based on documented airborne transmission cases), and using personal protective equipment (including any protection needed for the cleaning and disinfection products) to reduce risk. Certain techniques can improve the fit and filtration effectiveness of masks 32. After a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been in an indoor space, the risk of fomite transmission from any surfaces is minor after 3 days (72 hours). Researchers have found that 99% reduction in infectious SARS-CoV-2 on non-porous surfaces can occur within 3 days 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. In indoor settings, risks can be reduced by wearing masks (which reduces droplets that can be deposited on surfaces), routine cleaning, and consistent hand hygiene. People can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 through contact with surfaces. However, based on available epidemiological data and studies of environmental transmission factors, surface transmission is not the main route by which SARS-CoV-2 spreads, and the risk is considered to be low. The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 is through exposure to respiratory droplets carrying infectious virus. In most situations, cleaning surfaces using soap or detergent, and not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk. Disinfection is recommended in indoor community settings where there has been a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 within the last 24 hours. The risk of fomite transmission can be reduced by wearing masks consistently and correctly, practicing hand hygiene, cleaning, and taking other measures to maintain healthy facilities."
Flynn Touts SPARS 25-28 Video Showing Pandemic “Exercise” Completed In 2017,8 APR 2021,2596,"Almost immediately after President Trump took office, John Hopkins “completed” a planned pandemic “exercise,” which was nearly exactly duplicated in 2019 with COVID. The following videos outline the sinister plot that General Flynn has encouraged us to all watch: BREAKING: General Flynn Calls For Investigation Into SPARS 2025-2028 (banthis.tv) Emergency Saturday Broadcast!

SPARS Pandemic Scenario The Center’s SPARS Pandemic exercise narrative comprises a futuristic scenario that illustrates communication dilemmas concerning medical countermeasures (MCMs) that could plausibly emerge in the not-so-distant future. Its purpose is to prompt users, both individually and in discussion with others, to imagine the dynamic and oftentimes conflicted circumstances in which communication around emergency MCM development, distribution, and uptake takes place. While engaged with a rigorous simulated health emergency, scenario readers have the opportunity to mentally “rehearse” responses while also weighing the implications of their actions. At the same time, readers have a chance to consider what potential measures implemented in today’s environment might avert comparable communication dilemmas or classes of dilemmas in the future. The self-guided exercise scenario for public health communicators and risk communication researchers covers a raft of themes and associated dilemmas in risk communications, rumor control, interagency message coordination and consistency, issue management, proactive and reactive media relations, cultural competency, and ethical concerns. To ensure that the scenario accounts for rapid technological innovation and exceeds the expectations of participants, the Center’s project team gleaned information from subject matter experts, historical accounts of past medical countermeasure crises, contemporary media reports, and scholarly literature in sociology, emergency preparedness, health education, and risk and crisis communication. The scenario is hypothetical; the infectious pathogen, medical countermeasures, characters, news media excerpts, social media posts, and government agency responses are entirely fictional.

Homeless Shelter ‘Cleared’ To House COVID Infected Illegal Aliens: Citizens Kicked Out,8 APR 2021,5047,"In California, a shelter housing homeless American citizens have been ‘cleared’ to make room for COVID-infected illegal aliens. Judicial Watch reported: As if the illegal immigrant crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border were not bad enough, homeless Americans have been booted from a temporary shelter in southern California to make room for scores of migrants, dozens of them infected with COVID-19. Since the Biden administration rolled out the welcome mat, thousands of illegal aliens have entered the country, most of them minors classified as Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) by the feds. Now the government is scrambling to meet its legal obligation of caring for them at facilities nationwide operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In this case, homeless residents were apparently cleared out of the San Diego Convention Center prematurely to accommodate up to 1,450 UAC, though city officials claim the decision to stop using the facility for the homeless predates the illegal alien crunch. Homeless San Diegans have been housed at the center for about a year as part of an initiative to halt the spread of COVID-19. The San Diego City Council voted to extend the program through March, but evidently it was cut short to bring in the illegal immigrants. The city will relocate about 500 homeless individuals to two local shelters, according to a local news report. “The convention center will be used to house migrants through July and will be operated by the federal government and the county,” the story says. So far there are about 743 UAC at the convention center, according to government figures cited in a local news report this week. At least 82 of the migrant teenagers have tested positive for COVID-19. Just this week 247 girls arrived at the makeshift shelter and of that group, 32 have COVID-19, the article states. “Another girl who was placed in the COVID exposed group contracted the virus,” the news story reveals, adding that “officials said none of the minors who tested positive have needed to be hospitalized.” An HHS spokesperson named Bonnie Preston is cited in several news stories saying that the majority of the girls tested positive for the virus before arriving in San Diego and six tested positive upon arrival. The HHS spokesperson further reveals that about 250 UAC will arrive every other day until the convention center reaches its capacity. There are around 11,551—and counting—illegal immigrant minors in HHS shelters and another 5,000 in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol, according to the government. In February alone, more than 7,000 UAC were placed in facilities funded by American taxpayers. Border Patrol figures show that in January there was a 64% increase in UAC over the same one-month period last year with two Texas sectors—Big Bend and Del Rio—seeing the biggest increase in UAC traffic over the same one-month period in 2020, 141% and 122% respectively. The problem is only going to get worse as thousands more are allowed in by the Biden administration. Under federal law HHS takes custody of UAC, identified as illegal immigrants under the age of 18, and must provide care for them. The agency funds and oversees around 170 state-licensed care facilities to house the minors when they arrive from foreign countries south of the border. American taxpayers provide them with an array of services including classroom education, mental and medical health care, legal counsel, and a variety of recreational activities. The overwhelming majority of the migrants—72%—are not children but rather young adults or adolescents 15 to 17 years old, government records show. Most of the youths are from Guatemala and Honduras and 68% are male, which has tremendously boosted gang recruitment in this country. Federal authorities have for years confirmed that the nation’s most violent street gangs—including the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)—recruit new members at U.S. shelters housing UAC. Long before COVID-19, health issues were a serios concern among the hordes of illegal immigrant minors allowed into the U.S. by the Obama administration because they brought in serious diseases, including swine flu, dengue fever and possibly Ebola. The San Diego Convention Center accommodations are not the only special treatment that the illegal immigrants are receiving. They also get live teachers while the pandemic forces local children whose parents fund the public school system to receive instruction online. This week a federal lawmaker, Congressman Darrell Issa, blasted the idea in a statement following reports that teachers will be sent to the San Diego Convention Center to provide in-person instruction for the illegal immigrants. “For more than a year, parents and students in San Diego County have waited for educators to answer one question: When will our schools reopen with in-person instruction only? And for a year, they’ve been told to wait. The decision to provide in-person instruction to illegal migrants is outrageous and parents have every right to be angry.”"
"Biden To Unroll Executive Orders Erasing Second Amendment, Model “Red Flag”",8 APR 2021,6661,"Joe Biden (or rather, his communist controllers) is unveiling new executive orders designed to erase the Second Amendment and violate his ‘oath’ office. The Gateway Pundit reported: Joe Biden and his Marxist handlers announced six ‘initial’ executive actions on gun control Wednesday evening. Joe Biden is breaking his pledge to protect and defend the US Constitution just a few months after stealing the 2020 election. The Biden White House cited the recent shootings in Boulder (Islamic terrorist) and Atlanta (sex addict) in its gun control announcement and claimed the executive actions are “fully within the Admin’s authority and the Second Amendment.” Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing six initial actions to address the gun violence public health epidemic. The recent high-profile mass shootings in Boulder – taking the lives of 10 individuals – and Atlanta – taking the lives of eight individuals, including six Asian American women – underscored the relentlessness of this epidemic. President Biden is reiterating his call for Congress to pass legislation to reduce gun violence. Last month, a bipartisan coalition in the House passed two bills to close loopholes in the gun background check system. Congress should close those loopholes and go further, including by closing “boyfriend” and stalking loopholes that currently allow people found by the courts to be abusers to possess firearms, banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines, repealing gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and investing in evidence-based community violence interventions. Congress should also pass an appropriate national “red flag” law, as well as legislation incentivizing states to pass “red flag” laws of their own. But this Administration will not wait for Congress to act to take its own steps – fully within the Administration’s authority and the Second Amendment – to save lives.  Biden’s six executive actions include: This is just the beginning of Joe Biden’s war on the Second Amendment. Biden also called on Congress to pass gun control legislation. The Gateway Pundit added: The 35 words in Article II, Section I, of the Constitution read as follows: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Joe Biden recited this oath in January and already he is breaking his pledge to protect and defend the US Constitution. On Thursday Joe Biden’s handlers will unveil his executive action on gun control. Joe Biden will limit the Second Amendment by kingly decree. MSN reported: Gun control activists have been invited to an event at the White House about the matter on Thursday, according to a different person familiar with the matter. White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined to comment on which policies Biden would sign but said Biden would discuss the issue on Thursday. “I don’t have anything to preview,” she said. “I can convey that I expect the president will have more to say tomorrow.” The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Conservative Treehouse explained: The White House has released some details of the six executive actions the JoeBama team has put together for Joe Biden to sign. (1)  The Justice Department, within 30 days, will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of “ghost guns.” We are experiencing a growing problem: criminals are buying kits containing nearly all of the components and directions for finishing a firearm within as little as 30 minutes and using these firearms to commit crimes. When these firearms turn up at crime scenes, they often cannot be traced by law enforcement due to the lack of a serial number. The Justice Department will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of these firearms. (2) The Justice Department, within 60 days, will issue a proposed rule to make clear when a device marketed as a stabilizing brace effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act. The alleged shooter in the Boulder tragedy last month appears to have used a pistol with an arm brace, which can make a firearm more stable and accurate while still being concealable. (3) The Justice Department, within 60 days, will publish model “red flag” legislation for states. Red flag laws allow family members or law enforcement to petition for a court order temporarily barring people in crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or others. The President urges Congress to pass an appropriate national “red flag” law, as well as legislation incentivizing states to pass “red flag” laws of their own. In the interim, the Justice Department’s published model legislation will make it easier for states that want to adopt red flag laws to do so. (4) The Administration is investing in evidence-based community violence interventions. Community violence interventions are proven strategies for reducing gun violence in urban communities through tools other than incarceration. Because cities across the country are experiencing a historic spike in homicides, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a number of steps to prioritize investment in community violence interventions. (5) The Justice Department will issue an annual report on firearms trafficking. In 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) issued a report summarizing information regarding its investigations into firearms trafficking, which is one way firearms are diverted into the illegal market where they can easily end up in the hands of dangerous individuals. Since the report’s publication, states, local, and federal policymakers have relied on its data to better thwart the common channels of firearms trafficking. But there is good reason to believe that firearms trafficking channels have changed since 2000, for example due to the emergence of online sales and proliferation of “ghost guns.” The Justice Department will issue a new, comprehensive report on firearms trafficking and annual updates necessary to give policymakers the information they need to help address firearms trafficking today. (6) The President will nominate David Chipman to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. ATF is the key agency enforcing our gun laws, and it needs a confirmed director in order to do the job to the best of its ability. But ATF has not had a confirmed director since 2015. Chipman served at ATF for 25 years and now works to advance commonsense gun safety laws.  (White House Link)"
"President Trump Makes Surprise Call Into Newsmax, Blasts Biden’s Mental State, Corporate Commies",7 APR 2021,3509,"Last night, President Trump made a surprise call to Newsmax for an interview, and the conversation was (as usual) fiery and correct. The Gateway Pundit reported: President Trump joined Heather Childers on Tuesday afternoon on Newsmax for an exclusive interview. During their 21 minute discussion, Childers asked President Trump if Republicans should boycott baseball? Trump responded, “I would say boycott baseball, why not? I think what they did was a terrible thing. I think it was a very unfair thing. And they didn’t even know the bill. And, in fact, I think they were aware of the bill as it was going along. Then as soon as Stacie Abrams speaks up they end up folding. And it should be the opposite. We have more people than they do. You know, the people should boycott those companies that are all of a sudden so righteous. Childers then asked President Trump about Joe Biden’s obvious declining mental capacities. Heather Childers: I want to ask you about Biden and foreign policy, a lot of folks questioning his health and issues that he’s had. We didn’t have a press conference until 64 days in. And then we had China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia who have all challenged him from day one. When it comes to foreign policy and what the Biden administration is doing, specifically North Korea, not even taking their phone call… President Trump: We had peace. We were going to have total peace in the Middle East. We had the Abraham Accords which were incredible and acknowledged to be incredible. Then, of course, I came up with a vaccine. I pushed people like they never had been pushed before at the end… Heather Childers: Do you think he is capable of doing the job from what you’ve seen? I mean you had to do the job. You’re working 24 hours a day, people would actually laugh about the fact that you rarely seemed to be ever sleeping, but it does take that kind of initiative and drive to do the job… Do you think he is up for it, or do you think someone else is doing the job right now? President Trump: well, it does take that kind of drive. It takes strength and enthusiasm and everything you could imagine and the highest levels of every ingredient necessary. When I say full-time, it’s 50 hours a day and you understand what I mean by that. It’s a lot of work. I think other people are making most of the decisions but I may be wrong about that. I don’t know. Obviously, President Trump was being nice. And great job by Childers on having the courage to point out the obvious – that Joe Biden is suffering serious dementia and is not calling the shots in the White House. Conservative Treehouse added: President Trump calls-in to Newsmax for an extensive interview on current events. President Trump notes the corporate “woke” culture is very bad for our country and the hypocrisy in their politics is jaw-dropping. As President Trump points out, many of these corporations are multinationals with home offices outside the United States. President Trump reaffirms the strategy to counter this “woke” movement is to boycott these corporations and their subsidiaries. Additionally, the president discusses the Biden border crisis, the fake news media, the stunning hypocrisy of reporting around the border crisis and the U.S. collapse in foreign policy. President Trump is right, the anger from the presidential election in combination with the ridiculous Mitch McConnell position in the Georgia senate race caused many GOP voters to sit out the Georgia run-off to spite the republican party."
"246 Fully-Vaccinated Michigan Residents Have COVID, 3 Dead In Three Months",7 APR 2021,2634,"The COVID vaccine is deadly, and it makes getting coronavirus more deadly, according to the very authorization forms that must be signed to receive it. Now, 246 people in Michigan have contracted COVID after being fully vaccinated, and three have died. Detroit News reported: As many as 246 Michigan residents considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19 were later diagnosed with the virus, and three have died, state officials confirmed Monday. The cases were reported between Jan. 1 and March 31, and the 246 had a positive test 14 or more days after the last dose in the vaccine series, said Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in an email. “Some of these individuals may ultimately be excluded from this list due to continuing to test positive from a recent infection prior to being fully vaccinated,” she said. “These cases are undergoing further review to determine if they meet other CDC criteria for determination of potential breakthrough, including the absence of a positive antigen or PCR test less than 45 days prior to the post-vaccination positive test. In general, these persons have been more likely to be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic compared with vaccinated persons.” The department had hospitalization data for 117 of the cases, but 129 were incomplete, she said. “Of the 117 with hospitalization data entered, 11 were hospitalized, 103 were not hospitalized, and 3 are reported as unknown,” Sutfin said. The three deaths were “all persons 65 years or older, and two of which were within three weeks of completion of vaccination,” she said. “While the majority of the population develops full immunity within 14 days of completion of their vaccine series, a small proportion appear to take longer to mount a full antibody response. CDC is actively working to better understand the risk characteristics of this group.” The figures come as Michigan COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and officials work to boost vaccinations. As of April 4, about 2.95 million residents, or about 36.5% of Michigan’s population, have been vaccinated, either with one or two doses, according to the state website. About 4.7 million doses had been administered. On Monday, the state surpassed 700,000 cases and still leads the nation in new cases by population. Hospitalizations for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are increasing at a faster rate than before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shuttered indoor dining and suspended in-person high school classes in the fall. Last week, Whitmer said she was increasing the state’s goal from 50,000 shots administered per day to 100,000 shots per day."
AP Furious Arkansas Legislature Overturns Veto On Bill Blocking ‘Child Gender Transition’,7 APR 2021,5556,"Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson destroyed his ‘career’ by vetoing a bill that (overwhelmingly supported by voters) would prevent children from decided to castrate themselves and essentially ruin the rest of their lives before they have the mental maturity to make such a life-altering decision. However, lawmakers in the state overturned that veto, and the Associated Press is extra butt-hurt over the move. The Gateway Pundit reported: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) on Monday vetoed HB 1570, which bans gender transition procedures for minors. “The GOP-sponsored legislation prohibits health care providers from administering gender transition treatments, which can include surgery and hormone therapy, to people under 18.” – the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. Governor Hutchinson called the bill a “vast government overreach.” and referred to it as a “product of the cultural war in America.” “While in some instances the state must act to protect life, the state should not presume to jump into the middle of every medical, human, and ethical issue,” he said. The Arkansas state legislature on Tuesday voted to override Governor Hutchinson’s veto. The House voted 71-24, and the Senate 25-8, to override the governor’s veto. “These children need to be protected,” Republican Rep. Robin Lundstrum, the lead sponsor of the bill, said on Monday according to the Associated Press. The Federalist reported: The majority-Republican Arkansas General Assembly voted Tuesday to override Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s veto of a bill banning experimental genital mutilation and hormone treatments for those under 18-years-old. The passage of HB 1570, the Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act, makes Arkansas the first state in the union to prohibit doctors from administering hormone treatment, puberty blockers, or other treatments to minors. The veto passed in the House at a vote of 71 to 24 and in the Senate 25 to 8. Hutchinson vetoed the legislation on Monday, which originally passed on March 29. The governor claimed the measure was a “product of the cultural war in America” and violated the relationship between a doctor and patient. “This is a government overreach,” Hutchinson said in a press conference Monday. “You are starting to let lawmakers interfere with health care and set a standard for legislation overriding health care. The state should not presume to jump into every ethical health decision.” “We want to send a message of tolerance and diversity,” the governor added. Even though Hutchinson cratered on this legislation, he recently signed the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act” to ban biological men from participating in female sports. Republicans in the state were not pleased with his decision to oppose another piece of legislation to protect minors and oppose psuedo-science that has run rampant in the transgender movement. Upon the announcement of the overriding of Hutchinson’s veto, Family Council, a conservative education and research group based in Little Rock, issued a statement applauding the Arkansas legislature. “Medical researchers do not know the long term effects these procedures and therapies can have on kids. That is why many people equate them with experimenting on children,” Family Council wrote. “The legislature made the right decision to override the governor’s veto on Tuesday. This is good news, and Arkansans ought to be proud of their lawmakers for standing up and protecting the welfare of children.” The overriding of Hutchinson’s veto came after other prominent conservative figures voiced opposition as well. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the “legislature cannot stop now and deprive Arkansas’s children of this much-needed protection.” “These unscientific, destructive gender transition procedures should not be allowed to interrupt the development of children and irreversibly alter their bodies,” Perkins said. Ryan T. Anderson, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, and author of “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” said intervening in the normal physical development of a child for the sake of “gender identity” is unethical. “Prudent legislation is needed to prevent adults from interfering with a child’s normal, natural bodily development. Thankfully, the Arkansas legislature has refused to cave to Big Business special interests. More states should follow their example,” Anderson told The Federalist. Hutchinson won re-election in 2018 after first being elected in 2014. Both Leslie Rutledge, the Arkansas Attorney General, and former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have declared they will run in 2022. HB 1570 will become state law in 90 days after the legislative session concludes on April 30. Conservative Treehouse added: ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host challenged Arkansas Governor Hutchinson on why he vetoed a bill banning youth gender reassignment surgeries. The essential position of Hutchinson is that government should not intervene in medical decisions between parents, children and doctors. Tucker Carlson asked Hutchinson to reconcile laws against children drinking, laws against children getting tattoos, and the absence of a law stopping the chemical castration of children. The interview became very contentious. #BREAKING (AP): Arkansas becomes the first state to ban gender confirming treatments and surgery for transgender youth. The Republican-controlled state legislature voted to override the governor's veto of the measure. — WMAL News (@wmalnews) April 6, 2021"
“Vaccine is Killing Me”: Facebook Fact Check’s 25-Year-Old Woman’s Posts Days Before Death,6 APR 2021,2651,"A 25-year-old woman posted to Facebook about the severe reaction she was having to the COVID vaccine, and the social media platform ‘fact-checked’ her words. Four days later she was dead from ‘natural causes.’ The Gateway Pundit reported: 25-year-old pre-school teacher Desiree Penrod took the Covid vaccine in early March. She then posted on Facebook that “The vaccine is killing me” describing her adverse reaction to the coronavirus vaccine. Facebook flagged the post as fake news. Desiree died a week later. Infowars reported: “The vaccine is killing me today,” the preschool teacher wrote in her last post on March 10. “My arm hurts, beyond exhausted, headache, stomach cramps and earaches. Multiple people told me that I looked pale today. Yesterday, I was fine but today it’s taking its toll on me.” In an unsettling move, Facebook added a fact check label to Penrod’s post citing the Chinese Communist-backed World Health Organization. “Covid-19 vaccines go through many tests for safety and effectiveness before they’re approved,” the label states, telling people to “Learn More at who.int.” An obituary from the Gagnon and Costello Funeral Home states Penrod “passed away unexpectedly” on March 17. Info Wars added: Facebook fact-checked a woman’s account of serious adverse reactions following the Covid vaccine posted one week before she died. The tech giant had the audacity to add a fact check advisory to 25-year-old Desirée Penrod’s personal post in which she documented experiencing fatigue, headaches and earaches after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. “The vaccine is killing me today,” the preschool teacher wrote in her last post on March 10. “My arm hurts, beyond exhausted, headache, stomach cramps and earaches. Multiple people told me that I looked pale today. Yesterday, I was fine but today it’s taking its toll on me.” In an unsettling move, Facebook added a fact check label to Penrod’s post citing the Chinese Communist-backed World Health Organization. “Covid-19 vaccines go through many tests for safety and effectiveness before they’re approved,” the label states, telling people to “Learn More at who.int.” An obituary from the Gagnon and Costello Funeral Home states Penrod “passed away unexpectedly” on March 17, one week after complaining about adverse reactions following the vaccine. Previous posts by Penrod appear to show she was experiencing seizures prior to vaccination and was likely not a good candidate to receive the vaccine due to her medical issues. This is just one example of the absurd lengths Big Tech will go to to defend Big Pharma’s experimental vaccine, even after the facts have been laid out."
"Whoops! CNN Admits Vaccine Must Be “Tied” To Freedom, Otherwise “Carrot” For Dumb Beasts Is Gone",5 APR 2021,1696,"To the ruling elites, you are a dumb beast, who can be controlled with a “carrot.” The Conservative Treehouse explained: There is so much in this soundbite from Dr. Leana Wen (Public Health Policy, George Washington University) it is difficult to encapsulate. When they show you who they are, believe them. In this soundbite Dr. Wen is apoplectic that people might realize there is no need for a vaccination because everything is open and there is no crisis. She frets that American people will enjoy their freedoms without vaccination. Just watch and listen to the priority in her soundbite. The blind-spot exposure of their ideology is a weakness of the totalitarian mind. They spend so much time in an echo-chamber they cannot fathom the insanity of what they are espousing. To them it just seems like the typical conversation they have all the time, because they never face anyone challenging them. “We have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status because if everything is reopened, then what’s the carrot going to be… How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine… So that’s why I think the CDC & the Biden  admin need to come out a lot bolder & say “if you’re vaccinated, you can do all these things…here are all the freedoms that you have, because otherwise people are going to go out and enjoy these freedoms ANYWAY.” Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found  Ooop!

Get Out Nazis! Righteous Calgary Pastor Goes Viral By Protecting His Flock,5 APR 2021,1905,"Right now we are living on a precipice. Various ‘unlawful’ restrictions on basic, fundamental freedoms have been orchestrated by the left in the country (and Canada). Under the guise of “safety” from a cold virus that has a 99 percent survival rate, new ‘rules’ have been ordained, without bothering with the law. And, people are willingly surrendering their rights. Although there are no actual laws yet, evil plans to use intimidation until laws can actually be passed (see the rise of Hitler), so in order to retain our God-given liberties, people must refuse to allow unlawful intimidation. In Calgary, that’s exactly what one pastor did, and his epic victory has gone viral. The Gateway Pundit reported: Now this is how a real man handles the Covid Nazis. Artur Pawlowski, the Pastor of the Cave of Adullam Church in Calgary, Alberta, Canada shouted down police officers who interrupted his church service during Holy Week. “Please get out – immediately get out of this property… I do not want to hear a word!” Pawlowski shouted, demanding they provide a warrant. “Out of this property you Nazis! Gestapo is not allowed here!” he shouted. “Out, Nazi! Out! Nazis are not welcome here! Do not come back here you Nazi psychopaths!” God bless Pastor Artur Pawlowski! Conservative Treehouse commented: This is how all efforts to stop Christian worship should be handled. Christian pastor Artur Pawlowski confronts the COVID compliance police who attempt to enter his church on this holiest of days. This is righteous! This is how you handle police who enter a church without a warrant. They’re lucky they only got a tongue-lashing: s. 176 of the Criminal Code makes it a crime to disturb a church service.

AP Furious That Wisconsin Supreme Court Upholds Law Against Illegal Mask Mandates,1 APR 2021,5643,"In Wisconsin, the democrat governor illegally extended “emergency” orders to extend his tyrannical control over the people of the state, despite the fact that the law forbids such actions. Now, the state Supreme Court has ruled that according to the law of the land, Evers overstepped his authority, and the Associated Press is furious. Citizen Free Press reported: Look at how the AP ignores all mention of the fact the Florida and Texas have seen cases DROP since they’ve shut down the mask mandates. AP ‘reported’: MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide mask mandate on Wednesday, stripping the governor of one of his last remaining tools to curb the spread of the coronavirus as the state stands on the precipice of another surge in infections. The conservative-leaning court ruled 4-3 that Evers violated state law by unilaterally issuing multiple emergency orders to extend the mandate for months. It found that Evers needed legislative approval to issue more orders after the expiration of the initial 60-day mandate he issued in August. “The question in this case is not whether the governor acted wisely; it is whether he acted lawfully. We conclude he did not,” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority. The decision marks another legal defeat for Evers. The state Supreme Court in May struck down his stay-at-home order, finding that his health secretary lacked the authority to issue such an order. A state appeals court blocked Evers’ attempts to limit capacity in bars, restaurants and other indoor places in October. Wednesday’s decision comes as COVID-19 cases have been rising in the state. The seven-day daily case average has jumped from fewer than 400 in mid-March to 470 as of Wednesday. State Department of Health Services Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said the state is seeing “warning signs” that another surge in infections is about to begin. Local mask mandates remain in place. The city of Milwaukee and Dane County, which is home to the state capital of Madison, both have issued such mandates. But invalidating the statewide order leaves Evers with few options to slow the virus’ spread on a broad scale. Evers said in a statement that he’s trying to keep Wisconsin residents safe and that he used science to guide his decisions. He promised to keep working to get people vaccinated and urged people to continue to wear masks. Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, a member of the court’s three-justice liberal minority, lamented in a dissenting opinion that the ruling hampers the ability of Wisconsin governors to protect lives. “This is no run-of-the-mill case,” she wrote. “We are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic that so far has claimed the lives of over a half million people in this country. And with the stakes so high, the majority not only arrives at erroneous conclusions, but it also obscures the consequence of its decision. Unfortunately, the ultimate consequence of the majority’s decision is that it places yet another roadblock to an effective governmental response to COVID-19.” Republican lawmakers applauded the ruling. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said Evers abused his power and that the court’s decision affirms the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said people and businesses should be free to make their own decisions about what’s best for them “and don’t need state government telling them how to live their lives.” Evers argued that he could issue multiple health emergencies because of the changing nature of the pandemic. The mask order first took effect in August and Evers extended it four times since then, most recently on Feb. 4 immediately after Republican legislators repealed it. Research has found that mask mandates and limits on group activities such as indoor dining can help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly 60 organizations opposed a repeal of Wisconsin’s mask mandate, including groups representing hospitals, doctors, nurses, EMTs, school administrators, businesses, children, unions, Milwaukee schools, American Indian tribes, pharmacists, firefighters, local health departments, senior citizens, churches and dentists. Hagedorn joined with the liberal justices in supporting Evers’ stay-at-home order in May, when conservatives held a 5-2 majority. His stance then gave Democrats hope that he would cast the deciding vote to uphold the mask mandate. But during oral arguments in the mask case on Nov. 16, Hagedorn questioned Evers’ authority to renew health emergencies beyond the 60-day limit. He said it was an “extraordinary grant of short-term power to the governor” and that “it seems like the Legislature wanted to allow for only a very short period of time.” The case challenging the mask mandate was brought by Jere Fabick, who gave more than $350,000 to Republican or otherwise conservative candidates in Wisconsin between 1994 and the middle of 2020, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. In 2016, Fabick gave $20,000 to conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley. Fabick is a board member and policy advisor for The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank, and also the president of a multi-state Caterpillar equipment and engine dealer. Health officials on Wednesday reported 563 new confirmed infections and 10 more deaths, pushing the state’s pandemic totals to 577,195 cases and 6,622 deaths. Meanwhile, about 30 percent of the eligible population has received at least one dose of vaccine. Starting Monday, Wisconsin vaccine eligibility will be open to anyone age 16 or older."
"FBI Raids Home Of Young, Female Christian For Walking With Boyfriend At Capitol, No Word On Where She Is",31 MAR 2021,1654,"No word on what has happened to a young Christian woman after the FBI raided her home in the wee hours of the morning, in a Stasi-style apprehension. Apparently, we live in a Nazi state now, where the FBI can detain people secretly? The Gateway Pundit reported: Young female Christian volunteer Elizabeth Rose Williams was arrested last Tuesday by the FBI. As of this writing, her family has not heard from her. Elizabeth was scooped up by FBI agents in an early morning raid at her home in Ingram, Texas. The FBI waited until 4-6 AM to raid this Christian woman’s home. Elizabeth’s friend told The Gateway Pundit, “She is the sweetest girl. I can’t believe this happened.” Elizabeth was planning a Freedom Fest outing on Saturday March 27th in the Ingram City Park. The outing includes face-painting and fireworks and games. The Daily Beast reported on Elizabeth’s arrest with her boyfriend.
They walked through the US Capitol. A Texas lifestyle coach and essential oils guru has been charged after storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 with her QAnon-obsessed boyfriend who documented “patriots [going] to war” on his social media. Elizabeth Rose Williams, a Kerrville, Texas resident, and her boyfriend, Bradley Stuart Bennett, were arrested last week for violent entry and disorderly conduct and knowingly entering a restricted building. In a newly unsealed criminal complaint, prosecutors allege the pair were seen on video wandering around the Crypt and the Senate Chamber gallery as thousands of MAGA rioters stormed the Capitol. “Storming the Capitol. Pray for us all,” Bennett wrote in a Facebook post provided to federal authorities by a tipster."
"Man’s Skin Burns, Swells, Peels Off His Body After COVID Vaccine Shot",31 MAR 2021,3812,"According to ‘officials,’ the COVID vaccine doesn’t actually prevent infection, and if you do contract COVID after getting the shots, you could have a serious (potentially deadly) version… all for a cold virus that ALREADY has a 99% survival rate. Moreover, the number of deaths and serious ‘reactions’ to the ‘vaccine’ are growing. One man’s skin burned, swelled, and literally peeled off his body. The New York Post ‘reported’: A Virginia man suffered a rare reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine that caused a painful rash to spread across his entire body and skin to peel off, doctors said. Richard Terrell, 74, of Goochland began suffering strange symptoms four days after receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, news station WRIC reported. “I began to feel a little discomfort in my armpit and then a few days later I began to get an itchy rash, and then after that I began to swell and my skin turned red,” Terrell told the outlet. But soon the rash covered his entire body, Terrell said. “It all just happened so fast. My skin peeled off,” Terrell told the outlet. “It was stinging, burning and itching. Whenever I bent my arms or legs, like the inside of my knee, it was very painful where the skin was swollen and was rubbing against itself,” he continued. He went to the emergency room at the hospital, where doctors determined that he had experienced an adverse reaction to the vaccine, WRIC reported. “We ruled out all the viral infections, we ruled out COVID-19 itself, we made sure that his kidneys and liver was okay, and finally we came to the conclusion that it was the vaccine that he had received that was the cause,” Dr. Fnu Nutan told the outlet. She said that the medical episode could have been life-threatening if left untreated. “Skin is the largest organ in the body, and when it gets inflamed like his was, you can lose a lot of fluids and electrolytes,” Nutan told the outlet. Still, Nutan emphasized that such reactions are extremely rare. “If you look at the risk for adverse reaction for the vaccine it’s really, really low,” she said. “We haven’t seen a great concern at all. I am a big proponent of the vaccine.” The Gateway Pundit added: A Virginia man’s skin swelled, burned then peeled off in a rare reaction to the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine. 74-year-old Richard Terrell said he began to feel discomfort in his armpit four days after he received the Covid-19 vaccine earlier this month. Soon Terrell developed an itchy rash and his skin began to swell, turn red and burn. “It was stinging, burning and itching,” Terrell said as he described the pain. “Whenever I bent my arms or legs, like the inside of my knee, it was very painful where the skin was swollen and was rubbing against itself.” After a few days, the rash covered his entire body and his skin peeled off. WRIC reported: A Goochland County man suffered a severe reaction after getting his COVID-19 vaccine and VCU doctors believe it was a direct result of the shot. Richard Terrell got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine earlier this month. He suffered a severe rash that spread over his entire body and turned his skin red. The 74-year-old was admitted to the hospital and spent five days at the VCU Medical Center. Terrell was released from the hospital and is now sharing his vaccination story as he recovers from the comfort of his Goochland home. He tells 8News that he’s still very weak and that it will take some time for him to fully recover, but he’s thankful to have received his dose. “It all just happened so fast. My skin peeled off,” Terrell said as he looked down. “It’s still coming off on my hands now.” On March 6, Terrell received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in Ashland. He shares that everything went perfectly fine, however four days later he started experiencing symptoms."
CDC Admits COVID Vaccine Deaths Double Those OF Last Decade: 1700 People Dead In 3 Months,30 MAR 2021,1634,"The number of deaths ‘related’ to vaccines, according to the CDC, has skyrocketed this year, with numbers over 1,750 in less than three months. Of course, those numbers are only the deaths that they can’t explain away with ‘other’ factors. The Gateway Pundit reported: There are more US deaths related to vaccines in 2021 in less than 3 months than there were the entire past decade.
The number of deaths related to vaccines this year has absolutely skyrocketed. According to the CDC’s own data, in 2021 in less than 3 months, we have already seen over 1,750 deaths due to vaccines in the US. This data comes from the CDC’s VAERS database: “The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database contains information on unverified reports of adverse events (illnesses, health problems and/or symptoms) following immunization with US-licensed vaccines. Reports are accepted from anyone and can be submitted electronically at www.vaers.hhs.gov.” The ages of those who have died plies with the elderly. The two primary vaccine manufacturers who have the most deaths related to their vaccines are Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech. Based on a report from the CDC through February 16, 2021, there were over 55 million individuals who have taken the COVID-19 vaccine and most of these vaccines were either manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech. Although the percentage of individuals who have died from the COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ is minuscule (less than 0.003%) the number of deaths in 2021 already is WAY OVER (71 times) the average for the past decade.  pic.twitter.com/LebUEWQWNI — Rodney Howard-Browne (@rhowardbrowne) March 30, 2021  "
"Biden Admin Ok’s Potential Child Predators To Work At Migrant ‘Holding Facilities,’ Refuses Senator",29 MAR 2021,2730,"Because the Biden administration deliberately opened the doors of the U.S. to an invasion, now it needs more child facility workers. No problem. They’ve just decided that there’s no need to protect these children from potential predators. Meanwhile, A U.S. Senator was prohibited from recording video of the concentration compounds. The Gateway Pundit reported: In yet another testament to how little the Democrats actually care about the “kids in cages” that they railed on about for so long under Trump, the Biden admin has now waived FBI background checks for the kid’s caregivers. With the border crisis continuously escalating, the admin is in a major rush to fill the positions — and apparently do not care if the people they are hiring are safe to be around the minors. The Associated Press reports: In the rush to get children out of overcrowded and often unsuitable Border Patrol sites, President Joe Biden’s team is turning to a measure used by previous administrations: tent camps, convention centers and other huge facilities operated by private contractors and funded by U.S. Health and Human Services. In March alone, the Biden administration announced it will open eight new emergency sites across the Southwest adding 15,000 new beds, more than doubling the size of its existing system. Additionally, the report states that “these emergency sites don’t have to be licensed by state authorities or provide the same services as permanent HHS facilities. They also cost far more, an estimated $775 per child per day.” $775 per child, per day! “And to staff the sites quickly, the Biden administration has waived vetting procedures intended to protect minors from potential harm,” the report continues. “Staff and volunteers directly caring for children at new emergency sites don’t have to undergo FBI fingerprint checks, which use criminal databases not accessible to the public and can overcome someone changing their name or using a false identity.” HHS issued a statement saying that the potential staff must still “pass public record criminal background checks,” but that process depends on the honesty of the applicant. “While the various background checks could identify some past criminal convictions or sexual offenses, these checks were not as extensive as the FBI fingerprint background checks,” the HHS inspector general previously said.

"3,964 Dead 162,610 Injuries: EU Database Shows ‘Reactions’ To COVID “Vaccines,” Former Pfizer VP Explains “Massive Depopulation”",26 MAR 2021,15916,"The dangers of the COVID ‘vaccine’ seem to be getting worse… all for a cold virus with a 99% recovery rate (better than the FLU), and now, records show that nearly 4,000 people are dead and over 162,000 have had “adverse” reactions to the supposed ‘miracle.’ In fact, the Former Pfizer VP has warned that the vaccine is possibly being “used for massive-scale depopulation.” Health Impact News reported: The European database of suspected drug reaction reports, EudraVigilance, is now tracking reports of injuries and deaths following the experimental COVID-19 “vaccines.” Here is what EudraVigilance states about their database: This website was launched by the European Medicines Agency in 2012 to provide public access to reports of suspected side effects (also known as suspected adverse drug reactions). These reports are submitted electronically to EudraVigilance by national medicines regulatory authorities and by pharmaceutical companies that hold marketing authorisations (licences) for the medicines. EudraVigilance is a system designed for collecting reports of suspected side effects. These reports are used for evaluating the benefits and risks of medicines during their development and monitoring their safety following their authorisation in the European Economic Area (EEA). EudraVigilance has been in use since December 2001. This website was launched to comply with the EudraVigilance Access Policy, which was developed to improve public health by supporting the monitoring of the safety of medicines and to increase transparency for stakeholders, including the general public. The Management Board of the European Medicines Agency first approved the EudraVigilance Access Policy in December 2010. A revision was adopted by the Board in December 2015 based on the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation. The policy aims to provide stakeholders such as national medicines regulatory authorities in the EEA, the European Commission, healthcare professionals, patients and consumers, as well as the pharmaceutical industry and research organisations, with access to reports on suspected side effects. Transparency is a key guiding principle of the Agency, and is pivotal to building trust and confidence in the regulatory process. By increasing transparency, the Agency is better able to address the growing need among stakeholders, including the general public, for access to information. (Source.) Their report through March 13, 2021 lists 3,964 deaths and 162,610 injuries following injections of three experimental COVID-19 shots: COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE MODERNA (CX-024414), COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE PFIZER-BIONTECH (TOZINAMERAN), and COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (CHADOX1 NCOV-19). There is also data for a fourth experimental COVID “vaccine,” COVID-19 VACCINE JANSSEN (AD26.COV2.S). We have not included data from the Johnson and Johnson COVID shot in this report, but will do so in future reports. A Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the three COVID-19 shots we are including here, and here is the summary data through March 13, 2021. Total reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (code BNT162b2, Comirnaty) from BioNTech/ Pfizer: 2,540 deaths and 102,100 injuries to 13/03/2021 COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE PFIZER-BIONTECH (TOZINAMERAN) Total reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273 (CX-024414) from Moderna: 973 deaths and 5,939 injuries to 13/03/2021 COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE MODERNA (CX-024414) Total reactions for the experimental vaccine AZD1222 (CHADOX1 NCOV-19) from Oxford/ AstraZeneca: 451 deaths and 54,571 injuries to 13/03/2021 COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (CHADOX1 NCOV-19) This is public information funded by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but it is obviously being censored by the corporate media. America’s Frontline Doctors added: America’s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) spoke to former Pfizer Vice President and Chief Science Officer Dr. Mike Yeadon about his views on the COVID-19 vaccine, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, the regulatory authorities, and more. At the outset, Dr. Yeadon said “I’m well aware of the global crimes against humanity being perpetrated against a large proportion of the worlds population. “I feel great fear, but I’m not deterred from giving expert testimony to multiple groups of able lawyers like Rocco Galati in Canada and Reiner Fuellmich in Germany. “I have absolutely no doubt that we are in the presence of evil (not a determination I’ve ever made before in a 40-year research career) and dangerous products. “In the U.K., it’s abundantly clear that the authorities are bent on a course which will result in administering ‘vaccines’ to as many of the population as they can. This is madness, because even if these agents were legitimate, protection is needed only by those at notably elevated risk of death from the virus. In those people, there might even be an argument that the risks are worth bearing. And there definitely are risks which are what I call ‘mechanistic’: inbuilt in the way they work. “But all the other people, those in good health and younger than 60 years, perhaps a little older, they don’t perish from the virus. In this large group, it’s wholly unethical to administer something novel and for which the potential for unwanted effects after a few months is completely uncharacterized. “In no other era would it be wise to do what is stated as the intention. “Since I know this with certainty, and I know those driving it know this too, we have to enquire: What is their motive? “While I don’t know, I have strong theoretical answers, only one of which relates to money and that motive doesn’t work, because the same quantum can be arrived at by doubling the unit cost and giving the agent to half as many people. Dilemma solved. So it’s something else.
Appreciating that, by entire population, it is also intended that minor children and eventually babies are to be included in the net, and that’s what I interpret to be an evil act. “There is no medical rationale for it. Knowing as I do that the design of these ‘vaccines’ results, in the expression in the bodies of recipients, expression of the spike protein, which has adverse biological effects of its own which, in some people, are harmful (initiating blood coagulation and activating the immune ‘complement system’), I’m determined to point out that those not at risk from this virus should not be exposed to the risk of unwanted effects from these agents.” AFLDS: The Israel Supreme Court decision last week cancelling COVID flight restrictions said: “In the future, any new restrictions on travel into or out of Israel need, in legal terms, a comprehensive, factual, data-based foundation.” In a talk you gave four months ago, you said “The most likely duration of immunity to a respiratory virus like SARS CoV-2 is multiple years. Why do I say that? We actually have the data for a virus that swept through parts of the world seventeen years ago called SARS, and remember SARS CoV-2 is 80% similar to SARS, so I think that’s the best comparison that anyone can provide. “The evidence is clear: These very clever cellular immunologists studied all the people they could get hold of who had survived SARS 17 years ago. They took a blood sample, and they tested whether they responded or not to the original SARS and they all did; they all had perfectly normal, robust T cell memory. They were actually also protected against SARS CoV-2, because they’re so similar; it’s cross immunity. “So, I would say the best data that exists is that immunity should be robust for at least 17 years. I think it’s entirely possible that it is lifelong. The style of the responses of these people’s T cells were the same as if you’ve been vaccinated and then you come back years later to see if that immunity has been retained. So I think the evidence is really strong that the duration of immunity will be multiple years, and possibly lifelong.” In other words, previous exposure to SARS – that is, a variant similar to SARS CoV-2 – bestowed SARS CoV-2 immunity. The Israel government cites new variants to justify lockdowns, flight closures, restrictions, and Green Passport issuance. Given the Supreme Court verdict, do you think it may be possible to preempt future government measures with accurate information about variants, immunity, herd immunity, etc. that could be provided to the lawyers who will be challenging those future measures? Yeadon: “What I outlined in relation to immunity to SARS is precisely what we’re seeing with SARS-CoV-2.
The study is from one of the best labs in their field. “So, theoretically, people could test their T-cell immunity by measuring the responses of cells in a small sample of their blood. There are such tests, they are not “high throughput” and they are likely to cost a few hundred USD each on scale. But not thousands. The test I’m aware of is not yet commercially available, but research only in U.K. “However, I expect the company could be induced to provide test kits “for research” on scale, subject to an agreement. If you were to arrange to test a few thousand non vaccinated Israelis, it may be a double edged sword. Based on other countries experiences, 30-50% of people had prior immunity & additionally around 25% have been infected & are now immune. “Personally, I wouldn’t want to deal with the authorities on their own terms: that you’re suspected as a source of infection until proven otherwise. You shouldn’t need to be proving you’re not a health risk to others. Those without symptoms are never a health threat to others. And in any case, once those who are concerned about the virus are vaccinated, there is just no argument for anyone else needing to be vaccinated.” My understanding of a “leaky vaccine” is that it only lessens symptoms in the vaccinated, but does not stop transmission; it therefore allows the spread of what then becomes a more deadly virus. For example, in China they deliberately use leaky Avian Flu vaccines to quickly cull flocks of chicken, because the unvaccinated die within three days. In Marek’s Disease, from which they needed to save all the chickens, the only solution was to vaccinate 100% of the flock, because all unvaccinated were at high risk of death. So how a leaky vax is utilized is intention-driven, that is, it is possible that the intent can be to cause great harm to the unvaccinated. Stronger strains usually would not propagate through a population because they kill the host too rapidly, but if the vaccinated experience only less-serious disease, then they spread these strains to the unvaccinated who contract serious disease and die. Do you agree with this assessment? Furthermore, do you agree that if the unvaccinated become the susceptible ones, the only way forward is HCQ prophylaxis for those who haven’t already had COVID-19? Would the Zelenko Protocol work against these stronger strains if this is the case? And if many already have the aforementioned previous “17-year SARS immunity”, would that then not protect from any super-variant? “I think the Gerrt Vanden Bossche story is highly suspect. There is no evidence at all that vaccination is leading or will lead to ‘dangerous variants’. I am worried that it’s some kind of trick. “As a general rule, variants form very often, routinely, and tend to become less dangerous & more infectious over time, as it comes into equilibrium with its human host. Variants generally don’t become more dangerous. “No variant differs from the original sequence by more than 0.3%. In other words, all variants are at least 99.7% identical to the Wuhan sequence. “It’s a fiction, and an evil one at that, that variants are likely to “escape immunity”. “Not only is it intrinsically unlikely – because this degree of similarity of variants means zero chance that an immune person (whether from natural infection or from vaccination) will be made ill by a variant – but it’s empirically supported by high-quality research. “The research I refer to shows that people recovering from infection or who have been vaccinated ALL have a wide range of immune cells which recognize ALL the variants. “This paper shows WHY the extensive molecular recognition by the immune system makes the tiny changes in variants irrelevant. “I cannot say strongly enough: The stories around variants and need for top up vaccines are FALSE. I am concerned there is a very malign reason behind all this. It is certainly not backed by the best ways to look at immunity. The claims always lack substance when examined, and utilize various tricks, like manipulating conditions for testing the effectiveness of antibodies. Antibodies are probably rather unimportant in host protection against this virus. There have been a few ‘natural experiments’, people who unfortunately cannot make antibodies, yet are able quite successfully to repel this virus. They definitely are better off with antibodies than without. I mention these rare patients because they show that antibodies are not essential to host immunity, so some contrived test in a lab of antibodies and engineered variant viruses do NOT justify need for top up vaccines. “The only people who might remain vulnerable and need prophylaxis or treatment are those who are elderly and/or ill and do not wish to receive a vaccine (as is their right). “The good news is that there are multiple choices available: hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, budesonide (inhaled steroid used in asthmatics), and of course oral Vitamin D, zinc, azithromycin etc. These reduce the severity to such an extent that this virus did not need to become a public health crisis.” Do you feel the FDA does a good job regulating big pharma? In what ways does big pharma get around the regulator? Do you feel they did so for the mRNA injection? “Until recently, I had high regard for global medicines regulators. When I was in Pfizer, and later CEO of a biotech I founded (Ziarco, later acquired by Novartis), we interacted respectfully with FDA, EMA, and the U.K. MHRA.
Always good quality interactions. “Recently, I noticed that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) had made a grant to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)! Can that ever be appropriate? They’re funded by public money. They should never accept money from a private body. “So here is an example where the U.K. regulator has a conflict of interest. “The European Medicines Agency failed to require certain things as disclosed in the ‘hack’ of their files while reviewing the Pfizer vaccine. “You can find examples on Reiner Fuellmich’s “Corona Committee” online. “So I no longer believe the regulators are capable of protecting us. ‘Approval’ is therefore meaningless. “Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg and I petitioned the EMA Dec 1, 2020 on the genetic vaccines. They ignored us. “Recently, we wrote privately to them, warning of blood clots, they ignored us. When we went public with our letter, we were completely censored. Days later, more than ten countries paused use of a vaccine citing blood clots. “I think the big money of pharma plus cash from BMGF creates the environment where saying no just isn’t an option for the regulator. “I must return to the issue of ‘top up vaccines’ (booster shots) and it is this whole narrative which I fear will he exploited and used to gain unparalleled power over us. “PLEASE warn every person not to go near top up vaccines. There is absolutely no need to them. “As there’s no need for them, yet they’re being made in pharma, and regulators have stood aside (no safety testing), I can only deduce they will be used for nefarious purposes. “For example, if someone wished to harm or kill a significant proportion of the worlds population over the next few years, the systems being put in place right now will enable it. “It’s my considered view that it is entirely possible that this will be used for massive-scale depopulation.”"
Americans “Wildly Misinformed” About COVID Risks Thanks To Propaganda Media,25 MAR 2021,6638,"The mainstream media doesn’t report the ‘news,’ the report the carefully crafted, Chinese approved narratives that control what the American people ‘think’ and the ‘issues’ they’re concerned about. That is clearly seen in a recent poll that showed most people are hugely misinformed about the danger of COVID and the deadly dangers of the vaccine. FEE reported: A recent survey found that more than one-third of Americans overestimate by as much as a factor of ten the probability a person with COVID-19 will require hospitalization. Researchers involved in the Franklin Templeton/Gallup study asked Americans in December what “percentage of people who have been infected by the coronavirus needed to be hospitalized.” The correct answer is not precisely known, the authors note, but the best available estimates place the figure between 1 and 5 percent. Many people’s perceptions of the data, however, were completely off. “Less than one in five U.S. adults (18%) give a correct answer of between 1 and 5%,” the study authors said. “Many adults (35%) say that at least half of infected people need hospitalization. If that were true, the millions of resulting patients would have overwhelmed hospitals throughout the pandemic.” The authors of the study say the conclusion is clear. “The U.S. public is also deeply misinformed about the severity of the virus for the average infected person,” the study’s authors stated. ~60% of Americans think the chances somebody with Covid must be hospitalized are ~10x higher than they actually are Survey by Gallup and Franklin Templeton pic.twitter.com/RgyxiJmcfD — Eli Klein (@TheEliKlein) March 20, 2021 Why Are Americans so Misinformed? The obvious question is why Americans are so wildly misinformed about the true risks of COVID-19. One possibility is that Americans are receiving information that is skewing their sense of reality, and research confirms this hypothesis. Studies have shown that US media in particular created a climate of fear by publishing a deluge of negative news in 2020. One Ivy League-led study found that 91 percent of US stories in major media were negative in tone (compared to just 54 percent in non-US media)—even when the virus was in retreat and positive results were being achieved. ‘Those who overestimate risks to young people or hold an exaggerated sense of risk upon infection are more likely to favor closing schools, restaurants, and other businesses,’ the authors note. “The negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive scientific developments including school re-openings and vaccine trials,” researchers noted. “Stories of increasing COVID-19 cases outnumber stories of decreasing cases by a factor of 5.5 even during periods when new cases are declining.” A new @nberpubs paper shows how US media created a climate of #COVID19 fear. “Ninety one percent of stories by US major media outlets are negative in tone versus fifty four percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty five percent for scientific journals,” the authors concluded. pic.twitter.com/wIXRQYiuKw — Jon Miltimore (@miltimore79) December 1, 2020 As I noted when the study was released, a global pandemic isn’t exactly a cheerful topic. Yet this fact alone doesn’t explain the discrepancy between US media coverage and non-US media. Nor does it explain why negative news trends continue even during positive developments—such as declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, as well as vaccine breakthroughs. The steady drumbeat of negativity was described as “panic porn” by some media critics. “Enough with the ‘life will never be the same’ headlines,” HBO pundit Bill Maher said back in April. “Everything looks scary when you magnify it a thousand times.… We need the news to calm down and treat us like adults.” That didn’t happen, however. Months later, as the virus had receded and scientists concluded COVID was not as deadly as previously thought, the media were still engaging in panic porn, characterizing Florida’s laissez-faire approach to the pandemic as a “death march.” In his work Crisis and Leviathan, the economist Robert Higgs observed that crises have been utilized to mount the biggest government power grabs in modern history. Why media and public officials engaged in panic porn for months is a discussion for another day. What’s apparent is that the phenomenon severely skewed Americans’ sense of reality as it relates to the actual dangers of COVID-19, a virus that does not require hospitalization for up to 99 percent of those infected. Unfortunately, authors of the Franklin Templeton/Gallup study say, the disconnect has real-world consequences. “Those who overestimate risks to young people or hold an exaggerated sense of risk upon infection are more likely to favor closing schools, restaurants, and other businesses,” the authors note. Lockdowns: A Policy of Panic The harms of these lockdown policies are well-documented: severe mental health deterioration, mass social unrest, health procedures deferred or foregone, soaring global poverty, increased suicide, extreme loneliness, and many others. FEE’s Brad Polumbo recently testified before the US Senate on some of these dangers, noting that doctors across the world warn lockdowns have resulted in an “international epidemic” of child suicide. These were policies born of panic. “When people feel fear, they’re much more willing to accept anything that makes the world seem a little safer,” Sean Malone noted early in the pandemic in an episode of Out of Frame. For far too long Americans were told they must sacrifice liberty by embracing lockdowns or risk mass fatalities. This was always a false choice, and a dangerous one. The reality is, passing sweeping legislation during panics is a recipe for bad outcomes. But all too often, that is precisely what happens. In his work Crisis and Leviathan, the economist Robert Higgs observed that crises have been utilized to mount the biggest government power grabs in modern history. During the Great Depression it was the New Deal. Following the 9-11 attacks it was the War on Terror and the Patriot Act (and everything that came with them). In 2020 it was the lockdowns. Each of these historic encroachments was driven by mass panic. In each instance, only in hindsight did it become apparent that the greater danger we faced was fear itself. This isn’t to say there are not real threats in the world. The pandemic, terrorism, and the Great Depression were all genuine threats. It’s only to say we must reject panic in our decision-making, and those who would have us abandon freedom for the false promise of safety."
Idaho Churchgoers Sue After Being Arrested For Not Wearing Masks Outside,25 MAR 2021,6437,"After an outdoor church service in Idaho, members were arrested for not wearing masks, so these citizens are suing the city and police. The Daily Wire reported: Three Idaho churchgoers who were arrested last fall for not wearing masks at an outdoor service are suing city authorities for violating their constitutional rights. The Thomas More Society filed a lawsuit this week on behalf of Gabriel Rench, Sean Bohnet, and Rachel Bohnet against the City of Moscow, Idaho, as well as the city’s police chief, its prosecuting attorney, and the two arresting police officers. Rench and the Bohnets made national news last September when approximately 300 people assembled outdoors to sing psalms in front of city hall in Moscow, a town of approximately 25,000 people about 80 miles south of Spokane, Washington. Organized by Christ Church, a prominent evangelical congregation in the town, the event consisted of about 20 minutes of singing and was intended in part to protest Moscow Mayor Bill Lambert’s repeatedly extended mask mandate. Upon learning of the planned event, city officials had arranged small yellow dots six feet apart in the parking lot as guidance for the participants. Speaking exclusively to The Daily Wire after a county magistrate judge threw out the city’s case against him in January, Rench explained that police approached his mother during the psalm sing and asked if she was with him. A mother standing with her son was presumably acceptable because she was family, but when Rench placed his arm around his friend and told the officers that he was also with him, they asked for his identification. State law does not require Idaho residents to identify themselves to law enforcement if they are not driving. Rench refused to provide it, urging the officers instead to join him in exercising his First Amendment rights, at which point he was cuffed and led away to the county jail along with the Bohnets. The jail had to turn the lights on to incarcerate the group, where they were detained for several hours after being cited with violating the face mask and social distancing order. Sean Bohnet, who was placed in a small cell with Rench, noted the irony of the fact that for all their hand-wringing over wearing masks outside, law enforcement did not seem too worried about ensuring they were worn in jail. “We thought a city that would premeditatively break the law in order to detain and jail those lawfully not wearing masks would at least offer one to incarcerated people,” Bohnet said. “However, we were in good company. Staff at the jail occasionally had no issue with letting their faces freely shine too.” Thomas More Society special counsel Michael Jacques, who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement provided to The Daily Wire that Moscow “violated its own ordinance when law enforcement wrongly arrested” his clients. As the city prosecutor conceded when he motioned to dismiss the city’s case in January, city codes allow the mayor to issue public health emergency orders, but that exemptions, unless specifically prohibited, include “any and all expressive and associative activity protected by the U.S. and Idaho constitutions, including speech, press, assembly, and/or religious activity.” Jacques also laid blame upon the law enforcement officers who arrested them, claiming they “demonstrated reckless indifference to the defendants’ First Amendment rights.” “These worshippers had participated in a church sing in the past under the same mask ordinance without any issues and were exercising their freedom as Americans to worship as the Constitution allows,” Jacques explained. “However, the city was so eager to make an example of Christ Church’s opposition to its restrictive COVID rules that the officers failed to follow the mandatory exemptions listed in the city ordinance.” “A motto of government in prosecuting its citizens is that ‘ignorance of the law is no defense,’ and when they recklessly deprive its citizens of their freedoms, ignorance will not be a defense for the government,” Jacques added. The lawsuit alleges that law enforcement were aware of the First Amendment protections within the mayor’s emergency order when they arrested Rench and the Bohnets, and claims their rights were violated under the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment. Noting the charges against them were dismissed only after they were publicly humiliated and slapped with legal fees, Jacques said, “The lives of Mr. Rench and the Bohnets were disrupted not only by the inappropriate actions of law enforcement officers, but also by the city’s prosecuting attorney and other officials who did not immediately act to negate their unlawful detainment.” After the psalm sing incident, the Moscow City Council changed their ordinance regarding public health emergencies to ensure it applies to all persons and activities in Moscow, even political speech. Jacques asserts such a revision renders the ordinance unconstitutional on its face, and he maintained during a Wednesday press conference that the lawsuit is mainly intended to stress to local authorities their constitutional limitations. Rench said the Moscow City Council is sowing discord in the town with their unwillingness to acknowledge how they were violating basic rights. “Instead, the city council revised its order to target myself and others who would exercise their constitutional rights,” he said. “The council’s actions have fragmented Moscow and increased hostility in the broader community.” As Rench told The Daily Wire in January, he has become somewhat of a pariah in the overwhelmingly liberal university town, even after being absolved by the court. “Even after I won and got my case dismissed, a lot of liberals in the community were mad at the city for dismissing the case. They were mad at the judge for dismissing my case. So I was right, and yet I was still wrong to the liberals in our community.” He said he has been flipped off and cussed out by some of his fellow Moscow residents. Nathan Wilson, the son of Christ Church senior pastor Douglas Wilson, has also found himself and his family at odds with the Moscow police and city government, as The Daily Wire recently reported. Describing how his native Moscow has changed since the pandemic, he said, “It’s just kind of sad to discover where we are now and what all this COVID tension and all these mask orders and everything else have turned us into.”"
"Biden Admin ‘Urges’ SCOTUS To Nullify Fourth Amendment, Enter Homes, Take Guns Without Warrant",24 MAR 2021,7980,"The Second Amendment was not designed for self-defense, that’s just a bonus, it was designed to prevent a tyrannical government from making us slaves. The Biden* administration is determined to abolish that protection, along with the Fourth Amendment. Forbes reported: The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear oral argument in Caniglia v. Strom, a case that could have sweeping consequences for policing, due process, and mental health, with the Biden Administration and attorneys general from nine states urging the High Court to uphold warrantless gun confiscation. But what would ultimately become a major Fourth Amendment case began with an elderly couple’s spat over a coffee mug. In August 2015, 68-year-old Edward Caniglia joked to Kim, his wife of 22 years, that he didn’t use a certain coffee mug after his brother-in-law had used it because he “might catch a case of dishonesty.” That quip quickly spiraled into an hour-long argument. Growing exhausted from the bickering, Edward stormed into his bedroom, grabbed an unloaded handgun, and put it on the kitchen table in front of his wife. With a flair for the dramatic, he then asked: “Why don’t you just shoot me and get me out of my misery?” Perhaps unsurprisingly, the tactic backfired and the two continued to argue. Eventually, Edward took a drive to cool off. But when he returned, their argument flared up once again. This time, Kim decided to leave the house and spend the night at a motel. The next day, Kim phoned home. No answer. Worried, she called the police in Cranston, Rhode Island and asked them to perform a “well check” on her husband and to escort her home. When they arrived, officers spoke with Edward on the back deck. According to an incident report, he “seemed normal,” “was calm for the most part,” and even said “he would never commit suicide.” However, none of the officers had asked Edward any questions about the factors relating to his risk of suicide, risk of violence, or prior misuse of firearms. (Edward had no criminal record and no history of violence or self-harm.) In fact, one of the officers later admitted he “did not consult any specific psychological or psychiatric criteria” or medical professionals for his decisions that day. Still, police were convinced that Edward could hurt himself and insisted he head to a local hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. After refusing and insisting that his mental health wasn’t their business, Edward agreed only after police (falsely) promised they wouldn’t seize his guns while he was gone. Compounding the dishonesty, police then told Kim that Edward had consented to the confiscation. Believing the seizures were approved by her husband, Kim led the officers to the two handguns the couple owned, which were promptly seized. Even though Edward was immediately discharged from the hospital, police only returned the firearms after he filed a civil rights lawsuit against them. Critically, when police seized the guns, they didn’t claim it was an emergency or to prevent imminent danger. Instead, the officers argued their actions were a form of “community caretaking,” a narrow exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. First created by the Supreme Court nearly 50 years ago, the community caretaking exception was designed for cases involving impounded cars and highway safety, on the grounds that police are often called to car accidents to remove nuisances like inoperable vehicles on public roads. Both a district and appellate court upheld the seizures as “reasonable” under the community caretaking exception. In deciding Caniglia’s case, the First Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals acknowledged that “the doctrine’s reach outside the motor vehicle context is ill-defined.” Nevertheless, the court decided to extend that doctrine to cover private homes, ruling that the officers “did not exceed the proper province of their community caretaking responsibilities.” Siding with law enforcement, the First Circuit noted that a police officer “must act as a master of all emergencies, who is ‘expected to…provide an infinite variety of services to preserve and protect community safety.’” By letting police operate without a warrant, the community caretaking exception is “designed to give police elbow room to take appropriate action,” the court added. In their opening brief for the Supreme Court, attorneys for Caniglia warned that “extending the community caretaking exception to homes would be anathema to the Fourth Amendment” because it “would grant police a blank check to intrude upon the home.” That fear is not unwarranted. In jurisdictions that have extended the community caretaking exception to homes, “everything from loud music to leaky pipes have been used to justify warrantless invasion of the home,” a joint amicus brief by the ACLU, the Cato Institute, and the American Conservative Union revealed. This expansion could also have perverse effects and disincentivize people from calling for help. As that brief noted, “When every interaction with police or request for help can become an invitation for police to invade the home, the willingness of individuals to seek assistance when it is most needed will suffer.” But in its first amicus brief before the High Court, the Biden Administration glossed over these concerns and called on the justices to uphold the First Circuit’s ruling. Noting that “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’” the Justice Department argued that warrants should not be “presumptively required when a government official’s action is objectively grounded in a non-investigatory public interest, such as health or safety.” “The ultimate question in this case is therefore not whether the respondent officers’ actions fit within some narrow warrant exception,” their brief stated, “but instead whether those actions were reasonable,” actions the Justice Department felt were “justified” in Caniglia’s case. As a fail-safe, the Justice Department also urged the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court ruling on qualified immunity grounds, arguing that the officers’ “actions did not violate any clearly established law so as to render the officers individually liable in a damages action.” But the Biden Administration, along with the courts that have extended the community caretaking exception, overlook a key component of the Fourth Amendment: the Security Clause. After all, the Fourth Amendment opens with the phrase, “the right of the people to be secure.” In an amicus brief, the Institute for Justice noted that “to the Founding generation, ‘secure’ did not simply mean the right to be ‘spared’ an unreasonable search or seizure” but also involved “harms attributable to the potential for unreasonable searches and seizures.” Expanding the community caretaking exception to “allow warrantless entries into peoples’ homes on a whim,” argued the IJ brief, “invokes the arbitrary, looming threat of general writs that so incited the Framers” and would undermine “the right of the people to be secure” in their homes. The IJ brief further argued that extending the “community caretaking” exception to the home would “flatly contradict” the Supreme Court’s prior rulings, which “has only discussed community caretaking in the context of vehicle searches and seizures.” In those cases, “the animating purpose for the exception [was] to allow officers to remove damaged or abandoned vehicles that pose a risk to public safety.” By contrast, the IJ amicus asserted,  “that justification is entirely absent” when it comes to homes. “The Fourth Amendment protects our right to be secure in our property, which means the right to be free from fear that the police will enter your house without warning or authorization,” said Institute for Justice Attorney Joshua Windham. “A rule that allows police to burst into your home without a warrant whenever they feel they are acting as ‘community caretakers’ is a threat to everyone’s security.”  "
Biden Press Hammered About Housing Illegals In Hotels While Vets Sleep On Ground,23 MAR 2021,5955,"While U.S servicemen and women sleep on the cold ground and veterans across the country are homeless and hungry, Joe Biden is spending $86 million to put illegal criminals in hotels. Meanwhile, criminal human trafficking organizations netted nearly $14 million a day organizing the invasion. The Gateway Pundit reported: Newsmax reporter Emerald Robinson on Monday grilled White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki about the Biden Admin’s treatment of illegal aliens vs. its treatment of National Guard troops. One day after Biden’s inauguration, 5,000 soldiers were moved to a cold parking garage in the dead of winter. There was one power outlet and one bathroom for 5,000 soldiers. After Biden used the soldiers for protection, they were tossed into a cold parking garage near the Capitol building. More than a dozen Michigan National Guard troops deployed to Washington, D.C. had been sickened, with some hospitalized, after being served raw, undercooked meat and meals laced with metal shavings according to a report by WXYZ-TV reporter Brian Abel. Other meals the troops have received courtesy of a contractor selected by the Democrat run D.C. government are leaving the troops malnourished. The problem with the undercooked food began in early February but the meals were so bad they prompted a staff sergeant to contact the Detroit news station in early March. It was recently reported that the Biden Administration has let a six-month contract worth $86 million to a Texas non-profit to house up to 1,200 migrant families at hotels in border communities in Texas and Arizona. Robinson grilled Psaki about this and she spun like a top trying to explain why the Biden Admin prioritizes illegal aliens over members of the military. WATCH Reporter: Why are illegal immigrants now getting hotel rooms when the National Guard in DC were left to sleep on the ground in parking garages?  pic.twitter.com/RlO0osTApL — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) March 22, 2021 The DC Patriot added: Remember when everyone lost their mind over our National Guard troops sleeping on the floor of the Capitol and in parking garages in Washington, D.C. because the Biden administration wouldn’t do anything for them? In fact, even President Trump who wasn’t the Commander in Chief at that time offered up his Trump Hotel for troops and officers who needed a warm place to stay. The Biden administration did nothing. Now a White House reporter and friend of ours Emerald Robinson is holding the Biden administrations feet to the fire, and rightfully so. “So, also you are opening up new facilities,” Newsmax’s Emerald Robinson said. “One of the options that is being reported over the weekend is spending $86 million on hotel rooms for some migrants and feeding them.” At the beginning of the questioning, Robinson even asks Psaki about Biden falling on the stairs, and asks if he saw a doctor. Psaki was even snarky in answering those questions. “How do you square National Guard troops who were sleeping in parking garages, and some of them got sick from having contaminated food,” she continued. “That’s a disparity a lot of people are pointing out: That our National Guard were treated one way and then illegal immigrants are going to be put in hotel rooms?” “Well, first let me say that at the time that we became aware of the conditions, National Guard in, in parking garages,” Psaki stalled, “As you noted, the president called the head of the National Guard that day and offered his assistance. Offered to play any role that he could play. Boosting morale, asking for more aid, making sure they had the right — were treated in the way that they deserved for the incredible role they’ve played.” “So, I know that was some time ago,” Psaki continued. “But that’s the reaction he took at the time.” However as you watch the video, Psaki didn’t answer the question, because she couldn’t. The Biden administration has proven they care more about illegals than they do our military. Steve Doocy of Fox News also took Psaki to task at the briefing on Monday. “But if I may, I don’t know if there are CDC guidelines that say, ‘You can be open…” Doocy began. “Are you talking about the shelter?” Psaki interrupted. “Or are you talking about the border patrol.” “Apologies,” Psaki said. “I was misunderstanding your question.” “Yes,” he replied. “Look, I think our objective is to move — this is one of the reasons this is such a focus every single day for the president and this administration,” she continued. “We want to move these kids as quickly as possible through these facilities and into the shelters where they, where there is safe spacing and then move them into homes where there is safe spacing and we are concerned about the public health impact. That’s why we’re putting in place a number of policies to expedite these processes.” “But the first stop it is just not happening,” Doocy objected. “And that is part of the federal government that you guys are in charge of.” “Well, I think I have outlined for you specifically, even a number of steps that we have taken and we’re taking to expedite processing at the border, to ensure we are expediting the timeline, because these border patrol facilities are not made for children,” she replied. “We want to move in part because of COVID in part because they’re not places that have the educational, the health resources and other resources that we believe these children have access to,” she continued. “That’s where all of our focus is on and why we’re working to expedite things. We have a plan for implementing it on that. We’ll be successful. I have limited time so want to go questions of the vaccine.” We need more reporters like these two, actually asking tough questions and holding this administration accountable. The mainstream media hammered President Trump and his administration who did more for Americans than the last 3 Presidents combined, it’s time to ask the tough questions, and make these people work!"
"Human Traffickers Netted $14 Million A Day, Thanks To Biden’s Free Invasion Pass",23 MAR 2021,6908,"The United States is being invaded, and human traffickers are cashing in. Fox News reported: Criminal organizations trafficking women, children, families and single adults over the U.S.-Mexico border earned as much as $14 million a day in February, according to border patrol sources. “Trafficking is a multibillion-dollar industry,” said former Tucson Border Patrol Chief Roy Villareal, who retired in December after 30 years with the agency. “A lot of these vulnerable populations use their life savings. Some are essentially indentured servants and they’re working off this debt for a long period of time. In other cases, some of these migrants are asked to transport narcotics or some form of crime to work off a different part of their debt.” The human smuggling windfall comes as U.S. taxpayer costs for the border crisis continue to spike, topping $5 million a day, based on 2019 figures provided by Health and Human Services that put daily “influx” shelter costs at $800 per migrant. Additionally, last week the Biden administration awarded a $86 million contract for hotel rooms to hold 1,200 migrant families as the crisis exceeds ICE holding capacity. Additional costs will include overtime and hotel costs for the hundreds of agents reassigned to Texas from other areas. For context, in 2019 Congress appropriated an extra $4.6 billion to handle a similar migrant surge. In 2014, Congress gave President Obama an extra $2.7 billion to deal with his border crisis. “The Biden Administration has been an abject failure when it comes to ensuring the safety of unaccompanied minors who cross our border,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbot said in a statement. “President Biden’s refusal to address the border crisis is not only enabling criminal actors like human traffickers and smugglers, but it is exposing innocent unaccompanied children to illness and potentially unsafe living conditions.” On “Fox News Sunday,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the president’s handling of the situation, saying, “We are encouraging families, not to send their children along the dangerous journey because so many do not make it safely. We are encouraging them not to do so. Yet, if they arrive at the border, we have a responsibility to allow them to make their claims under United States law.” An appeals court this year found the U.S. is not legally obligated to accept unaccompanied minors. The Trump administration sent most Central American minors, the majority of whom are ages 15 to 17, back to their home countries to join family there. As part of its media blackout, the Biden administration agencies responsible for caring for the migrants — HHS, DHS and FEMA — all refused to communicate with Fox News when we asked for cost projections. That refusal is despite the fact that former officials tell us each agency keeps a running tally of daily expenses — which include a newly Carrizo Springs, Texas, shelter, one in Midland, Texas, the Dallas Convention Center and prospectively two additional shelters in New Jersey and Florida. NGOs, or nongovernmental organizations, are also looking for taxpayers’ support. The agencies typically step in when ICE or CBP shelters reach capacity. In San Diego, the county asked the California delegation to reimburse Jewish Family Services for shelter, food, transportation and case management for hundreds of migrants taken in since January. “They did hold a gun to our head because they were asking for money to nongovernment organizations that take on these refugees,” said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. “And they wanted an indeterminate amount of money for something permanent. And they wanted basically a blank check.” Issa’s staff asked for a breakdown of expenses, but the county has yet to respond. “The NGOs are happy to take federal dollars to do social work. But at the end of the day, the taxpayers on the hook and probably for a long time to come,” he said. Despite claims of surprise from the White House and Mayorkas, Villareal says top-ranking border patrol officials, including RGV Sector Chief Brian Hastings, specifically warned the incoming Biden team in early December their plans would lead to an influx of migrants. “During the transition, we told them what would happen if they went this route. So, it is both predictable and predicted. And they went down this route. So you have to ask yourself why did they do that, and the answer is they want this flood at the border,” said former ICE chief Ken Cuccinelli. During its daily briefing, the White House has taken a daily shot at the Trump administration, calling its treatment of asylum seekers “cruel” and “inhumane.” But numbers provided by the Justice Department show the Trump administration granted more asylum seeker applications, and at a higher rate, than Obama in his first or second term. Obama Asylum Cases Approved (2009-2012)                         Approvals – 36,536 Grant Ratio – 4.1 Obama Asylum Cases Approved (2013-2016)                                           Approvals – 34,933 Grant Ratio – 6.8 Trump Asylum Cases Approved (2017-2020)                                     Approvals – 57,014 Grant Ratio – 12.8 *Source: Executive Office for Immigration Review As for criminal organizations, profits made at the border are used to pay off and corrupt police and government officials in Central America, further fueling the border crisis. However, Biden claims his strategy to send US tax money south will strengthen those governments. A portion of the smuggling fees are typically paid up front but are mostly paid over time by the worker, their family or an employer. The money pays for transportation, food, shelter and a guide to get over the border. In some cases, the fees also cover transportation to a place of employment where the worker is expected to remain for years. Here are the revenues CBP officials estimate for February. The numbers for single adults and Mexicans were adjusted to account for recidivism. Smuggling Fee Schedule Children/Family — $4,000 – $5,000 Single Adult — $8,000 – $9,000 Mexican — $5000 – $6,000 February Smuggling Revenues Central American Children — $34.1m Central American Families — $80.7m Central American Single Adults — $139.5m Mexicans — $157.2m February Total — $411.5m Daily Average — $14.6m Source: CBP officials to Fox News This week, Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, will lead a delegation of 14 House members to the border. On Sunday, Arrington told “Fox News Live”: “I don’t think that folks in the federal government, whether it’s Mayorkas or it’s members of Congress, are prepared to witness what’s going on at the border as a result of President Biden’s policies. I heard the clip about Mayorkas saying we’re encouraging people to not cross the border. The fact is, actions speak louder than words. And the policies taken together are saying, come one, come all, violate our laws and we won’t detain and deport you.”"
COVID Cases Skyrocket In States With Highest Numbers of ‘Vaccinations’,22 MAR 2021,3029,"The vaccine (for a cold virus with a 99% recovery rate) is apparently failing miserably at stopping new cases of COVID. States with the highest injection numbers show skyrocketing case numbers, leading many people to ask what’s the real purpose of the vaccine. Is it designed(as some have suggested) to obliterate your immune system so that the next time you get a common cold or flu virus, your case is fatal?) Zero Hedge reported: As Europe struggles with a “third wave” of COVID infections that’s forcing more governments to reimpose at least some lockdown measures, the US is finding that the number of newly confirmed cases is climbing again, with some of the biggest week-over-week increases seen in states that had been praised for their vaccination diligence. The US is adding roughly 55K new cases per day, a level that it has plateaued over the past months (though deaths have continued to move lower). Yesterday, health authorities counted 56.9K new case, and 1,052 deaths. COVID cases are spiking in 13 states over the past week. The rebound in new cases in states like Michigan (which is leading the country over the past week with a 53% spike in new cases) Nevada, Maryland and Connecticut are raising concerns about whether new variants discovered in New York State, along with other variants like the Kent Strain (B117) and other international strains. Notably, Michigan is above the US average in terms of its vaccination rate according to Johns Hopkins Data. State officials are blaming variants for the surge, citing a similar dynamic seen recently in Florida and New York. Other states among the highest in vaccination rates—including West Virginia, Maine and Montana—are also dealing with case spikes. Of the 13 states with rising cases, only two – Mississippi and New Hampshire – have below-average vaccination rates. New data from the CDC indicate that the California strain accounted for 13% of all new coronavirus cases that were genetically sequenced as part of a new federal program in late February. An additional 7% of the samples were the strain from the UK. In other news, NY and NJ have continued to ease restrictions on restaurants and indoor dining as restrictions are expected to loosen further heading into next month. Circling back to these new strains, scientists and health officials are on edge because both the UK and Cali strains spread more easily than their predecessors and seem to be more resilient to some of the medicines used to treat COVID-19. The California strain has also shown signs of resistance to the current crop of COVID-19 vaccines, which is just a reminder that a second generation of jabs is already being designed. Studies have found that the California strain, which is one of two new strains first sequenced in the US, is 20% more infectious than other strains. It’s just a reminder that while President Joe Biden keeps talking about families and friends gathering to celebrate July 4 without masks, there’s reason enough to worry about another surge in new cases."
"“Empty Suit” Liar, Joe Biden, Challenged To ‘Live’ Debate By Putin",19 MAR 2021,9755,"Joe Biden is a laughing stock and a liar, and the world is mocking him. The National Pulse reported: Vladimir Putin and his staff sought the almost ritualistic humiliation of then-Vice President Joe Biden, who commanded very little respect on the world stage during his tenure as veep. If it can be believed, he commands even less, now. Ever since that moment I witnessed, Joe Biden and his staffers – with the help of Washington’s press corps – have been spinning the story 180 degrees away from how it actually happened. After Biden lied about his prowess with Putin in a sickly sweet interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Putin pulled his ambassador out of Washington. It’s a pretty big move from Putin out of the blocks. Usually, if you fear a nation and its leader, you don’t start by pulling your ambassador. This is Putin’s telling the Biden regime: “We don’t need you, and we don’t fear you.” It’s quite a stark difference from the Trump administration, which sanctioned Russia while engaging in diplomacy. The media chastised Trump for attempting to avoid a pointless conflict with Russia. That’s the same press that is now fawning over Joe Biden’s kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party. As an aside, Stephanopoulos never pressed Biden on how his son Hunter Biden was compromised by a Putin-friendly Moscow woman’s $3.5 million money transfer, as reported by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last September. I documented what happened at Joe Biden’s one and only meeting with Vladimir Putin in my book Joe Biden Unauthorized. I can attest that the title of my chapter on the incident – Bitch Slapped in Moscow – is the actual truth. Biden got bitch slapped, and he’s pretending he didn’t. Putin knows what happened. He was there. He knows he compromised Joe Biden, who appeared unprepared to deal with the ruthless, former-KGB agent. Regardless, Joe continues to perpetuate his “I was the tough guy” lie. As Joe Biden’s White House stenographer, I stood directly behind Putin at a distance of five feet. Biden, seated across from Putin at an elegant conference table, was about 12 feet from me. About 10 minutes into the meeting, Vice President Biden attempted to start lecturing about his decades-old part in U.S.-Russian negotiations with the dreaded phrase, “I’ve been around a long time. The first time I was here…” And… cut. Joe Biden got about one sentence further into that spiel when off went his microphone, off went the lights for the TV cameras, and stern Russian voices were commanding the press to leave. And leave they did. They went out quickly and efficiently, with videocameras popping off of tripods. Equipment snapping shut. Portable lights clattering down retractable poles. No one spoke, and no one dared linger. This was Putin in all his KGB ruthlessness. Whether by some prearranged signal or simply an undisclosed time limit, he had pulled the plug and done the unthinkable: he’d stolen Joe Biden’s audience and rendered him speechless. Shut him down in mid-sentence with the flick of an invisible switch. Across the table, I could see Vice President of the United States Joe Biden, in the now dimly lit room, looking as duped as an exhausted fish in the bottom of a boat. No protest, no complaint. No, hey, I wasn’t finished. Nothing. He was humiliated. To me, the revelation was the premeditated precision of the snub. Putin or his team had likely plotted this all out. They knew exactly what bait to use, exactly how Joe Biden would take it, and then when he did, they reeled him helplessly in. The Russian President and his delegation sat calmly and coldly as their American counterparts realized their blustery leader’s big moment had been stolen right out from under him. The most powerful man in Russia had neither fear nor respect for Joe Biden. He had just played with him for sport. Here’s a link to the transcript I prepared for the Obama White House Press Office. You can see that it ends with Biden in mid-sentence. So what are we to make of Joe Biden’s “you have no soul” line to Vladimir Putin, which is how he attempts to reclaim the upper hand? Only in his 2017 book Promise Me, Dad did [then-Vice President Biden] describe that meeting as “contentious”. At least he finally came clean about what I saw, though it took him six years. His self-promotional version always centered on his momentary appraisal of Putin. Maybe you’ve heard it before. He has certainly repeated it often enough. After praising Putin’s magnificent office, which Biden teasingly attributed to Russia’s growing acceptance of capitalism, he looked Putin in the eye and said something to the effect of: “I don’t think you have a soul,” to which he said Putin replied in English: “Good, then we have an understanding.” With no press in attendance, we’re asked to take the Vice President at his word. But what are the chances – given what we already know about the exchanges between the two leaders – that this actually happened? Think about it. Biden has spent his whole career boasting about his diplomatic capabilities. Just at the end of the aborted press conference, he was talking about his meetings with Brezhnev. But suddenly he decided to call Putin – apropos of nothing – soulless? The reality is Biden is accidentally giving away one of two things: he either blurted something out having been humiliated in the presser. Or he was abandoning his decades of foreign policy experience for a “gotcha” moment in an empty room with no press. Seems a weird time to do it. Putin’s actions over the entire course of the Obama-Biden administration were always belligerent. Now, with the return of bitch slapped Biden, he’s going right back to that strategy with his version of a Russian “reset”. This doesn’t sound like the genius “diplomat” Joe Biden has portrayed himself as for decades, nor the master strategist the media mindlessly report he is. In fact, Biden new posturing on Russia appears to be luring the U.S. into yet another foreign policy distraction while he gives the Chinese Communist Party just about whatever they want (as long as there’s 10 percent for the “big guy” on the back end). The Gateway Pundit added: Donald Trump Jr. did not hold back when he took to Twitter on Friday to slam Joe Biden over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s debate challenge. Putin had said earlier this week that he wanted to invite Biden to have an open, public, discussion — after the US president said on ABC News that the Russian president would “pay a price” for alleged election meddling and that he is a “killer.” “I want to invite President Biden to continue our discussion, but on the condition that we do this actually live, as they say, online. Without any delay, but directly in an open, direct discussion. It seems to me that it would be interesting for the people of Russia, for the people of the United States, and for many other countries,” Putin said on air on Russian station Rossiya 24. Putin  also said “it takes one to know one” in response to Biden’s accusation that Putin is a “killer.” Naturally, when asked about whether or not Biden would be willing to participate in a public discussion, the White House claimed that he is simply too busy. “The whole world knows that we have no leadership at the top just an empty suit with a teleprompter (and he can’t even get that right),” Trump Jr. tweeted about Putin’s challenge. “They look at America’s weakness right now and are salivating.” The Gateway Pundit reported: Russian President Vladimir Putin upped the ante on Thursday and challenged Joe Biden to a live debate. Stolen elections have consequences. The whole world knows Joe Biden has dementia and that we have no true leadership. The dustup with Russia started earlier this week when Joe Biden threatened Putin and called him a ‘killer with no soul’ during an interview with George Stephanopoulos. A few hours after Biden’s interview with Stephanopoulos aired where he threatened Putin, Russia recalled its ambassador to the United States, a sign relations are strained between the US and Russia. Putin hit back at Biden for calling him a “killer” and said ‘it takes one to know one.’ Biden’s gaffes and dementia already appear to be escalating the US’s relationship with Russia in a bad way. One Russian leader took it a step further blaming Biden’s remarks on his dementia. Andrei Turchak, the leader of the main pro-Kremlin United Russia party, described Biden’s remarks as a reflection of “the U.S. political marasmus and its leader’s dementia.” Fox News reported. Now this… Putin upped the ante and challenged dementia Joe to a live, public debate knowing full well he is incapable because of his cognitive decline. “I’ve just thought of this now,” Putin told a Russian state TV reporter. “I want to propose to President Biden to continue our discussion, but on the condition that we do it basically live, as it’s called, without any delays and directly in an open, direct discussion,” Putin said. “I don’t want to put this off for long. I want to go the taiga this weekend to relax a little. So we could do it tomorrow or Monday. We are ready at any time convenient for the American side.” Putin continued, “it seems to me that would be interesting for the people of Russia and for the people of the United States.” “With regard to my U.S. colleague’s remark, we have, indeed, as he said, met in person. What would I tell him? I would say ‘stay healthy.’ I wish him good health,” Putin said, adding. “I am saying this without irony or tongue in cheek.” Update: The New York Post reported that Joe Biden declined Putin’s challenge to a debate and said Biden is “quite busy.” Just like Barack Obama said, “Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f*ck things up.”"
"Courts Finally Agree About Election Rig: Trump Was Right, They Stole It",19 MAR 2021,6171,"Recent victories in court show that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, but apparently, we’re not going to do anything about it. Just the News reported: Long after former President Donald Trump dropped his legal challenges to the 2020 election, some courts in battleground states are beginning to declare the way widespread absentee ballots were implemented or counted violated state laws. The latest ruling came this month in Michigan, where the State Court of Claims concluded that Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s instructions on signature verification for absentee ballots violated state law. Benson had instructed local election clerks a month before the Nov. 3 election to start with a “presumption” that all signatures on absentee ballots were valid and only reject those that had “multiple significant and obvious” inconsistencies. Republicans and one election clerk challenged her instructions in court. Chief Court of Claims Judge Christopher M. Murray ruled March 9 that the state Legislature did not provide such guidance in its election laws, and therefore Benson needed to promulgate a formal rule – a timely process – before imposing such a requirement. Murray told election clerks they should disregard Benson’s instructions in future elections. “An agency must utilize formal rule-making procedures when establishing policies that ‘do not merely interpret or explain the statute or rules from which the agency derives its authority,’ but rather ‘establish the substantive standards implementing the program,'” Murray ruled. “The guidance issued by the Secretary of State on October 6, 2020, with respect to signature-matching standards was issued in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act,” he concluded. Benson’s office has not said whether it will appeal. In neighboring Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court handed down a significant ruling in December when the justices concluded that state and local election officials erred when they gave blanket permission allowing voters to declare themselves homebound and skip voter ID requirements in the 2020 elections. In a case challenging the practice in Dane County, one of Wisconsin’s large urban centers around the city of Madison, the state’s highest court ruled that only those voters whose “own age, physical illness or infirmity” makes them homebound could declare themselves “indefinitely confined” and avoid complying with a requirement for photo ID. The mere existence of a COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown orders was not sufficient under Wisconsin law for all persons to skip the voter ID requirements to seek to vote absentee, the justices ruled. “We conclude that both the contention that electors qualify as indefinitely confined solely as the result of the COVID19 pandemic and the declared public health emergency and the contention that Wis. Stat. § 6.86(2)(a) could be used for those who ‘have trouble presenting a valid ID’ are erroneous because those reasons do not come within the statutory criteria,” the court ruled. In so doing, the court ruled that local officials like Dane County and Gov. Tony Evers did not have legal authority to exempt all voters to get an absentee ballot without an ID. Evers had issued an executive order earlier this year. “We conclude that [Evers’] Emergency Order #12 did not render all Wisconsin electors ‘indefinitely confined,’ thereby obviating the requirement of a valid photo identification to obtain an absentee ballot,” the majority ruling concluded. The court filings indicated nearly 200,000 voters declared themselves permanently confined in the state’s spring primary, a marked rise over prior years, and even more did so in the general election. Biden won Wisconsin by just 20,000 votes. Meanwhile in Virginia, a judge in January approved a consent decree permanently banning the acceptance of ballots without postmarks after Election Day, concluding that instructions from the Virginia Department of Elections to the contrary in 2020 had violated state law. An electoral board member in Frederick County challenged the legality of the state’s instruction and won though the ruling came after the election. “If the return envelope has a missing postmark, the ballot shall be rendered invalid,” Frederick County Circuit Judge William W. Eldridge IV ruled in the consent decree. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, which represented electoral board member Thomas Reed called the ruling “a big win for the Rule of Law.” “This consent decree gives Mr. Reed everything he requested – a permanent ban on accepting ballots without postmarks after Election Day and is a loss for the Virginia bureaucrats who said ballots could come in without these protections,” PILF President and General Counsel J. Christian Adams said. Several more legal challenges remain in states, as well as two audits/investigations of voting machine logs that are pending in Georgia and Arizona. And while there has been no proof the elections were impacted by widespread fraud, there are still significant disputes over whether rule changes and absentee ballot procedures in key swing states may have been unlawful. In addition, the Thomas More Society’s Amistad Project on election integrity is pursuing litigation over whether hundreds of millions of dollars donated by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and routed to local election officials in several battleground states may have unlawfully influenced the election, according to the project’s director, Phill Kline. “We’re expanding our litigation,” Kline told the John Solomon Reports podcast on Wednesday. “I still have suits that are active in Michigan and Georgia on this, and you’ll see us take new action in Wisconsin. And we will renew action in Pennsylvania. And, and our involvement in Arizona will take a little bit of a different tack, but will involve this. The Arizona legislature is going to do an audit and we want this within the scope.” In other words, the election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump may be settled, but the battle over how elections will be governed – especially as it relates to absentee ballots and private funding of election clerks – has only just begun."
Canada Father Jailed After ‘Misgendering’ His “Daughter”,19 MAR 2021,6797,"One father is learning the lessons forged and carried out by tyrants throughout history… disobey and you will be silenced. Breitbart News reported: Robert Hoogland — the father of a 14-year-old biological female who identifies as transgender and prefers male pronouns — was found in contempt of court and jailed on Tuesday after repeatedly calling his child his “daughter,” despite the court forbidding it, according to a report by the Post Millennial. The Attorney General of British Columbia reportedly issued a warrant for his arrest for contempt. Rob Hoogland was just taken to jail. His crime? Trying to protect his little girl from medical harm. I stand with Robert Hoogland. pic.twitter.com/hC5nrvnUPn — 🅑🅘🅛🅛🅑🅞🅐🅡🅓 🅒🅗🅡🅘🅢  (@christophelston) March 16, 2021 Hoogland is opposed to his teenage daughter going through transgender-related medical procedures, and has repeatedly expressed his opposition in the hopes of saving his child from irreversible damage. The Canadian medical system, the legal system, and the child’s mother, however, have gone forward with the “social and medical transition” of Hoogland’s daughter, the report adds. In December of last year, Hoogland was mandated by British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Francesca Marzari to cooperate in the “transitioning” of his daughter’s sex, and was told not to refer to her as female again. “This could never happen, said those who called my stance against Bill C16 alarmist,” reacted Canadian psychology professor Jordan Peterson. “I read the law and saw that it was, to the contrary, inevitable.” This could never happen, said those who called my stance against Bill C16 alarmist. I read the law and saw that it was, to the contrary, inevitable https://t.co/zi8vB5x4x0 — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) March 18, 2021 Hoogland had previously discovered that his daughter’s school had been showing her sexual and gender identity education materials known as “SOGI 123,” which the report referred to as transgender “propaganda videos.” By the 7th grade, the school had changed his daughter’s name in the yearbook without telling her parents, and “socially transitioned” her with the input of gender ideologue psychologist Wallace Wong, who advised the pubescent child to take testosterone. The report adds that Wong referred Hoogland’s daughter to the endocrinology unit at the local hospital, and that a “treatment” plan was put into action on her first visit. “Here I am, sitting there as a parent, watching a perfectly healthy child be destroyed, and there’s nothing I can do but sit on the sideline — and according to Justice Boden at the time, cheer it on,” Hoogland said in an interview last year. “I can only affirm, or get thrown in jail.” Watch Below: Justice Boden of the British Columbia Supreme Court had reportedly declared that Hoogland and his wife had to affirm their daughter’s new gender identity. Hoogland was told that if he tried to dissuade his daughter or refer to her as a female, then he would be considered guilty of “family violence.” After the ruling, Hoogland gave an interview to the Federalist, in which he lamented the situation, and pointed out that his daughter is biologically female. ""Justice Mazari then summarily convicted Hoogland of family violence on the basis that he had declined to use his child's preferred masculine pronouns."" https://t.co/src7YolVz6 — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) March 18, 2021 After that, Justice Marzari reportedly signed a “protection order” authorizing the police to arrest Hoogland if he were to again be caught referring to his daughter as female, or with female pronouns. Hoogland said that the Marzari ruling even stated that he was allowed to “think thoughts” that were contrary to the Boden ruling. “The court was gracious enough to say that they could not police my thoughts,” Hoogland said. In January of last year, the highest court in British Columbia reportedly declared that the child should continue taking testosterone, and imposed a “conduct order” on Hoogland, mandating that he continue referring to his daughter by male pronouns. ""Hoogland gave interviews to several Canadian commentators. The broadcasts were suppressed by digital platforms, and he was threatened with contempt of court proceedings."" https://t.co/0eElV7iMji — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) March 18, 2021 “They’ve now created a delusion, and they’re forcing parents, like myself, to live in this delusion,” Hoogland said last year. “And then what happens when the bubble explodes, and the delusion ends?” “She can never go back to being a girl,” he added. “I mean, she’ll always be a girl, but she’ll never go back to being a girl in a healthy body that she should have had — she won’t be able to have children, she won’t have a family. These kids don’t understand what this stuff means.” An estimation of more than 80 percent of children with gender dysphoria will end up desisting from their belief that they are the opposite sex once puberty is over. “What kid who’s 13 is thinking about a family and having children? Not many,” Hoogland continued. “What kind of father would I be if, let’s say in five, ten years, my daughter is de-transitioning, and she turns to me and says — ‘Why did none of you do anything to stop this? I was a child. None of you stuck your neck out for me back then.’” “When my daughter asks me that question, I’ll say, ‘I did everything that I possibly could,” he added.

"Psaki Panics, Blame Trump For Kids In Cages As Biden Secretary Pushes “Open Door” Policy",17 MAR 2021,10341,"As over 10,000 children are housed like animals, the Biden Administration is planning a more “open door” policy for migrant invaders. The Western Journal reported: Now that the humanitarian crisis President Joe Biden created on the country’s southern border has the White House on the ropes almost daily, the administration has resorted to blaming the influx of unaccompanied children on former President Donald Trump. Trump, who left office on Jan. 20, of course, left his successor a gift with regard to border enforcement. But Biden’s rhetoric on illegal immigration has seen people stream across the border in record numbers. The once-stable border is now a superhighway for illegal immigration and for children traveling alone. Those who feigned outrage at migrant kids in camps, or “cages” as they called them during the Trump administration, are scrambling for a lifeline as countless are now in the care of Customs and Border Protection, with more arriving every day. This week, Republican lawmakers have finally had enough of the crisis, which could have been avoided. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy actually visited the border near El Paso, Texas, on Monday and pointed the finger at Biden for the quagmire. The GOP is nailing the new president on the matter and is doing so early in his presidency. No person is more desperate to avoid that issue than White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Asked about the crisis by “PBS NewsHour” correspondent Yamiche Alcindor on Monday, Psaki ducked and found a familiar boogeyman: Trump “There were lawyers who interviewed some children that were in facilities. The children described sleeping on the floor, being hungry, not being — not seeing the sun for days,” Alcindor said. “How is that acceptable for the Biden administration to keep children in those sorts of conditions given the fact that you said you were going to be the administration that was going to be more humane than the previous one?” Psaki, according to an official White House transcript, called the situation, which her administration created, “a very emotional issue for a lot of people.” “We are trying to work through what was a dismantled and unprepared system because of the role of the last administration. It’s going to take some time, but we are very clear-eyed about what the problems are and very focused on putting forward solutions,” she said, blaming the Trump administration for the Democrat crisis. Psaki’s answer wasn’t good enough for Alcindor. “But children being hungry, sleeping on the floor, not being allowed outside for days at a time — why is that acceptable to go on even for one more day?” Alcindor asked in a follow-up. “Why is that something that’s not being outlawed right now? How is the administration not stopping that today?” “Well, Yamiche, it’s not acceptable. But I think the challenge here is that there are not that many options.  So the options are — and we have a lot of critics, but many of them are not putting forward a lot of solutions,” Psaki said. “The options here are: Send the kids back on the journey, send them to unvetted homes, or work to expedite moving them into shelters where they can get health treatment by medical doctors, by educational resources, legal counseling, mental health counseling,” she added. “That’s exactly what we’re focused on doing. And this is an across-the-administration effort that we are committed, from the top to making changes on as quickly as possible.” Had Democrats not ramped up their pro-illegal immigration talking points, which the entire world sees and monitors, then there would be no need to find housing, health care and counseling for most of these kids. Children don’t often make decisions to trek across borders ad deserts. Kids are influenced by adults who, in this case, were apparently convinced that the “migrant president,” as Biden is called in Mexico, wants them here amid a global pandemic. Because of the administration’s language, Biden, Psaki and indeed everyone who supported this inept group of people own this crisis. The kids are back in “cages,” and in apparently larger numbers than ever before. Who takes the blame? Trump. The man who worked around the clock to shore up the border, enforce the country’s immigration laws and inherited his own mess from the Obama/Biden administration is a convenient scapegoat for Biden’s administration. But apparently not even the most fervent leftist reporters are ready to buy the line that he’s to blame and simply forget the topic. The border crisis is now brought up with what must be an alarming frequency for a White House with the entire corporate media in its pocket. Still, the administration is attempting to frame its few positives as being an accomplishment for Biden while every crisis is Trump’s fault. That standard applies to the ongoing pandemic, the economy and now to the border. But what Psaki is selling, thus far, is not good enough — not even for a leftist such as Alcindor. The Journal added: Thanks in large part to President Joe Biden’s policies, America is experiencing a crisis at the southwest border. While the Biden administration claims to be taking the situation seriously, it continues to encourage more migrants to flood the border. On Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued a statement addressing the “situation at the southwest border,” as he put it. Instead of admitting that America is unable to process the large influx of migrants, he essentially argued that we should open more doors to let migrants into the country. “For years, the asylum system has been badly in need of reengineering,” he said. “In addition to improving the process by which unaccompanied children are placed with family or sponsors, we will be issuing a new regulation shortly and taking other measures to implement the long-needed systemic reforms,” Mayorkas added. “We will shorten from years to months the time it takes to adjudicate an asylum claim while ensuring procedural safeguards and enhancing access to counsel.” What Mayorkas really means is that the Biden administration wants to make it easier for many migrants to claim asylum in order to cross the border. As Breitbart reported: “Mayorkas is trying to widen various small doors on the border. For example, he is helping many more migrants win claims for asylum by allowing them to seek asylum from routine poverty, political corruption, and street crime commonplace in many countries outside the United States.” Moreover, “The offer of lawyers will lengthen legal disputes and make it difficult for them to be deported. The lawyers will help migrants to stay in the United States for years, even if the asylum claims are weak — and so encourage yet more wage-deflating migration into Americans’ jobs,” the outlet added. Even CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria thinks making it easier to claim asylum is a bad idea. “The truth is the asylum system is out of control,” he said Sunday. “The concept of asylum dates to the years after World War II, when the United States created a separate path to legal status for those who feared religious, ethnic or political persecution — a noble idea born in the shadow of America’s refusal to take in Jews in the 1930s.” While the asylum system was originally used “sparingly,” Zakaria said that the system is now being abused to give certain migrants “special consideration” without having to go through the traditional legal process of immigration. Of course, Zakaria had to put his liberal spin on things. Instead of actually addressing the fact that Biden’s administration wants to make asylum claims even more mainstream, he attempted to shift the focus onto former President Donald Trump, who he blamed for “attacking Biden on this issue.” The fact is that Trump is right to attack Biden on this issue. The Biden administration’s soft immigration policies have contributed to our border crisis, and yet it continues to pursue policies that will only worsen the situation. In his Tuesday statement, Mayorkas tried to shift blame onto Mexico for the crisis. He said the United States is attempting to expel most migrants apprehended at the border, with the exception of unaccompanied children, but Mexico is sometimes unable to accommodate them. “Single adults from other countries are expelled by plane to their countries of origin if Mexico does not accept them,” he said. “Families from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries are expelled to Mexico unless Mexico does not have the capacity to receive the families. … When Mexico’s capacity is reached, we process the families and place them in immigration proceedings here in the United States.” Mayorkas is attempting to convince Americans that it is not Biden’s policies, but rather Mexico’s lack of compassion for those expelled from the United States, that is forcing his hand. Breitbart called this “an excuse to import the poor migrants,” which the administration wanted to do anyway. In addition, the Biden administration is contributing to deteriorating conditions in Central American countries, as a separate Breitbart article pointed out. “Biden’s promises are just the latest stage in the multi-decade campaign by allied progressives and Wall Street investors to overcome the public’s migration preferences,” the outlet reported. “That long campaign has fractured and loopholed what once was expected by the public to be an orderly legal immigration system for legal migrants from south of the U.S. border. What is left is a de facto obstacle course migration system for blue-collar migrants.” Breitbart compared a migrant’s path to the United States to the dystopian series “The Hunger Games.” In addition to putting the migrants themselves at risk, the policies also hurt the migrants’ countries of origin. “The progressives’ Hunger Games also cripple the economies of migrant-sending countries because they are extracting workers, consumers, investments, political pressures, and expectations of growth,” Breitbart said. Progressives claim that their immigration policies are born out of compassion. However, the effects are deleterious to America, migrants and the countries from which the migrants come. Despite what Mayorkas’ statement may say, the crisis at the border will not be solved by increasingly soft immigration policies."
Manslaughter Probe Begins In Italy After COVID Vaccine Death,17 MAR 2021,6500,"The Astra-Zeneca COVID vaccine is apparently so deadly that Italy has opened a manslaughter case. The New York Post reported: Prosecutors in Italy have launched a manslaughter investigation after a music teacher there died hours after getting the controversial AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Sandro Tognatti, 57, got jabbed in his hometown of Biella on Saturday afternoon and went to bed that night with a high fever, his wife, Simona Riussi, told Italian media. She called an ambulance the next morning but the clarinetist could not be saved, she said. Prosecutors in the northern Italian region of Piedmont opened the probe into his death later that day, according to the Italian wire service Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA). They also seized nearly 400,000 shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the same batch. So far, officials have insisted there has yet to be a direct link between Tognatti’s death and his shot. The criminal investigation is to be “completely sure” that the death “cannot be attributed to the above-mentioned inoculation,” prosecutor Teresa Angela Camelio said in a statement. Italy on Monday joined a growing group of mostly European nations temporarily suspending the UK vaccine amid alarming reports of blood clots in some participants. They were joined Monday by France and Germany, with the likes of Ireland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Thailand having already suspended its use. AstraZeneca — which developed the shot with Oxford University — says the vaccine is safe, an assertion backed up by the World Health Organization. The vaccine has yet to be approved for use in the US — but the drugmaker is reportedly pushing for emergency-use approval by the end of this month. The Daily Mail added: Italian prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation today after a music teacher died on Sunday – a day after receiving AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine. The judiciary in Biella, in northern Italy, opened a preliminary probe into the death of 57-year-old Sandro Tognatti, whose cause of death remains unknown. They stressed that there is no link to AstraZeneca’s vaccine at this stage and the probe is intended to establish whether anyone has a case to answer. It came as Italians woke up to fresh lockdown restrictions today, with 13 of the country’s 20 regions now in a ‘red zone’ meaning schools, restaurants, shops and museums have to close, and people cannot leave their homes except for work, health or other essential reasons. Another seven regions have been declared ‘orange zones’, meaning shops and beauticians can remain open except during a night-time curfew, while all other venues have to close and travel outside the local area is restricted. Just one region, Sardinia, is in a lockdown-free ‘white zone’. Italy also temporarily banned the use of all AstraZeneca vaccines amid fears it causes blood clots, with France and Germany also enacting bans and saying they are waiting for European regulators to give guidance. The European Medicines Agency said last week that there is no reason to halt use of the jab and that ‘the benefits outweigh the risks of side effects’, but its investigation is continuing and another report is due Thursday. It comes after Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Bulgaria also suspended the jabs. Austria, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have impounded one batch of vaccines thought to be linked to clots. It is just the latest episode in a long-running saga between EU countries and drug-maker AstraZeneca over its vaccine, which has seen ministers accuse the company of nationalism, impose export bans on its jabs, wrongly claim it is not effective in over-65s and reopen old wounds with recently-departed Brexit Britain. Europe’s move to ban the jabs also comes despite a third wave of Covid infections building on the continent, with leaders forced to reimpose lockdowns because large portions of their populations remain unprotected. Doctors in Germany warned the country needs an ‘immediate’ return to lockdown to avoid a ‘strong third wave’, just weeks after measures started easing. Paris was also teetering on the brink of tougher measures after intensive care units there overflowed, forcing hospital to evacuate Covid patients by helicopter to neighbouring regions where beds are available. Covid cases are also rising sharply across other European countries including the likes of Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands and Sweden. It comes after one health worker died and three more got sick from clots shortly after taking the vaccine, though the European Medicines Authority, the World Health Organization and AstraZeneca all insist the vaccine is safe. Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon both threw their weight behind the jab on Monday, insisting it is safe and effective, while leaders in France and Italy also gave their backing. The ban in the Netherlands comes as voters deliver their verdict on the country’s coronavirus response on the first of three days of balloting in a snap election, weeks after a curfew led to several nights of rioting in major cities. While Dutch authorities said it was ‘wise to press the pause button now as a precaution’, a series of top UK officials have rejected fears over the Oxford jab, saying the risks of Covid-19 are greater than those of vaccination. In Ireland, health officials said there had been a ‘small number of reports’ of blood clots but none of them as serious as those described in Norway. Irish authorities had recently been pushing AstraZeneca to speed up its vaccine supplies to the Republic, where 117,500 doses of the jab have been used so far. A government plan to speed up the roll-out anticipates around 50,000 people per week getting the AstraZeneca shot from April to June. Ronan Glynn, Ireland’s deputy chief medical officer, said he hoped the delay would last only a week – with lockdown exit plans depending on the vaccine drive. ‘We have a safety signal and when we get those we have to act and proceed on the basis of a precautionary principle,’ he said. ‘So hopefully, as this week goes on, we’ll get more reassuring data from the EMA and we can recommence the programme. ‘It may be nothing, we may be overreacting, and I sincerely hope that in a week’s time we are accused of being overcautious.’ Meanwhile the UK has brushed off the concerns on the continent, with ministers saying that ‘all is well’ after the tally of people with a first dose passed 24million."
Red States Should Copy Blue States Nullifying Federal ‘Law’ Now,16 MAR 2021,5986,"As Americans continue to see the Biden ‘Administration’s’ illegal and unprecedented destruction of the constitution, many people argue that it’s time red states did something that blue states have been doing for years… nullify and ignore the federal government. In order to prevent a full communist takeover, it must happen now. The American Thinker explained: As we all know, the last election was a  “tipping point” election on many different levels. An election won with the use of illegal last-minute changes to state election laws has led to a rogue regime that threatens the very foundations of America.  This is being achieved through highly questionable executive orders, the decimation of the concept of national sovereignty and an attack on fossil fuels, the lifeblood of our economy.  Moreover, Biden is converting our military into a social justice agency and transforming our intelligence services into witch-hunters for conservatives who dared to protest a stolen election. More alarming is the left’s goal to make its political power permanent by granting amnesty to 20-30 million illegal aliens, granting statehood to D.C. and Puerto Rico, expanding the Supreme Court, and normalizing the censorship of conservatives, not to mention the institutionalizing of election fraud, especially in key swing states. There is little doubt, if history is our guide, that should the left achieve permanent political  power, future elections will just become  “show” elections, our 1st and 2nd Amendment rights will be diminished, if not gutted, and our economy will become permanently stagnant as with all other socialist economies in the world.   It will be the beginning of the end of America as we know it. A proposal to challenge this attack on our rights Our Founders, however, were extremely wary of federal power and thus created a number of checks and balances to counter it.  One of them was the ability by the states to “nullify” federal laws and even Supreme Court decisions.   As most conservatives  know, nullification is when a State decides to not abide by a federal law, regulation or even a Federal court ruling by simply refusing to enforce it.  This concept is rooted in the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which plainly states that if the states, who are the creators of the federal government, have not specifically given them authority, that authority rests with the states and the people of the state: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Over the last 150 years or so, liberal legislators and judges have violated the Tenth Amendment by illegally expanding the scope and power of the federal government. We know that Federal power is limited because such powers were actually “enumerated” or listed in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution and include actions  such as  “To lay and collect taxes,”  “coin money,” and   “raise and support Armies.”  The federal government was not given any role in education, health, welfare, transportation, energy, or even with maintaining secure borders.  All those issues were left up to the states to decide. If our founders wanted to expand the federal government into every area of our life, they would not have specifically listed the very few powers they granted it. Conservative constitutional scholars such as Thomas E. Woods, in his book, Nullification, How to Resist Federal Tyranny in the 21st Century, documents that our Founders believed that if a “law is unconstitutional and therefore void and of no effect, it is up to the states, the parties to the federal compact, to declare it so and thus refuse to enforce it.” The left will scream about such nullification efforts, but they have been engaged in nullifying federal laws for years.  For example, all state laws legalizing marijuana are illegal since they’re  in conflict with federal narcotic laws, but states have simply refused to enforce these federal laws and so have “nullified” them.  Likewise,  states controlled by the left have allowed various cities and counties to become “sanctuaries” in which they refused to abide by federal immigration laws.  And no, the Marines were not sent in nor did any state or city even suffer the loss of federal funding. It is time our side use this tactic as a way of protecting our constitutional rights. Here are some of the issues that could be affected by the concept of nullification: Of course, states will be reluctant to invoke nullification but the alternative would be to watch our constitutional rights be trashed by leftists.  The MAGA movement in the Red States needs to became active in urging legislators and governors to start reclaiming their constitutional powers and begin nullifying illegal Federal law. Once states are engaged in nullifying federal laws, I believe we will witness what I call the “great migration” in which conservatives will leave blue states to live in red states and vice-versa.  And yes, this could lead to a peaceful balkanization of America in which the Red states become redder and the Blue states become bluer, but this is not our fault.  It is the left that is  assaulting our constitutional rights and if conservatives desire to live in states that protect their rights, then so be it. Already, we are seeing some movement in the states on the nullification front. The Arizona Senate passed a bill that declares it will not enforce federal gun control laws. Oklahoma, South Dakota and North Dakota legislators have all introduced legislation that nullifies Biden’s executive orders. Nullification is simply returning America to its original system of governance in which most governmental authority is decentralized to the states and counties. The federal government can’t do much about it other than to cut federal funding for some state programs, but perhaps the time has come for states to do away with these federal handcuffs."
Biden To Cage 3000 ‘Teens’ In Dallas Convention Center As Another 4200 Children Housed Like Animals,16 MAR 2021,3920,"The ‘Hi’den administration is caging children like dogs, yet no media outlet or ‘concerned’ democrat has said a word about it. Now, another 3000 “teens” are headed to Dallas, while 4,200 other children are houses like animals. Newsmax reported: The U.S. government plans to use the downtown Dallas convention center to hold up to 3,000 immigrant teenagers as sharply higher numbers of border crossings have severely strained the current capacity to hold youths, The Associated Press has learned. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center will be used for up to 90 days beginning as early as this week, according to written notification sent to members of the Dallas City Council and provided to The Associated Press. Federal agencies will use the facility to house boys ages 15 to 17, according to the memo, which describes the soon-to-open site as a “decompression center.” U.S. Health and Human Services is rushing to open facilities across the country to house immigrant children who are otherwise being held by the U.S. Border Patrol, which is generally supposed to detain children for no more than three days. The Border Patrol is holding children longer because there is next to no space in the HHS system, similar to the last major increase in migration two years ago. A tent facility operated by the Border Patrol in Donna, some 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Midland, is holding more than 1,000 children and teenagers, some as young as 4. Lawyers who inspect immigrant detention facilities under a court settlement say they interviewed children who reported being held in packed conditions in the tent, with some sleeping on the floor and others not able to shower for five days. HHS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the city of Dallas said the city was preparing a comment on the agreement. HHS also said it will house immigrant youths in Midland. Teenagers began arriving Sunday at a converted camp for oilfield workers where volunteers from the American Red Cross will care for them. Neither HHS nor the Red Cross would detail how the volunteers have been trained or whether they have undergone FBI fingerprint checks. The Red Cross said in a statement that it was working with HHS to “orient our volunteers.” “HHS will utilize all available options to care for the children referred to us safely,” the agency said in a statement. BuzzFeed News first reported the opening of the Midland facility. The surge at the U.S.-Mexico border has presented a major test for President Joe Biden’s administration, which promised to break from the more restrictive measures against migrants enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden has left in place some Trump policies, notably the expulsions of immigrant adults and families under a public-health declaration citing the coronavirus pandemic. Biden declined to reinstate public-health expulsions of children, and his administration has also been unable to expel many families in South Texas due to policy changes in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state, across from the Texas Rio Grande Valley. Border agents are apprehending more than 400 children a day on average, far more than the number of children that HHS is processing and releasing to sponsors. The Biden administration has announced several policy changes to try to expedite releases, but experts and immigration lawyers say the government could do more to speed up the process, particularly of releasing children to their parents in the U.S. © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

The Gateway Pundit added: The Biden administration is now holding over 4,200 kids in “jail-like” stations where they can only bathe once a week and are reportedly not allowed to call their parents.

Kenneth Harrelson, a 100% disabled veteran, who traveled to Washington D.C. to on Jan. 5-6, to protect Trump supporters from violent Antifa. We have a 17-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter. My husband was arrested on Wednesday, March 10th, 2021 and my family is greatly in need of help. The FBI, city police and sheriff’s office came to our home and executed a search warrant. My husband was on a ladder cleaning the gutters at the time and I was inside working virtually at my job. The agents and officers approached with their guns pointed at my husband. He was unarmed and was in fear for his life. They arrested him without incident and then came to the door with my husband in handcuffs. I was on the phone with a customer at the time. I immediately hung up and then notified my boss that I needed to be excused from work for the day due to a family emergency. The agents informed me that they were going to search the house and said that I would need to remain outside for the duration of their search. I requested to see a copy of the search warrant but I was refused, basically. They proceeded to escort me outside of my home. I was upset that my things were going to be tossed around everywhere and that they would make a huge mess. They even tried to search through my photo album of my recently deceased Mother’s photos, until I begged them not to. I decided to video record them while they conducted their search and I let them know that I was recording. They started questioning Kenneth but he requested a lawyer and so questioning ended and they then transported him to the county jail. I stayed at home to await the arrival of our children from school. After they completed their search, they gathered their “evidence,” which included absurd things like our son’s Air-soft flash-bangs and Air-soft “grenades” that he uses to play Air-soft with his JROTC school friends. They also took a tourniquet that we keep on hand, along with other first aid supplies. I was formally trained as an EMT and as a Certified Nursing Assistant, therefore, I keep this kind of supplies on hand at all times. They also took my personal iPad. All of these things were here at home while Kenneth was in Washington, D.C. and have nothing to do with his trip there. I immediately began searching for a lawyer. The fee just to retain a local lawyer is $2,500 and it will cost $100,000 if Kenneth is indicted on felony charges. My family does not have this kind of money. I was not able to access Kenneth’s VA disability funds because my name was not listed on his account, and it has now been locked down. I scraped up just enough money to pay the initial attorney retainer fee, this month’s bills and enough groceries to get us through the next couple of weeks. I was let go from my job because of this. I am at a total loss about what to do to get next month’s bills paid and to put food on the table for our kids and me. Included in the Affidavit was mention of Go To Meetings that Kenneth participated in. The discussions that took place on those calls were about things the members could do to protect people from harm, specifically from violent ANTIFA. There was no conspiracy to harm anyone, only to protect people. The Oath Keepers have spent the past few months discussing ways to keep their communities informed about the violent activities of the BLM and ANTIFA groups, and also prepared to defend their neighborhoods and homes from invasion by those often violent, extremists. The Oath Keepers are made up of a diverse group of people; a variety of skin colors and races. They all have a common goal of defending the United States Constitution. Included in their mission is protecting and serving the community. They have spent countless volunteer hours helping with natural disasters cleanup and getting food and supplies to people in need. They also protect people at rallies, and that is why my husband traveled to Washington D.C. The Oath Keepers are not terrorists. I pray that the truth will eventually set them all free. I hope that people will come forward and let everyone know that they were in DC on Jan 5-6 to show support for President Trump and to provide security for the guest speakers at the Save America Rally, as well as protecting the people in the audience. After the speeches wrapped up, they helped escort members of the Stop the Steal group (including senior citizens) down to the Capitol, where there was supposed to be another scheduled speaking event outside the building. They had absolutely no advance knowledge that anyone was going to enter the Capitol building. They first learned of it when they saw it with their own eyes. They proceeded towards the building to offer assistance to the police officers and to those who were being pepper-sprayed and at risk of being trampled by the crowd. I have been suffering physically and emotionally over this whole situation. The horrible things that are being said about my husband and other Oath Keepers members is devastating and heartbreaking. One of the worst lies being spread about them is that they are somehow “white supremacists.” That is insulting and ridiculous. I’m Cajun, and therefore my ancestors and family members are black as well as American Indian. I have nieces and nephews who are mixed races (black, Indian, white, etc). Also I am partial Native American Indian. And I know that the national Vice President of Oath Keepers is a black cop from Montana, and their team leader in DC was a black Army combat veteran and former cop. Calling them “racists” is a disgraceful insult to me, my family, and to all the Oath Keepers. The Oath Keepers are all a bunch of good people and true patriots who are passionate about their love for our great country. I am in total disbelief that my husband, the father of my kids, who is an honorable Retired US Army Veteran is currently sitting in jail. My husband is a wonderful man, as are the other Oath Keepers who have been arrested and charged with these ridiculous charges. I demand for their release and believe that focus should be shifted to actual criminals such as those who are burning down cities and murdering people. I am not affiliated with any political party because of situations like this. I don’t feel like I can always trust the government to do the right thing, such as protect the good citizens and punish the ones who deserve to be punished. I would not wish this situation on anyone, not even my worst enemy. This is the most horrible thing next to losing my mother not long ago. Our children are straight-A students who have learned the value of family and of being responsible citizens. Our family are the kind of people who would do whatever we can to help others. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. And I am scared. I currently have no personal protection, but the Oath Keepers have volunteered to send men to protect me if needed. We are being harassed by social media, news media and I fear an attack by an angry mob. I feel a sense of blame towards the government for not being here for my family after my husband gave so much of himself serving to defend and protect our country while in the Army. We are potentially going to lose our home and our vehicle. Our children are going to go without basic needs, possibly including food and healthcare. My husband is sitting in jail on a US Marshals hold and could be extradited to Washington, D.C. after his hearing on Monday. He suffers from several health issues including severe high blood pressure, PTSD, a hormone imbalance and a painful back injury. He was medically retired out of the Army and has had to endure two back surgeries and a shoulder surgery. He is only 40 years old and I am afraid that the trauma and stress brought about by this situation will cause his health to further decline. I’m afraid that I might lose him. I am trying to raise funds to pay for legal fees, bills and groceries. I have found an attorney in Washington, D.C. but as of now, cannot afford the $100,000 that it will cost for him to defend Kenneth if he is indicted on felony charges. My husband is a kind man who will give the shirt off his back to anyone in need, no matter their color or race. He often helps people without ever accepting payment because helping others is his reward. Anyone and everyone who knows him knows that he is not a terrorist, just a genuine American patriot. The TRUTH WILL PREVAIL.
Sincerely, Angel Harrelson"
Must Watch Video List Of Vaccine Facts: Before You Accept Global ‘Jab’,12 MAR 2021,3588,"If you haven’t taken the Bill Gates/China vaccine yet, watch the following videos.

Just watch as many as you need to feel convinced… If your job is pressuring you to get the vaccine then perhaps you should see a private GP doctor, get a doctors note for covid related mental health problems, and go on sick leave for a while. This is a fair thing to do since the medical tyranny of being forced to take dangerous substances is not acceptable.

"Biden’s “Fake” Speech Is Totalitarian Dream: Citizens Told What They Can Do, When and Where",12 MAR 2021,7089,"Last night, a carefully scripted (under 30 minute) appearance of Joe Biden was broadcast, telling American citizens that they don’t have the freedom to do as they like on the holiday of our Independence. Tucker Carlson unloaded on the disconnect between the people controlling puppet Biden and the American citizen. Just the News reported: In a primetime address on the pandemic’s first anniversary, President Biden told Americans that if they do their part there’s a possibility they can gather with friends and family members for barbecues by Independence Day. But in a nation deeply divided over how people should conduct their lives amidst COVID-19, the president’s remarks quickly came under scrutiny amid the ongoing debate between advocates of a more robust nanny state versus those who are eager to return to pre-Covid normalcy. “This is a free people, this is a free country, how dare you tell us who we can spend the Fourth of July with,” conservative commentator Tucker Carlson said on his Fox News program not long after Biden had concluded his speech. “He can wait for Independence Day to meet his three best friends on the White House lawn but most of us aren’t living that way,” author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson said during an interview on Carlson’s program. “It was a bizarro speech … in this bizarro world where we’re all still desperately afraid of the coronavirus, where cases haven’t fallen 90% since January and hospitalizations 70%, where, you know, we know exactly who’s at risk from this and how most of us are at very, very low to no risk from this,” Berenson said. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also characterized the speech as “bizarre.” “That was the most bizarre speech from any US President I’ve ever seen. Does Biden know about all the open states? He says everyone must get the vaccine & we might get to have a BBQ with our families on July 4th. Should we tell him most of us have been doing that the past year?” the Georgia Republican tweeted. That was the most bizarre speech from any US President I’ve ever seen.Does Biden know about all the open states?He says everyone must get the vaccine & we might get to have a BBQ with our families on July 4th.Should we tell him most of us have been doing that the past year?— Marjorie Taylor Greene  (@mtgreenee) March 12, 2021 GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted: “If you’re waiting for permission from the chief executive to celebrate Independence Day with your family, you clearly don’t grasp the concept of Independence.” During the speech Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated and said that he would instruct states, tribes and territories to make all adults eligible for vaccination no later than May 1. “First, tonight I’m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults — people 18 and over —  eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1,” the president said. This “doesn’t mean everyone’s gonna have that shot immediately,” he explained, though people can “get in line beginning May 1” and all adults will be eligible for vaccination. “I need you to get vaccinated when it’s your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated as well,” Biden said. “Because here’s the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th there’s a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together. After this long, hard year that will make this Independence Day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus,” the president said. The Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that individuals who have been completely inoculated can visit with other vaccinated individuals inside. It also states that those who have been vaccinated can “Visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.” “So Biden says that if we’re good little boys and girls, we can get together in small groups by July 4,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted, while pointing to the CDC recommendations. “In other words, he’s promising something by JULY that we’re already doing today. And the CDC guidance is already too restrictive by an order of magnitude. But I guess we’re supposed to be grateful for any crumbs of liberty offered by his beneficent hand,” Shapiro wrote.

But I guess we’re supposed to be grateful for any crumbs of liberty offered by his beneficent hand.— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) March 12, 2021 The Gateway Pundit added: Joe Biden delivered his very first address as US President on the anniversary of the COVID lockdowns. Virtually no one tuned in to the White House’s YouTube channel to watch dementia Joe speaks gibberish for 20 minutes. Joe Biden’s doom and gloom speech was not inspiring at all. He lied about Trump and threatened Americans with indefinite lockdowns if we don’t wear masks and maintain social distancing. Biden actually believes he has the authority to tell Americans who we can spend the Fourth of July with. “If we do our part… by July 4, there’s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day… Small groups will be able to get together,” said Biden. But then Biden threatened to take it all away if “we don’t stay vigilant.” “If we don’t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track,” Biden said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson went off on Joe Biden. “How dare you tell us who we can spend the Fourth of July with,” Tucker said. The hallway looked like it was from the House of Mirrors.

Socialist San Francisco Pays $5000 A Month For Each Homeless Tent: No Wonder COVID Bailout Passed,11 MAR 2021,2563,"The homeless tents that now have spread across San Francisco are costing taxpayers $5000 per month. That’s right… double or triple the cost of an apartment. The Blaze reported: The City by the Bay has been dealing with serious homelessness for years, and during the pandemic things have gotten markedly worse. San Francisco has gone beyond having its everyday poop-in-the-streets problem and rampant drug and alcohol abuse among its homeless population — which, by the way, was enabled when the city’s health department announced it would provide free drugs and alcohol to homeless people staying at city-leased hotels in order to keep them from breaking pandemic quarantine requirements. Now the city is realizing the financial hit it is taking with the longstanding homeless camps it authorized last May with its “safe-sleeping villages” as the state shuttered indoor homeless facilities. The villages are a network of tent encampments spread across the city that were OK’d at the same time that it began placing hundreds of homeless in hotel rooms and RVs, MarketWatch reported last spring. Now the financial chickens are coming home to roost. The 262 tents housing about 300 people in the six tent villages set up around the city to shelter people during the pandemic who might otherwise sleep on the streets are costing taxpayers a pretty penny, KTLA-TV reported last Thursday. San Francisco is spending $16.1 million annually on these villages, which breaks down to $61,450 per tent — or $5,120 a month for each tent. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, KTLA said, the average cost per night is less than what the city has been paying to put the homeless up in hotels. However, the hotel program is eligible for federal reimbursement while the tent villages are not, which means the people of San Francisco and their fellow Californians are on the hook for the entire expensive camping program that their city fathers came up with. From KTLA: But the tent program isn’t eligible for federal reimbursement. Some lawmakers say the program is too expensive, especially when the city is facing a projected $650 million budget deficit over the next two years.
“It’s eye-popping, and we need to understand why that is,” Supervisor Rafael Mandelman said. “We have to find a way to have exits from the streets. But we need them to be more cost-effective.”
The program is funded by state and city money and revenue from a 2018 business tax. According to officials, the heavy financial hit is due largely to the city not doing “a more thorough bidding process.”"
"Compare: Biden Vs. Trump, Dems Last Ditch Effort Involves “Hologram”",11 MAR 2021,3322,"Joe Biden is a puppet, controlled by China (who controls his handlers). The evidence is overwhelming that he was not elected. Compare his most recent ‘appearance’ with President Trump. Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Summit News reported: On Wednesday, Joe Biden once again stumbled and murmured through an event watched by virtually no one, then refused to answer any questions from journalists about when on earth he is going to hold a press conference. Only around 1000 people bothered to tune into the White House stream of Biden “talking” with the CEOs of vaccine manufacturers: Fifty days into his presidency, Joe Biden still hasn’t held a press conference, and reporters are losing patience. When the talk ended, the press began yelling questions, including asking when he would bother to talk to them: Biden said he wanted to save the world, then sloped off. The 78-year-old’s habit of stumbling through sentences and forgetting words and names has left staffers keen to keep Biden away from reporters, and there has even been a far-fetched suggestion that he could be replaced by a hologram. As we highlighted yesterday, Biden’s handlers almost had panic attacks when journalists began asking him questions during a visit to a hardware store in DC. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has been handling important phone calls with foreign leaders, a task normally undertaken by the president. A Rasmussen poll found that half of Americans now have questions regarding Joe Biden’s physical and mental fitness, while more than half are concerned about the fact that he has not held a press conference since taking office. The Gateway Pundit added: Joe Biden mumbled through a prepared COVID speech on Wednesday from the White House. Only 1,049 people watched his speech live on the White House Channel. After Joe Biden’s low-energy speech he shuffled away as reporters shouted questions. After having held zero press conferences since taking office, Joe Biden fled the podium and ignored questions about when he will hold a press conference. Biden talked about Covid vaccines but he ignored questions about when he will hold a press conference. Last week White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Joe Biden will hold a full press conference by the end of the month. It has been 50 days since Joe Biden was sworn into office after stealing the 2020 election and he still hasn’t held a press conference or given a State of the Union Address and the media thinks this is totally normal. Joe Biden can hardly string a sentence together because of his severe cognitive decline, but the media keeps covering for him. The Gateway Pundit reported: Joe Biden mumbled through a prepared COVID speech on Wednesday in the White House. Only 1,049 people watched his speech live on the White House Channel. This is such a complete joke what these people are feeding the American people. Joe Biden can’t fill a gymnasium. He has less charisma than a turnip. He has to read every single word from his TelePrompter or sound like a bumbling idiot. But he got 81 million votes? What a complete crock. And, of course, Biden did not give President Trump a single “thank you” for leaving him with a vaccine for the coronavirus? UPDATE: And an hour after his prepared speech Joe Biden only has 1.4 thousand retweets!"
"CDC Claims Vaccinated People Still Need Masks In Public, But Not In Homes?",9 MAR 2021,3028,"For the sheep who’ve been vaccinated, the CDC has issued new guidelines allowing them to ‘resume’ personal liberty inside their own homes. The Epoch Times reported: People who are fully vaccinated can now gather indoors without masks or social distancing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its new guidance on Monday. “There are some activities that fully vaccinated people can begin to resume now in their own homes,” CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky said in a press release. “Taking steps towards relaxing certain measures for vaccinated persons may help improve COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake.” People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after getting the second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or two weeks after the single-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The CDC says that fully vaccinated people do not have to wear a mask or physically distance themselves from others who are also fully vaccinated or those who are unvaccinated but “are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease.” They also do not need to be tested or quarantined if they are asymptomatic following exposure to individuals confirmed or suspected of COVID-19, the disease caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus. But this does not apply to those who’ve been fully vaccinated in group homes, prisons, and other “non-healthcare congregate settings” since they “may face high turnover of residents, a higher risk of transmission, and challenges in maintaining recommended physical distancing.” Other fully vaccinated people should also isolate and get tested if they have symptoms and signs consistent with COVID-19 since they could still spread the CCP virus to other people, according to the CDC. Investigations are still ongoing on whether fully vaccinated people can transmit the virus and if they are less likely to experience an asymptomatic infection. The federal agency says that fully vaccinated persons should continue to practice preventative measures such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, and frequent hand washing when in public or visiting unvaccinated individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness. As for traveling, Walensky says the CDC maintains its current guidance that people should avoid “non-essential” travel. “Every time that there’s a surge in travel, we have a surge of cases in this country,” Walensky said at a press briefing today. “We are really trying to restrain travel at this current period of time, and we’re hopeful that our next set of guidance will have more science around what vaccinated people can do, perhaps travel being among them.” Walensky says that the guidance will continue to be updated as “more people get vaccinated and the science and evidence expands, and as the disease dynamics of the country change.” She also said, as of Monday “59 million people in the United States have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and approximately 31 million or 9.2 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.”"
Bill Gates Foundation Mining DNA Data Under Cover of COVID Tests,8 MAR 2021,4527,"Apparently, that anal swab COVID test is also providing a rich mine of genetic information for Gates et.al. The National Pulse reported: The company has recently come under fire following a 60 Minutes exposé on the company’s use of COVID-19 tests to “collect, store and exploit biometric information” on American citizens, according to former U.S. intelligence officials. What’s more, a recent Reuters article linked the firm to the Chinese Communist Party’s military. In addition to the Obama administration enabling the firm to gain a foothold in the U.S., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation played a critical role in BGI’s American expansion. In September of 2012, the Microsoft founder’s foundation signed a “Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to form a collaboration on global health and agricultural development with the goal of achieving common objectives in health and agricultural development.” The co-founder of BGI praised the agreement, celebrating the forthcoming “scientific breakthroughs in the areas of human, plant and animal genomics.” He also revealed that the collaborative efforts focused on sequencing genomes—the precise activity flagged for national security threats in the 60 Minutes segment: “Having contributed to the Human Genome Project as well as sequencing the genomes of many critical plant and animal species and human diseases, including the initial sequencing of the rice genome as well as our involvement in the Rice 10,000 Genome Project, the 1,000 Plants and Animals Genome Project, the International 1,000 genomes project, the 1,000 Rare Diseases Project, the International Cancer Genome Project, Autism Genome 10K, among others, BGI looks forward to partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in this significant collaboration to apply genomics research to benefit global human health.” The memorandum predates Gates’s 2010 visit to BGI’s China-based headquarters, where he witnessed the company’s genetic sequencing operation as described by the Financial Times: In 2010, Bill Gates visited an unremarkable building in an industrial estate on the outskirts of Shenzhen, China. With row after row of high-tech machinery humming inside, the place could easily be mistaken for an anonymous data warehouse. But Mr Gates and Ray Yip, head of the Gates Foundation’s China operation, saw something else that day. As they toured the BGI headquarters, the two men were stunned by the ambition of the scientists working at the biotech company. Inside, more than 150 state of the art genetic sequencing machines were analysing the equivalent of thousands of human genomes a day. The company is working towards a goal of building a huge library based on the DNA of many millions of people. BGI executives see this not as the end-game, but as the springboard for new drug discoveries, advanced genetic research and a transformation of public health policy. Yip praised the endeavor as “out-of-the-box,” “open,” and “liberal”: “We were taken aback. We never thought we would find such an out-of-the-box approach. They are in their own league — open and liberal. Most people only see them as a service provider for DNA analysis. It is the database they are building that will make them formidable.” The Gates Foundation has also funded BGI projects relating to genome sequencing alongside Chinese Communist Party bodies such as the Ministry of Science and Technology and Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Similarly, Dr. Tadataka Yamada, the former president of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s global health program, serves as the Chairman of BGI’s Scientific Advisory Board. And in 2016, BGI launched a U.S.-based office in Washington—the home state of Microsoft and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. BGI’s ties to Washington also appear to have influenced the firm’s decision to target the state with its COVID-19 test kits, part of the company’s plot to “mine” the data of Americans. “Early last March, the state of Washington was the site of the first major coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. As COVID rates and the need for tests were spiking, BGI Group, the world’s largest biotech firm—a global giant based in China—approached the state of Washington with an enticing offer. In a strikingly personal letter to the governor, BGI proposed to build and help run state-of-the-art COVID testing labs,” 60 Minutes summarized. But officials ultimately turned down the offer at the request of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence over BGI’s ties to the Chinese government."
Biden Executive Order ‘Expands’ Voting ‘Rights’ (AKA Fraud) With Stroke Of Pen,8 MAR 2021,3285,"Democrats are determined to never lose control to the American people again. It’s clear because of the voting ‘rights’ laws they are desperate to pass. But Biden is doing it anyway with executive order. Now need for the ‘will of the governed’ anymore. Townhall reported: President Joe Biden on Sunday signed an executive order aimed at expanding voting rights. It’s the Biden administration’s latest move to expand voting rights as they push the Senate to pass H.R. 1, the House Democrats’ bill to radically transform America’s election system, including prohibiting voter ID laws and mandating taxpayers fund political campaigns. “It is the policy of my Administration to promote and defend the right to vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in elections,” the executive order stated. “It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to expand access to, and education about, voter registration and election information, and to combat misinformation, in order to enable all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.” Agency heads will be required to post “relevant information” – like how to vote-by-mail and vote in an upcoming election – on websites and social media platforms. Those who visit vote.gov will be directed to the appropriate state website that provides greater details on how to vote in that individual state. Election officials are encouraged to distribute voter registration and voting-by-mail applications and help voters fill out those applications if need be. The executive order also instructs election officials to “solicit and facilitiat[e] approved, nonpartisan third-party organizations and State officials to provide voter registration services on agency premises.” Federal prisoners who are currently incarcerated with be educated on their voting rights, including whether or not they will be restored once their sentence is completed. Those who are eligible to vote will be registered to do so. The executive order also establishes an “Interagency Steering Group on Native American Voting Rights” aimed at “protecting voting rights of Native Americans.” The committee will include the attorney general, interior secretary, agriculture secretary, labor secretary, health and human services secretary and the VA secretary. Other agencies can be invited as needed. The steering committee’s ultimate goal is to increase voter education, registration and turnout in the Native American communities. Even though Biden wants the Senate to move forward with H.R. 1, a senior White House official told Fox News that the president’s executive order can “stem that tide” of “state voter suppressive action. “When I say that the president urges Congress to take action that would prevent states from attempts at voter suppression, that applies to all states, and it applies to making sure that the federal government and private litigants have the tools necessary to prevent restrictive voting action,” the official said. Republicans have opposed H.R. 1 because of the lack of voting protections, including requiring an ID to vote, and allowing convicted felons to vote once their sentence is completed. Other areas of concern include expanding early voting and voting by mail, something the GOP sees as a hotbed for voter fraud."
"‘Uniparty’ Passes COVID ‘Relief’ Bailing Out Democrat Sates, Funding Enemies, Giving Citizen Pittance",8 MAR 2021,4827,"Good news America, tax money will now bail out failing democrat states thanks to ‘COVID’ and democrat election fraud. Breitbart News reported: Democrat senators celebrated the upper chamber’s passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure on Saturday, framing it as “just the start of what Congress can do” moving forward. The Senate passed the controversial $1.9 coronavirus relief bill on party lines Saturday, 50-49. Republican Rep. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) was not present for the vote, traveling home for a family emergency. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) celebrated the measure’s passage as “historic,” labeling it a “powerful” bill that will “make a real difference.” “This is just the start of what Congress can do for working families. We must raise the minimum wage to $15/hr. We need to invest in infrastructure, k-12 education, and a clean energy economy,” she said, vowing to fight with “every tool in the toolbox to help our families and economy recover”: “The American Rescue Plan has PASSED, Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said, stating that Democrats promised more “shots in people’s arms,” money in people’s pockets,” “children in schools,” and “workers in jobs.” “We’re following through on that promise,” he said: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) described the legislation as “the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country.” “This package, among many other things, increases direct payments by $1400, extends unemployment benefits, reduces child poverty by half, ensures we are vaccinating as many people as possible, and puts us on a path to safely reopen schools,” he remarked: “We just passed a COVID-19 relief bill that will provide immediate support to Arizona working families and small businesses, help reopen schools safely, get vaccines into peoples’ arms, and get our economy back on track,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) said upon the bill’s passing as other Democrat senators celebrated the legislative victory: Republican lawmakers in both chambers have continued to warn against the bill, contending the vast majority of the measure is devoted to issues unrelated to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “I want to put up a chart so you can get a good idea of how little the Democrat bill is actually going to fight the virus. Here’s what 91 percent of the bill, trillions of hardworking taxpayers’ money is funding,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told reporters last week: Nancy Pelosi’s subway, which was increased by another $40 million, but kids are marking the one-year anniversary of not being in school, for a subway just outside her district. That money won’t be held up. Blue state bailouts so they can keep their economy shut down, changing the funding mechanism to reward states that were shut down, Planned Parenthood, universities with massive endowments, Harvard, Harvard with billions of dollars in endowment will get money in this. But to help the children for depression and anxiety, there’s an opportunity to do that. This isn’t a relief bill. It takes care of Democrats’ political allies while it fails to deliver for American families. That is why I’ll be voting no on the Pelosi payoff bill. Less than nine percent of the House-passed bill, he said, will go toward public health. The Conservative Treehouse explained: When Democrats want to pass legislation they will use any method available, including budgetary reconciliation to avoid the legislative threshold.  In an almost identical manner to the creation of Obamacare, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer once again used the ‘reconciliation process’ to initiate another massive expansion of government. Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell pretends to gnash his teeth… WASHINGTON – “[…] The Senate bill includes several changes from the version passed by the House last week. The House’s legislation would have increased the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which the Senate parliamentarian determined violated Senate rules. While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sought to overrule the parliamentarian and pass the minimum wage hike as an amendment to the package Friday, eight Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting against it, a sign that it had no chance of passing. Democrats also agreed to an amendment from Manchin that would provide $300 a week in payments through Sept. 6, rather than the $400 a week through August that the bill originally laid out. The change would also provide up to $10,200 in tax relief for laid off workers for households with incomes under $150,000 a year. House Democrats appear on track to approve the Senate’s changes. […] And centrists, some of whom had been uneasy about the size of the package, are likely to embrace Manchin’s tweaks on unemployment benefits — providing them political cover, as well, to support the final deal.” "
“Woke” Business List Still Demanding ‘Masks’ In Free Texas,5 MAR 2021,6054,"Although a few states have removed their draconian, socialist ‘mandates’ concerning wearing non-effective, dehumanizing masks, a number of businesses refuse to be led astray from the communist ideal. These ‘woke’ enterprises will still be requiring masks on customers in Texas. Trending Politics reported: Major corporations in Texas and Mississippi are reassuring their customers they will continue to enforce mask mandates and other CDC guidelines in reaction to the state governors’ recent announcements. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott led the way, and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves followed soon after, by repealing state-wide mask mandates and lifting lockdown orders on Tuesday. The new state guidelines give businesses the green light to return to 100% capacity. The following 13 major corporations have already released statements or responded to inquiries that confirm their mask mandates and other coronavirus guidelines will continue to be in force despite states lifting their lockdown orders. TARGET “Target will continue requiring guests to wear masks in all of its stores, the company’s spokesman said, adding that the big-box retailer also required all store team members to wear masks at work, and provided them with reusable and disposable masks,” Fox Business reported. STARBUCKS Starbucks will continue to enforce a storewide mask mandate, WSJ reported. “The company is committed to playing a constructive role in supporting health and government officials as they work to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Starbucks said in its July statement. MACY’S “Department store operator Macy’s said its policy of needing customers and workers to wear masks in stores was going to remain unchanged,” Fox Business reported. “Relaxing common-sense safety protocols like wearing masks is a mistake,” said Jason Brewer, vice president of Communications and State Affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Brewer added that undoing the policies would “unfairly put retail employees back in the role of enforcing guidelines still recommended by the CDC and other public health advocates.” TOYOTA “Japanese carmaker Toyota, which has its U.S. headquarters and a factory in Texas, said it was looking into the move by Governor Greg Abbott to roll back the mask mandate and it doesn’t contemplate any immediate changes,” Fox Business reported. HYATT Hyatt, which was recently embarrassed by issuing a statement condemning a fake CPAC scandal, will also continue the hotel chainwide mask mandate, WSJ reported. CVS “CVS, which began mandating masks at all stores nationwide in July as more scientific data emerged showing that face coverings help slow the virus’s spread, will continue to require them, a spokesman said,” WSJ reported. “He said CVS will continue to follow federal health guidelines.” WALGREENS Walgreens will continue to mandate masks, the company said. AMC “America’s largest theater chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., AMC has had all its Texas theaters open since last year. The company will continue to require consumers to wear masks,” WSJ reported. GM “GM, which employs about 13,500 people in Texas, said it would also maintain status quo in the state, with regards to its employees wearing masks,” Fox Business reported. “We’ll keep our COVID-19 safety protocols in place to ensure we continue to protect our employees,” GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE “Alamo Drafthouse’s mandatory mask policy remains in place, as well as our 6′ social distancing protocols, and all of the other safety measures we’ve had in place across the country since last year,” the company said Tuesday. In related news, the New York Post reported that “Alamo Drafthouse revealed it is selling itself as the dine-in cinema chain filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday — and one of its new co-owners is a private-equity firm that has been engulfed in a child-abuse scandal.” ALDI “ALDI will continue requiring customers to wear face masks inside its stores,” a company spokesperson said. ALDI released a statement that said, in part: “For the health and well-being of the communities we serve and for the protection of our employees, we will maintain our current nationwide policy requiring all employees and customers to wear a face covering when shopping in our stores. We will continue to assess any new guidelines issued by the CDC, and will keep our customers informed of any future changes.” H-E-B/Central Market “H-E-B and Central Market will continue requiring masks of employees while “urging” customers to wear them,” ABC reported. “Although there is no longer a statewide mask order, H-E-B believes it is important that masks be worn in public spaces until more Texans and our Partners have access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” the company’s statement read. “As an essential service provider during the pandemic, H-E-B is focused on the health and safety of our Partners and customers. H-E-B will still require all our Partners and vendors to wear masks while at work, and we urge all customers to please wear a mask when in our stores.” KROGER “Masks are required at Kroger grocery stores, according to Kroger Dallas Division corporate affairs manager April Martin,” ABC reported. “To ensure the continued safety of our customers and associates, The Kroger Family of Companies will continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our frontline grocery associates can receive the COVID-19 vaccine,” Martin said. It will be interesting to see how long these businesses maintain their guidelines, as the coronavirus pandemic situation improves, due to natural cycles for such viruses, as well as millions taking the COVID-19 vaccine. A number of their business competitors are eager to return to normal. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, “gym operator Life Time Fitness Inc., Albertsons Cos. and a number of local restaurants plan to stop mandating masks or return to normal capacity, or both.” Not every Texas and Mississippi business is going to be willing to “get Woke, go broke.”"
China Now Using “Emotion Recognition” Programs To Arrest Dissenters,5 MAR 2021,5661,"Many people wonder how long before Chinese communist control comes to America and suspect that it may already be here. Their newest method of identifying people who don’t subscribe to the state beliefs of superiority involves technology that can detect “emotion.” Breitbart News reported: China’s state-run Global Times boasted in an article on Thursday that Chinese people are increasingly becoming accustomed to the use of “emotion recognition technology,” artificial intelligence that allows the government to track human feelings, as part of everyday life. The Global Times illustrated the usefulness of this technology with an example in which police arrest passengers of a car after using artificial intelligence to discover drugs in their car. “Emotion recognition technology” tells the officers that the passengers are more nervous than the average person at a checkpoint, which they use as an excuse to search the car. The notoriously repressive Communist Party is allegedly applying “emotional recognition technology” in “various fields including health, anti-terrorism, and urban security,” according to the Global Times. The development of this technology to criminalize feelings follows increasingly alarming developments in Chinese law enforcement, most recently the revelation that Chinese technology giant Huawei is developing facial recognition technology that can identify a person’s ethnicity, making it easier for Chinese police to persecute members of the Uyghur ethnic minority. Multiple governments around the world, including the current and past administration of the United States, have accused China of committing genocide against the Uyghur people. The Communist Party has built over 1,000 concentration camps in the Uyghurs’ native region, Xinjiang, where survivors say they were forced into indoctrination, slavery, and subject to rape and torture. Of particular concern are reports that China is systematically sterilizing Uyghur women against their will to eliminate the ethnic group, a practice specifically listed in the definition of genocide.
The Communist Party claims that the concentration camps are “vocational training centers” for uneducated people and that all eyewitnesses are liars and paid actors. The Global Times did not specifically mention using “emotion recognition technology” in Xinjiang, but did not that much of the experimentation with the medium appears to be conducted in China on inmates at prisons. At least six prisons are openly using this technology on its inmates to predict which are the most likely to be violent, the newspaper claimed. As China considers any slight or criticism of the Communist Party a crime – often formally identified as “subversion of state power” or “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – many of those experimented on are likely political prisoners. It is also illegal in China to hold religious views outside of the regulation of the state, and only five religions are legal: Taoism, Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestant Christianity. “[I]n China, emotion recognition has contributed to the risk assessment of prisoners in a few regional prisons,” the Global Times noted, citing experimentation in a prison in Guangzhou in 2019. “The technology helps prison officers to evaluate whether a prisoner presents potential risks, including possible mental problems and violent or suicidal tendencies, and estimate whether he or she is likely to repeat an offense after release.” The state propaganda outlet quoted the head of the Guangzhou center conducting the experiments to justify its use, who detailed, “After a prisoner looks at the camera for three to four seconds, this recognition system can know his or her seven main physiological indexes including body temperature, eye movement, and heart rate, and convert them into psychological signs showing whether the prisoner is calm, depressed, angry or whatever else at that time.” Outside of prisons, the state newspaper lauded “emotion recognition technology” for its uses on the road, where police can track the emotions of every driver and stop anyone with “abnormal” feelings. This, it claimed, would help prevent road rage incidents or other potentially criminal behavior. The Global Times cited Chinese “experts” who claimed that Chinese AI could identify a person’s emotions with up to 95-percent accuracy. “Emotion recognition is definitely the direction of humanity’s future tech development,” a “neuromanagement expert” told the newspaper. The technology can work by either monitoring a person’s face for an extended period of time or by forcing individuals to wear devices that track their blood pressure, temperature, and other factors. The Global Times mentioned that, outside of China, the public may express concerns for their privacy and safety in the event that their governments implement this form of AI to monitor their emotions. The Times claimed that the technology is already in use in several states, however, including America, and insisted, citing Chinese government-approved experts, that it is “not an evil ‘mind-reading’ technique.” According to the MIT Technology Review, “emotion recognition technology” was already a $20 billion market in 2019. “The technology is currently being used to assess job applicants and people suspected of crimes, and it’s being tested for further applications, such as in VR headsets to deduce gamers’ emotional states,” the outlet observed at the time, citing a study by AI Now. The study warned that the technology may be particularly problematic when being used across race and gender lines, as its conclusions could “amplify” discrimination.  "
Florida Judge Snatches Kids Away From Mom Because She Won’t ‘Wear Masks’,4 MAR 2021,1329,"Welcome to the new socialist paradise, where if you’re a mother who doesn’t wear a mask, the courts will snatch your kids away. National File reported: Cohen, who was originally appointed by Jeb Bush, indefinitely suspended parental timesharing for Melanie Joseph when he heard that she was seen in a photograph on social media not wearing a mask. Joseph said that she was merely trying to take a break from the mask. Joseph later made an agreement with heavy restrictions (including mandatory vaccinations and a mandate that her asthmatic 14-year old son must wear a mask) to get limited timesharing back. Judge Cohen also completely cut off timesharing for a mother of a less than 2-year old child when a court filing accused the mom of consistently not wearing a mask and photo evidence showed her not social distancing at the beach. “The judge hates me. He feels that I am a COVID denier, and an anti-masker,” Joseph said. “My four other children have been suffering from not being able to see their brother,” Joseph added. “They’ve been mourning him all year.” Judge Dale Cohen also completely cut off parental timesharing for another mother who was accused in court of consistently not wearing a mask, and photographed not social distancing at the beach. That mother eventually made an agreement that came with a gag order."
Microsoft To “BarCode” Kids So They Can “Safely” Return To CA Schools,4 MAR 2021,3553,"Not content with foisting a dangerous vaccination on the general public, Bill Gates’ God-complex has a new outlet… California school kids. They’ll be bar coded so they can return to school. News Punch reported: Microsoft has unveiled a creepy new Covid system that scans school children with a unique barcode so they can attend class. Children in the Los Angeles Unified School District will have their own unique QR code, or “daily pass,” that will be scanned by the system. Students without the barcode will be barred from going into school. Kids will also be forced to social distance, wear masks, and receive regular temperature checks throughout the day. In order for students to earn their safe-for-school Daily Pass, they must answer an online questionnaire and test negative for COVID-19 every single week. NBC Los Angeles reported: “Daily Pass generates a unique QR code for each student and staff member, and that code authorizes entry to a specific LAUSD location for that day only — as long as the individual receives a negative test result for COVID, shows no symptoms, and has a temperature under 100 degrees, the district said.” “Upon the individual’s arrival to a campus, their QR code is scanned by a district school-site leader, who takes the individual’s temperature.” A section on the Daily Pass portal also pressures students and staffers to get vaccinated: “Anonymous data from Daily Pass will be used by the Los Angeles Unified’s research and health care collaborators — Stanford University, UCLA, The Johns Hopkins University, Anthem Blue Cross, Healthnet, and Cedars Sinai — to provide insights for strategies to create the safest possible school environment,” the report continues. Reclaimthenet.org reports: Not only does the system force students in the Los Angeles Unified School District to use this COVID-19 Daily Pass system to gain access to schools but anonymous data from the app will also be used by several Los Angeles Unified research and health care collaborators (Anthem Blue Cross, Cedars Sinai, Healthnet, Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), The Johns Hopkins University) to “provide insights for strategies to create the safest possible school environment.” The explainer video promoting the app positions it as a solution for kids who are scared of getting sick and opens with a fearful cartoon kid character, Racquel Ramirez, telling her mom: “Mom, I’m scared about going back to school. I don’t wanna get sick and I don’t wanna get you and Dad sick.” The COVID-19 Daily Pass is then introduced as a solution for “safely going back to school” and Ramirez is shown happily scanning her QR code entrance ticket to gain entry to the school. The conclusion of the explainer video shows Ramirez finishing her first day back at school with the COVID-19 Daily Pass and telling her Dad: “Dad, I have to admit, I was scared at first but then I felt so safe. It was so good to be back. Thanks for keeping me safe. I love you so much.” The scene plays out with Ramirez’s QR code entrance ticket visible at all times and finishes by zooming in on this QR code. The introduction of this COVID-19 “Daily Pass” app follows similar coronavirus passport systems being introduced around the world where citizens are blocked from entering certain premises or accessing certain services unless they have their digital pass.

Fauci Docs Show He Was “Working” With CCP To Enforce COVID Restrictions On US Citizens,4 MAR 2021,4822,"Anthony Fauci is working for the Chinese Communist Party. DJHJ Media reported: Judicial Watch, a Citizen Watchdog group that file Freedom of Information Lawsuits, released a press statement on Monday about their research that uncovered correspondences from Dr. Anthony Fauci outlining his focus on being in compliance with the Chinese Communist Party and their demands on the USA for COVID restrictions. “These new emails show WHO and Fauci’s NIH special accommodations to Chinese communist efforts to control information about COVID-19,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. From their press release: Judicial Watch announced today that it and the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) received 301 pages of emails and other records of Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showing that National Institutes of Health (NIH) officials tailored confidentiality forms to China’s terms and that the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted an unreleased, “strictly confidential” COVID-19 epidemiological analysis in January 2020. Additionally, the emails reveal an independent journalist in China pointing out the inconsistent COVID numbers in China to NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects Cliff Lane. The emails were obtained in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Judicial Watch on behalf of the DCNF (Daily Caller News Foundation v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (No. 1:20-cv-01149)). The lawsuit was filed after HHS failed to respond to the DCNF’s April 1, 2020, FOIA request seeking: The new emails include a conversation about confidentiality forms on February 14-15, 2020, between Lane and WHO Technical Officer Mansuk Daniel Han. Han writes: “The forms this time are tailored to China’s terms so we cannot use the ones from before.” A WHO briefing package sent on February 13, 2020, to NIH officials traveling to China as part of the COVID response ask that the officials wait to share information until they have an agreement with China: “IMPORTANT: Please treat this as sensitive and not for public communications until we have agreed communications with China.”   In an email dated January 20, 2020, a WHO official discusses the epidemiological analysis they conducted of COVID-19 earlier that month and states that it is “strictly confidential,” is “only for,” the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infection Hazards (STAG-IH), and “should not be further disseminated.” In an email dated March 4, 2020, from Chinese journalist Zeng Jia to Lane, a reporter for Caixin Media, points out to Fauci deputy Cliff Lane that the number of cases reported in the WHO Joint China Mission’s report are inconsistent with the number reported by the Wuhan Public Health Committee: It says on Page 6 [in the WHO report] that there was at least one clinically diagnosed case of coronavirus on December 2th, 2019, in Wuhan; and from Jan 11th to 17th there were new clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases every day in Wuhan, which is not consistent with Wuhan Public Health Committee’s numbers. In an email dated February 15, 2020, Gauden Galea, head of the WHO office in China, informs the joint mission members traveling to China that all of their activities in China would be arranged by the Chinese Government’s National Health Commission. “These emails set the tone early on in the coronavirus outbreak. It’s clear that the WHO allowed China to control the information flow from the start. True transparency is crucial,” said Ethan Barton, editor-in chief for the Daily Caller News Foundation. “These new emails show WHO and Fauci’s NIH special accommodations to Chinese communist efforts to control information about COVID-19,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. This is the latest information obtained in Judicial Watch and the DCNF’s ongoing investigation into Fauci’s and NIH’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Judicial Watch and the DCNF previously uncovered emails showing a WHO entity pushing for a press release, approved by Dr. Fauci, “especially” supporting China’s COVID-19 response. On September 22, U.S. District Court Judge Dabney L. Friedrich ordered HHS to begin processing responsive records. In a September 21 court filing, HHS said the agency could begin producing 300 pages of responsive records to the DCNF beginning on November 30, eight months after receiving the Daily Caller’s FOIA request. The total number of responsive records is approximately 4,200, which would have pushed off the full release of the records until at least 2022. HHS also alleged that Fauci must personally review each one of his emails before they are released."
Democrats Move To “Rig Elections Forever” Under Guise Of “Racism” Removal,3 MAR 2021,10690,"The push to ‘forever’ rig the election system in the United States is in full swing… and democrats plan to make it a law. American Greatness reported: In his first post-presidential address, Donald Trump again blasted the 2020 presidential election much to the delight of his most dedicated fans assembled at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Florida over the weekend. “We have a very sick and corrupt electoral process that must be fixed immediately,” Trump told the cheering crowd in Orlando. “This election was rigged. Our election process is worse . . . than that of a Third World country.” The former president described a long list of illegalities and abnormalities including an unprecedented volume of mishandled mail-in ballots, lack of voter identification, and “no excuse” absentee voting. Unelected partisans, Trump accurately said, rewrote rules at the last minute in violation of state election laws. He goaded both his allies and enemies with suggestions he won the election—“maybe I’ll beat them a third time,” teasing a 2024 run—and urged Republicans to fight for election integrity at the state level particularly since the Supreme Court “didn’t have the guts” to hear several election-related lawsuits. Moments before Trump took the stage, the event’s organizers released the results of a straw poll listing election integrity as the top concern of CPAC attendees. Polls continue to show the overwhelming majority of Republicans view the 2020 election as invalid despite attempts by Democrats, the media, and the U.S. Justice Department to criminalize any expressed doubts that Joe Biden won the White House fair and square. Republican state lawmakers are listening to their infuriated constituents. The GOP controls the legislatures in every state that flipped from Trump to Biden; several bills to prevent another election disaster are pending in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona. “Legislators are taking aim at mail voting at every stage, with proposals to circumscribe who can vote by mail, make it harder to obtain mail ballots, and impose hurdles to complete and cast mail ballots,” according to an analysis by the Brennan Center, a nonprofit organization opposed to Republican election remedies. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are rushing to supersede any attempt by state Republicans to eliminate COVID-justified election rules. Debate begins this week on HR 1, the “For the People Act,” which not only would codify the pandemic-era voting guidance but greatly expand access to voting in ways that would ensure a Republican never again wins the White House, not to mention many other federal and state offices. HR 1 is the biggest attempted electoral power grab in history, a flagrant and unconstitutional usurpation of the authority individual states have to write election law. The bill has the support of more than 170 union, environmental, social justice, voters’ rights, and immigration groups as well as President Biden; it’s largely premised on the need to eliminate “systemic racism” from the nation’s voting systems. “If a bill like that passed, it would immediately shatter the American people’s trust in our electoral process,” Representative James Banks (R-Ind.) told me by email. “Rewriting election rules to tip the scale in your favor is un-American and anti-democratic.” Under the “For the People Act,” every safeguard to protect a secure election process would be permanently stripped away, the American tradition of Election Day gone for good. States would be forced to begin early voting at least 15 days before Election Day and extend vote-counting until at least 10 days afterward. The American tradition of in-person voting also would be a thing of the past. Drop boxes, many situated near public transportation sites, and curbside polling sites would collect absentee ballots that are impossible to match to an eligible voter—but that won’t matter because sworn affidavits would replace the need to present proper state identification. Taxpayers would foot the bill for postage and all related costs. Registration would be a free-for-all. “Each State shall permit any eligible individual on the day of a Federal election and on any day when voting, including early voting, is permitted for a Federal election,” the bill, sponsored by Representative John Sarbanes (D-Md., reads. “A State may not refuse to accept or process an individual’s application to register to vote in elections for Federal office on the grounds that the individual is under 18 years of age at the time the individual submits the application, so long as the individual is at least 16 years of age at such time.” People claiming any type of disability, even dexterity issues, could register and vote from home, similar to the “indefinitely confined” rule imposed in Wisconsin last year. People could register online while millions who receive any sort of service at massive federal agencies including “the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the . . . Department of Defense, the . . . Department of Labor, and . . . Medicare [and] Medicaid Services of the Department of Health and Human Services” would automatically be registered to vote. Ditto for anyone accessing services at the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services but “only those who have completed the naturalization process.” What possibly could go wrong? At the same time, barriers would prevent the purging of outdated voter rolls. Vague laws to prevent “voter intimidation” or “false information” would result in prosecution just as more criminals would be added to the eligibility list. Washington, D.C. finally would win statehood and residents of U.S. territories would be eligible to vote for president. One of the greatest spoils of political victory—the power to redraw congressional and legislative districts every ten years —would be stripped from state legislatures (in most cases) and handed over to a 15-member commission with a “fair” balance of partisans to avoid gerrymandering, a practice refined over decades by Democrats in populous states but now considered verboten as those states lose seats and Republicans gain them instead. “Mapdrawers (sic) are required to avoid the unnecessary division of communities, neighborhoods, and political subdivisions,” a Brennan Center report explained. “Protections for communities of color also would be strengthened to ensure that the political power of those communities is not undermined.” Voters in each state could challenge reapportionment under the new law “instead of having to rely, as is the case presently, on claims brought under various parts of the Constitution.” The founders weep. Other provisions—new ethics and recusal rules for Supreme Court justices, free speech restrictions, public financing for campaigns—clearly favor Democratic incumbents and candidates. Censors of all types, from Big Tech to local officials, could use the sprawling law to justify silencing candidates and banning any campaign content or messaging they deem misleading. “This monster must be stopped,” Trump said, referring to HR 1. A coalition of conservatives and Trump loyalists are fighting the legislation, an uphill battle to say the least. Election fraud deniers on the Right failed to grasp that last year’s debacle was a trial run. Now that establishment figures from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to the editors of National Review continue to dismiss allegations of election fraud as Trumpian conspiracy theories, Democrats, shrewdly describing election fraud as a “Big Lie,” are emboldened to get their way. (It will be amusing to watch those on the Right who defended the integrity of the election object to HR 1.) For now, it’s a race for Republicans in swing states to shore up their election laws and prepare for a messy legal fight ahead. The Spectator added: There is a reason Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called her 791-page bill, stuffed as it is with her favorite election-related changes, House of Representatives Bill Number 1 or HR 1. It’s that important to her. She has convinced or pressured every single House Democrat to co-sponsor it as it comes up for a vote this week. That means it will likely pass narrowly given that Democrats have a 219 to 211 majority. It faces more debate and a tougher road in the Senate, which is split 50 to 50 between the parties with Vice President Kamala Harris as tiebreaker. It can be stopped. It must be stopped. It is the worst piece of legislation I have even seen in my 40 years reporting from Washington. HR 1 would cement all of the worst changes in election law made in blue states in 2020 and nationalize them. Federal control of elections would be the norm. States would be relegated to colonial outposts that carry out Washington DC’s mandates. ‘Democracies die when one party seizes control of the elections process, eliminates the safeguards that have protected the integrity of the ballot, places restrictions on free speech, and seizes the earnings of individual citizens to promote candidates they may abhor,’ says Rep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican. ‘Democracies die by suicide, and we are now face to face with such an instrument.’ Does HR 1 justify such apocalyptic rhetoric? Sadly, yes. Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission, says that while the Constitution does allow Congress to override the power of states to decide ‘the time, manner and place’ of federal elections nothing on the massive scale of HR 1 has ever been attempted. He consulted other former members and assembled a short summary of the worst provisions of HR 1: The chief author of HR 1 is Rep. John Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat. He insists with a straight face that outside of Congress ‘these aren’t controversial reforms’. Stacey Abrams, the civil rights activist who narrowly and bitterly lost her 2018 race for Georgia governor, claims that under HR 1 minority voters will ‘have a right to take our seat at the table and our place at the ballot box’. Should the power grab masquerading as HR 1 become law it will represent only the latest distortion of democracy. It will undermine confidence in the system far more than anything Donald Trump attempted. ‘When reforms don’t work as advertised, or politicians make end runs around them, Americans get cynical,’ write David Primo and Jeffrey Milyo, the co-authors of the book Campaign Finance and American Democracy: What the Public Really Thinks and Why It Matters. Should HR 1 pass, its so-called ‘reforms’ would likely send that cynicism to levels that make America increasingly resemble a banana republic."
Detention Center Employee Brings First Lawsuit Against Mandatory COVID Vaccine,3 MAR 2021,4183,"It has finally happened. At least one person is suing to stop being forced into an experimental vaccination process that is essentially ‘gene’ altering. Despite the fact that the media and the government are pushing the COVID mRNA vaccine as if it were sliced bread, hundreds of experts and scientists are skeptical. In fact, the number of deaths keeps piling up. Now, someone is fighting it, but many people have little hope in the courts actually upholding individual liberty over the hysteria of a virus that has less of a fatality rate than the flu. Las Cruces Sun News reported: A Doña Ana County Detention Center officer facing termination for declining a COVID-19 vaccination is suing county manager Fernando Macias and detention center officials over the mandate. The complaint stems from a directive Macias issued in January requiring that county-employed first responders, sheriff’s deputies, firefighters and detention center officers receive one of the two vaccines against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the disease. Detention officer Isaac Legareta claims in a federal complaint that mandating employees take vaccines that are not yet fully approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration violates the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were both approved for emergency use in December, while a third vaccine under development by Johnson & Johnson was authorized on Saturday. All three are undergoing the clinical trial process. Federal law requires disclosures to individuals about an unapproved product including risks and benefits with “the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.” The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices stated last summer in public session that vaccines under emergency use authorizations may not be mandated. In his memo, Macias wrote that unless employees were granted an accommodation, “being vaccinated is a requirement and a condition of on-going employment with the County due to the significant health and safety risks posed by contracting or spreading COVID-19.” Legareta states in the complaint that he has been written up at work and threatened with losing his job if he does not take the vaccine, in violation of the law. A personnel memo dated Feb. 17 attached to the complaint orders Legareta to submit proof that he has received a shot or registered on the state’s COVID-19 vaccine registry within five days. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against termination by the county, or reinstatement if he is fired before a ruling. He is barred from seeking monetary damages for any retaliatory discharge under state law. Legareta is seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction from further enforcement action as well as further disciplinary action or termination as a consequence for not complying. His attorney, Nancy Ana Garner of Santa Fe, had previously sent the county a cease and desist letter as well as a notice of impending litigation. Garner wrote on behalf of New Mexico Stands Up, a group that opposes COVID-19 public health emergency directives. The complaint names detention center director Bryan Baker and Capt. Ben Mendoza as well as Macias as defendants. When reached on Monday afternoon, the county confirmed it had received the complaint and request for a temporary restraining order, but the formal process had not yet been served. As of last week, most of Doña Ana County’s first responders had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine or a waiver, including 195 out of 203 detention center staff. Labor unions representing county firefighters and Doña Ana County Sheriff’s deputies have both questioned the directive and asked the county to come to the bargaining table over the issue. On Monday a spokesperson for Communication Workers of America, the deputies’ union, said all of its members had already either received the shot or obtained a waiver, rendering the issue moot."
No Big Deal: Canada Is Secretly Imprisoning All Who Enter The Country,2 MAR 2021,3778,"Has 1930s Germany been revived in Canada? It appears so. Ace of Spades Commented: Canada has “quarantine hotels” — prisons for those who tested positive for covid or who haven’t tested positive but who have just arrived in the country. That’s bad enough. But this is incredible: Even more outrageously, these are like black sites — their locations are secret and people kept there aren’t allowed to know WHERE THEY’VE BEEN IMPRISONED. So the police are taking men and women off the street and transporting them to secret locations they are not permitted to know. Does that sound too hard to believe? Well, it’s true. Canada only disclosed the location of one black-site Covid Prison due to a freedom of information act request. The location of a secret COVID-19 quarantine site operated by Justin Trudeau’s government has been released to Rebel News by the Government of Yukon through a freedom of information request. The fourth floor of the Coast High Country Inn in Whitehorse has been occupied by Trudeau’s government, while the remainder of the hotel is being used by the territorial government. A contractual agreement between the Yukon government and the Government of Canada shows that the feds demanded that the “location is being used for Federal Occupants” and that it should be treated as “confidential and that this information not be used, disclosed or otherwise communicated.” A woman was sexually assaulted at one of these secret black-site Covid Prisons. Because, of course. If you’re running black-site prisons which you are bizarrely keeping secret from the public, people are going to get the idea that it’s Thunderdome. When the government behaves as if there is no law except the Satanists’ commandment, Do What Thou Wilt, pretty soon many citizens will do likewise. Don’t worry, that can’t happen in the US. In the US, illegal aliens crossing the border get full freedom. It’s US citizens who are kept in prison. Rair Foundation added: In Quebec City, Canada, the state has the ability to force people who test positive for the coronavirus into isolation at a secret location if they are deemed “uncooperative,” according to Dr. Jacques Girard, who heads the Quebec City public health authority. During a portion of a press conference exclusively translated by RAIR Foundation USA, Girard discussed an instance where patrons from a particular bar were told to wait for test results for the coronavirus. The patrons disregarded the orders and went to other bars before the test results came back positive, which led to them being taken and forcibly placed into isolation by the state. Girard presents as a mixture of being proud of his power to force citizens who are “uncooperative” into isolation, and coy about the details of that isolation. “[W]e may isolate someone for 14 days,” Girard explained during a press conference. “And it is what we did this morning…forced a person to cooperate with the investigation…and police cooperation was exceptional.” Girard explains that if a person is told to stay in isolation, public health officials have the right to go to their home to make sure they comply. If not, the state can pick them up and force them to comply. “Because we have had people isolated at home. And then, we saw the person was not at home. So, we went to their home, and then told them, we are isolating you where we want you to be.” Watch a local news report on Bar Kirouac, which is being blamed for dozens of positive coronavirus cases: Six other Quebec City bars “known to have been frequented by Kirouac regulars” are now being examined by public health officials. It should be noted that it is not being claimed that anyone is actually sick from the coronavirus. But the state has the power to force a citizen into isolation anyway."
"National Guard Troops Hospitalized After Dem Controlled City Delivers Metal Shaving, Undercooked Food",2 MAR 2021,4534,"In Washington D.C., the National Guard troops guarding the capitol (in what no one can fully explain) have been hospitalized after undercooked food that was given to them contained poisonous metal shavings. The Gateway Pundit reported: More than a dozen Michigan National Guard troops deployed to Washington, D.C. have been sickened, with some hospitalized, after being served raw, undercooked meat and meals laced with metal shavings according to a report by WXYZ-TV reporter Brian Abel Monday evening. Other meals the troops have received courtesy of a contractor selected by the Democrat run D.C. government are leaving the troops malnourished. The problem with the undercooked food has being going for weeks but apparently yesterday’s meals were so bad they prompted a staff sergeant to contact the Detroit news station. Guard troops are being kept in D.C. because the Democrats in total control of the federal and local government fear a reprise of the storming of the Capitol that took place January 6. Last week Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said, “We know that members of the militia groups that were present on January 6 have stated their desires that they want to blow up the Capitol and kill as many members as possible with a direct nexus to the State of the Union, which we know that date has not been identified.” In his report, Abel played a recording of a whistleblower describing meals: 74 with raw beef in one delivery and lunches served on Sunday with metal shavings. Other meals are described as a dinner roll and Sunny D. Photos sent by the whistleblower were included in the report showing raw, undercooked chicken, metal shavings on rice and a meal pack with snacks suitable for a school field trip–not deployed troops. Incredibly, a solution was tried of writing the temperature the food was cooked at on the box, but all that did was show that the food was still being undercooked with germs allowed to flourish in the warm, moist meat during the time it took to be delivered to the troops. Abel reports soldiers are now being given MREs and that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is now involved. Later Monday Abel posted a comment from the Michigan National Guard. Rather than announcing the troops would be immediately recalled home by Gov. Whitmer for their safety and well being , the statement says they will remain in D.C. until the end of their tour sometime after March 12. The Michigan National Guard finds the reports of undercooked and poorly prepared food provided to our service members in Washington, D.C. very concerning. The firsthand accounts and pictures of undercooked food being served clearly shows that what is being given to Michigan’s service members is unacceptable. As soon as the first reports were received, Governor Gretchen Whitmer called Acting Secretary of the Army John E. Whitley to communicate Michigan’s concerns. Other Michigan senior leaders also engaged at the highest levels of the federal government to inform those in charge and to ensure that they knew of our displeasure with the conditions. Every assurance was given that the issue would be addressed and corrected. The Post Inaugural Security Mission is a multi-state taskforce, including Michigan’s 1000 personnel, under the command and control of the Washington D.C. National Guard. A decision was made by the leadership in Washington, D.C., to provide contracted meal service for the troops there. This contract was awarded and is monitored by the National Guard Bureau. Michigan’s Adjutant General has communicated all concerns directly to the Chief of the National Guard, General Daniel R. Hokanson, who has engaged to address the reported shortcomings of the current food service contract. The health and wellbeing of our Michigan National Guard service members is paramount to their success as they continue to serve in missions in the United States and around the globe. Senior leaders of the Michigan National Guard will remain personally engaged with this issue and will continue to push for accountability and a solution to the ill-prepared meals being served. The troops are scheduled to return back to Michigan shortly after March 12, the agreed upon end date for this deployment. Meanwhile, this is the fluff D.C. media on Capitol Hill are posting: Previously Guard troops on Capitol Hill were forced to take their breaks in frigid open air parking garages. Photos of large numbers of troops trying to rest on cold pavement sparked apparently short-lived outrage on Capitol Hill in January."
"Tucker Drops Illegal Alien Bombshell: If You Think There’s Only 11 Million, “God Help You”",2 MAR 2021,3141,"Think democrats are waiting for Americans to rise up and defeat the algorithms? Think again, folks. Democrats need an ignorant, dependent new slave base of voters, and they’ve found them in ‘migrants.’ Tucker dropped truth bombs last night about the real number of illegal aliens in the country. Citizen Free Press reported: Have you ever noticed how nobody in Washington can agree on a number? Now math is supposed to be objective except in Oregon where it is racist. But in the real world, you would think that people with functioning calculators could come to similar math-based conclusions once in a while, but not in D.C. So with all of that in mind, it’s pretty amazing to watch virtually everyone in Washington — Republican and Democrat — repeat precisely the same number on one of the most critical problems that we face, and that number is 11 million. That number they tell us is exactly how many foreign nationals currently live here illegally. All the experts say that. There are precisely 11 million undocumented aliens. Eleven million isn’t what it used to be. In any case, that’s exactly how many illegal aliens there are, 11 million, 11 million, 11 million. No more, no less. It’s almost like a script. Now people have different views on what we’ve got to do about illegal immigrants, but nobody questions how many there are because there are 11 million. Period. So it’s an earned path to citizenship, no big deal. They earned it, every bit of it. Presumably, by mocking the laws of the country they’ll now have a role in running. But actually, it is kind of a big deal. Adding 11 million new citizens would have big effects on America, profound effects. How many people is 11 million people? Well, 43 of the 50 U.S. states have a smaller population than 11 million. That’s not just Wyoming and South Dakota. It’s Virginia, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts and so on, big states. What would this cost? No one asked. It’s kind of hard to know the real answer. But if you’re trying to put the math together, be sure to factor in the free healthcare, you’ll shouldn’t be paying for every one of the 11 million. As Milton Friedman once wisely noted, you can have a welfare state or you can have open borders, but you cannot have both. Yet we’re getting both. But we may, in fact, be getting a great deal more than that, and that’s the purpose of the segment tonight. We all assume that 11 million is the real number. But is it the real number? Is that actually the number of foreign nationals who live within our borders illegally and will be getting amnesty very soon? No, it’s not the real number. In fact, it’s a totally fake number, which people endlessly repeat only because they are badly informed or dishonest. They’ve been repeating that number for a very long time, more than 15 years, at least. Way back in 2005, the Pew Research Center announced that quote, “The undocumented population has reached nearly 11 million.” The weird thing is that 12 years later, Pew had roughly the same estimate. Nothing had changed in more than a decade and that should have been a-tell that the number itself was fraudulent."
Cuomo Hires Lawyer Over Nursing Home Death Camps As Third Accuser Comes Forward,2 MAR 2021,5900,"Andrew Cuomo is up to his lecherous eyeballs in claims of harassment against women, but many people are confused about the timing of these ‘revelations.’ A few weeks ago, facts revealed that Cuomo had deliberately placed infected COVID patients in nursing homes, rather than the giant, equipped hospital ship provided by the American people and President Trump. He did this knowing that the elderly were the most vulnerable to the virus. Then purposely covered up and hid the massive number of deaths that ensued. Now, we’re all supposed to ignore that as allegations of his creep-town behavior come out? The Gateway Pundit reported: A third woman has come forward and accused New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment.
The accuser, 33-year-old Anna Ruch, said she was “uncomfortable and embarrassed” after Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her at a 2019 wedding. “He said, ‘Can I kiss you?’” Anna Ruch told The New York Times.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” she said. A photo of Cuomo putting his hands on Anna Ruch’s face at a wedding was posted to Twitter. Anna Ruch’s allegation comes after two former New York state aides accused 63-year-old Cuomo of sexual harassment. On Saturday a second former aide stepped forward and accused New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. This prompted calls from fellow Democrats for the embattled Governor to resign. In his defense, Cuomo said the comments to the young aide were “good-natured” and “misinterpreted.” Democrat state leaders are very upset over the sexual abuse allegations but not so much about the thousands of seniors that died in the state from coronavirus due to his insane nursing home policies. Via NY Times:
On Monday New York State Attorney General Letitia James announced she received the letter she needed to start an investigation of Governor Cuomo over the sexual harassment charges. Reuters added: NEW YORK (Reuters) – New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has retained a prominent white-collar criminal defense lawyer to represent his office in a federal investigation into the state’s misreporting of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents, a spokesman said on Monday. Cuomo has come under fire in recent weeks over his office’s role in reporting the official count of coronavirus fatalities among patients of nursing and extended-care facilities, as well as for allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him. Elkan Abramowitz, a former federal prosecutor now working in private practice in New York City, was hired to represent Cuomo’s “executive chamber” – consisting of the governor and his immediate staff – in the U.S. Justice Department inquiry into the COVID-19 nursing home deaths, senior advisor Rich Azzopardi told Reuters in a text message. Azzopardi earlier told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Abramowitz’s appointment, that Cuomo had not hired a lawyer in connection with the sexual harassment probe. Cuomo, one of the nation’s best-known Democratic politicians, has been accused by two former aides of engaging in a series of unwanted, sexually suggestive comments, and in one case an unsolicited kiss. On Sunday, he apologized if any of his remarks or behavior were misinterpreted as flirtatious and said he never tried to make anyone feel uncomfortable. He said he never physically touched anyone. New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday said she had accepted the governor’s formal referral of the matter to her office, clearing the way for appointment of an outside counsel to conduct an investigation into the accounts of both women – Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett. Late on Monday, a third woman, Anna Ruch, came forward in an interview published by the New York Times to accuse the governor of inappropriate conduct at a September 2019 wedding reception. As reported by the Times, Ruch recounted the governor first put his hand on her bare lower back, then when she brushed his hand away, called her “aggressive” and placed his hands on her cheeks and asked her if he could kiss her. Ruch, according to the Times, said she pulled away and the encounter left her feeling “confused and shocked and embarrassed.” The moment was caught in a cellphone photo Ruch said was taken by a friend and published by the Times with the article. Reuters was unable to independently verify Ruch’s account. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. A representative for Cuomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York governor’s brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, told viewers late on Monday he could not cover stories surrounding the allegations on the governor due their relation. “Obviously, I’m aware of what’s going on with my brother,” the CNN host said on Monday. “Obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so.” The often outspoken governor has stayed mostly out of the public eye since the sexual harassment scandal started gaining traction last week. Cuomo rose to national prominence for his daily televised briefings last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. In January, the attorney general’s office issued a report that cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying the state health department significantly undercounted the death toll in nursing homes and implemented policies that may have contributed to it. Before entering private practice, Abramowitz worked as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he served as chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s office. Abramowitz represented Cuomo’s office when federal prosecutors investigated the governor for disbanding an anti-corruption agency in 2014. He also represented filmmaker Woody Allen for many years, defending him against abuse allegations."
Parents Furious As President of Teacher’s Union Busted Dropping Of Daughter At Day-Care,1 MAR 2021,9085,"In another example of liberal hypocrisy, the Berkeley Teachers Union president was caught on film dropping off his daughter at daycare. Furious parents want to know why schools aren’t open for their kids, while the teacher’s union president gets to send his child to daycare… but apparently, they haven’t been paying attention. The rules exist for us peasants, not the ruling elite. The president’s explanation was that daycares are open… and busting him like that ‘violated’ his child’s privacy. KQED reported: Parent groups are crying “hypocrisy” after a video surfaced showing the president of the Berkeley teachers union dropping off his two-year-old daughter at an in-person preschool. Matt Meyer, president of the Berkeley Federation of Teachers, has fought for what he called the “gold standard” for the teachers he represents — saying Berkeley schools should only reopen to in-person learning when educators are vaccinated, among other criteria. A tentative plan between the Berkeley Unified School District and Berkeley Federation of Teachers in mid-February would see preschoolers through second grade returning to class at the end of March and other grades staggering back to in-person learning through April, according to Berkeleyside. But some Berkeley parents have claimed that the union is moving too slow and are pushing for earlier school reopenings. They have long argued — and the Center For Disease Control and Prevention has agreed — that schools are safe to reopen without vaccinations for all teachers. ‘Why is that safe for him and those people who work there (at the preschool), but not for all of the kids in Berkeley Unified and the teachers? The answer is: It is safe. Looking to prove a double-standard by the Berkeley Federation of Teachers union president, they followed Meyer and his 2-year-old daughter to her preschool, camera in hand. The footage they captured has ignited the ire of parents groups fighting teachers unions — and Meyer in particular. Dr. Shelene Stine treats COVID-19 patients at Highland Hospital’s department of internal medicine, but she’s also a parent of 3-year-old twins who attend the same preschool as Meyer’s daughter. Dr. Stine also has a 5-year-old attending kindergarten at a Berkeley Unified School District school. The divide between the quality in-person teaching her twins receive at the preschool — which includes “play-based learning” — compared to the senses-dulling video-screens her 5-year-old looks at for distance learning is a yawning chasm, she said. She has spoken at rallies to reopen public schools and written public letters to the Berkeley Unified School District to push them to reopen safely. Berkeley teachers have claimed that kids may not honor masking requirements, which Stine says her personal experience contradicts. “I am a physician. It is definitively the scientific agreement that it is possible to deliver safe in-person education,” Stine said. “It’s infuriating to know Matt Meyer says kids can’t wear masks when kids in his preschool wear them all day long.” Meyer, for his part, said the incident was an intrusion on his child’s privacy. While the group who filmed his family, who call themselves “Guerilla Momz” did blur out his daughter in their video, they managed to spook her, he said. “I have my two-year-old in preschool. Unfortunately, there are not public schools for kids her age. We are excited that we will be reopening soon with a plan that our members and the district supports,” Meyer said in a text message to KQED Sunday morning. He added that of the people following him and his daughter, one “scared my kid and the others in the vicinity. It was super inappropriate.” Watch the video Guerilla Momz posted to YouTube: The @guerillaMomz group declined to identify individual members by name, fearing retaliation against their kids at school. But they refuted that they scared his child, claiming they were walking quietly to avoid catching audio on the video they recorded. “We’d heard for a while that he sent his kid to private preschool and we’ve been hearing him make crazy claims at the school board meetings — it was ‘too dangerous’ for schools to open because kids wouldn’t wear masks. Meanwhile, his kid is wearing a mask at school,” the group said in a written statement. Though KQED is not identifying the preschool Meyer’s child was attending by name, the school’s website says for every one teacher there are four to five children. The video has surfaced at a unique political moment. Ferocious groups representing parents have emerged as a major political force in California and are pushing for school reopenings against teachers unions who largely want vaccines before they feel safe restarting in-person instruction. Those parent groups have protested in Berkeley, called for the ouster of school board members in Oakley, California, and rallied against San Francisco Unified School District teachers. Equity has emerged as a fault line in those discussions, with white parents overwhelmingly wishing for the return to in-person instruction in San Francisco Unified School District surveys, while Black and Brown parents show less enthusiasm about returning and Asian parents are on the opposite end of the spectrum, feeling cautious about the return to in-person instruction. So in this environment, is Meyer’s move to bring his daughter into preschool truly hypocrisy? Yalda Modabber thinks in-person preschool could pose more risks for those teachers.  She’s the founder of the El Cerrito nonprofit preschool and elementary school Golestan Education, and its accompanying educational consultancy firm. Before her career as an educator, Modabber spent 15 years as an immunologist. She is also the parent of two students, aged 14 and 17, in the Berkeley Unified School District. And she is on an advisory panel for Berkeley school reopening. Modabber didn’t want to speak specifically about the preschool Meyer’s child is attending as she hasn’t looked into it. But in general, she is concerned about the safety of preschool teachers, even more so than that of elementary school teachers. “The older the children are, the more able they are to control their bodies and they need less physical comforting. So in a preschool setting, you have children that will throughout the day need to be comforted and held,” Moldabber said. “And so there’s no way to maintain that proximity (like social distancing).” She did caution that smaller children aren’t as likely to spread COVID-19 due to lower lung capacity and fewer of the cell receptors that make viral transmission more viable. “So in seeing this video, I’m sort of torn,” she said. On the other hand, with Berkeley’s school district “we’re talking about 10,000 students and the class sizes are large. So you have one teacher for 20 to 30 kids. It’s very different from a preschool or daycare where they may have one teacher for six kids,” she said. On the comparison of public schools with more children to private ones with fewer class sizes, Meyer agrees. Meyer said that his job is to advocate for the will of the teachers in his union, and where he sends his own children is a “personal choice.” Preschools, he said, are “a completely different universe from an elementary school in terms of size, services provided, outside space, and public health guidelines. I don’t have elementary school-aged children,” he said, “So I haven’t had to make those choices.” But to many parents, those distinctions are a moot point. “It’s completely opposite of what he’s pushing,” said Jonathan Zachreson, the founder of Reopen California Schools, which counts Berkeley parents among many of its members. “So why is that safe for him and those people who work there (at the preschool), but not for all of the kids in Berkeley Unified and the teachers? The answer is: It is safe.” ‘It’s infuriating to know Matt Meyer says kids can’t wear masks when kids in his preschool wear them all day long. Berkeley parent Mara Kolesas, a former PTA Berkeley Council president, said while she understands the anger felt by parents — and agrees schools should be opened — following Meyer’s two-year-old with a camera crosses a line. “I do not agree with it at all,” Kolesas said. Conflating private preschools and public schools is one mistake, she said. Another is mixing the political with the personal, which to her dilutes the clearer message that most science agrees schools can reopen safely. “For me, you don’t need to attack people personally, you need to address it politically. When you start getting personal, you mix up dimensions, and you don’t get to discuss the real thing,” Kolesas said. “Here, the real thing is (Meyer) put fear before science, and the right of teachers before the right of kids. That’s the issue.” Zachreson, the founder of Reopen California Schools, said parents will view Meyer’s actions through the lens of their own experiences. With smaller children “they’re probably interacting even more than you would at school,” Zachreson said. “So it’s the hypocrisy that’s really frustrating.”"
Trump At CPAC: Do You Miss Me Yet? Audience Chants “You Won!” As 2024 Looms,1 MAR 2021,70659,"President Trump brought the house down last night during his speech at CPAC. His words were powerful and honest, something that Americans have never seen from a politician. He hinted at a “third win” and called out the dismal failure of the ‘installed’ Biden. Pay close attention to his hints about 2024, and the facts that he has begun a new PAC. Conservative Treehouse posted the transcript: Well thank you very much CPAC. Do you miss me yet? Do you miss me? A lot of things going on to so many wonderful friends, Conservatives and fellow citizens in this room all across our country. I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we begun together we went through a journey like nobody else. There’s never been a journey like it, there’s never been a journey so successful. We began it together four years ago and it is far from being over. And you know what this is? The hardest working people, hard working American patriots, it’s just getting started and in the end we will win. We will win. We’ve been doing a lot of winning. As we gather this week, we’re in the middle of a historic struggle for America’s future, America’s culture and America’s institutions, borders, and most cherished principles. Our security, our prosperity, and our very identity as Americans is at stake, like perhaps at no other time. So no matter how much the Washington establishment and the powerful, special interests may want to silence us, let there be no doubt we will be victorious and America will be stronger and greater than ever before. I want to thank my great friends, Matt and Mercedes Schlap, Matt, thank you. Mercedes, thank you very much. And the American Conservative Union for hosting this extraordinary event. They’re talking about it all over the world man, I know you don’t like it [inaudible 00:05:19] okay. All over the world. I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh who is watching closely and smiling down on us. He’s watching and he’s loving it and he loves Catherine. Catherine, thank you for being here. So great. Thank you Catherine. He loved you Catherine, I will tell you that. Fantastic. Thank you Catherine very much. To each and every one of you here at CPAC I am more grateful to you than you will ever know. We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future of our movement, the future of our party and the future of our beloved country. For the next four years, the brave Republicans in this room will be at the heart of the effort to oppose the radical Democrats, the fake news media and their toxic cancel culture, something new to our ears, cancel culture. And I want you to know that I’m going to continue to fight right by your side. We will do what we’ve done right from the beginning, which is to win. We’re not starting new parties. They kept saying, “He’s going to start a brand new party.” We have the Republican party it’s going to unite and be stronger than ever before. I am not starting a new party. That was fake news, fake news. No. Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Let’s start a new party and let’s divide our vote so that you can never win. No, we’re not interested in that. Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody’s ever heard of before, more popular than anybody. That’s all of us, it’s all of us. Those are great numbers and I want to thank you very much. Those are incredible numbers. I came here and he was giving me 95%, 97%, 92%. And I said, “They’re great.” And I want to thank everybody in this room and everybody all throughout the country, throughout the world if you want to really know the truth. Thank you President Trump! Thank you, darling. Thank you. We will be united and strong like never before, we will save and strengthen America. We will fight the onslaught of radicalism, socialism, and indeed it all leads to communism once and for all. That’s what it leads to. You’ll be hearing more and more about that as we go along, but that’s what it leads to. You know that. We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad, but none of us even imagined just how bad they would be and how far left they would go. He never talked about this. We would have those wonderful debates, he would never talk about this. We didn’t know what the hell he was talking about actually. His campaign was all lies. Talked about energy, I said, “This guy actually he’s okay with energy.” He wasn’t okay with energy, he wants to put you all out of the business. He’s not okay with energy. He wants windmills, the windmills. The windmills that don’t work when you need them. Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any President in modern history, that’s true. Already the Biden administration has proved that they are anti-jobs, anti-family anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women, and anti-science. In just one short month we have gone from America first to America last. Think about it, right? America last. There is no better example than the new and horrible crisis on our Southern border. We did such a good job. It was all worked, nobody’s ever seen anything like we did and now he wants it all to go to hell. When I left office just six weeks ago, we had created the most secure border in U.S. history. We had built almost 500 miles of great border wall that helped us with these numbers because once it’s up, they used to say, “The wall doesn’t work.” Well you know what I’ve always said? Walls and wheels, those are two things that will never change. The wall has been amazing. It’s been incredible and little sections of it to complete, they don’t want to complete it. They don’t want to complete little sections in certain little areas, they don’t want to complete. But it’s had an impact that nobody would have even believed. It’s amazing considering that the Democrats’ number one priority was to make sure that the wall would never, ever get built, would never, ever happen, would never get financed. We got it, financed. We ended catch and release, ended asylum fraud and brought illegal crossings to historic lows. When illegal aliens trespass across our borders, they were prominently caught, detained and sent back home and these were some rough customers, I want to tell you. Some rough customers entering our country. It took them the new administration only a few weeks to turn this unprecedented accomplishment into a self inflicted humanitarian and national security disaster. By recklessly eliminating our border security measures, controls, all of the things that we put into place, Joe Biden has triggered a massive flood of illegal immigration into our country the likes of which we have never seen before. They’re coming up by the tens of thousands. They’re all coming to take advantage of the things that he said that’s luring everybody to come to America. And we’re one country, we can’t afford the problems of the world as much as we’d love to. We’d love to help but we can’t do that. So they’re all coming because of promises and foolish words. Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden’s decision to cancel border security has single handedly launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and some of the most evil people on the planet. You see it every day, just turn on the news, you’ll see it every day. Under my administration, we stopped the child smugglers, we dismantled the criminal cartels. We greatly limited drug and human trafficking to a level that nobody actually thought was possible and the wall helped us a lot and we protected vulnerable people from the ravages of dangerous predators and that’s what they are. Dangerous, dangerous predators. But the Biden administration is put the vile coyotes back in business and has done so in a very, very big way under the new administration, catch and release has been restored. Can you imagine? We worked so hard. Catch, you know where that is? You catch them, you take their name, they may be killers, they may be rapists, they may be drug smugglers, you take their name and you release them into our country. We did the opposite. We not only didn’t release them, we had them brought back to their country. Illegal immigrants are now being apprehended and released along the entire Southern border, just the opposite of what it was two months ago. They weren’t coming because they couldn’t get in. Once they think they can get in, they’re coming and they are coming at levels that you haven’t even seen yet. By the hundreds of thousands, by the millions they’ll be coming. The Biden administration is now actively expediting the admission of illegal migrants, enabling them to lodge, frivolous asylum claims and admitting them by the thousands and thousands and thousands a day, crowded together in unsanitary conditions despite the ongoing economic and public health crisis, COVID-19, or as I call it the China virus. There’s no masks, there’s no double masks, that was a new one that came out two weeks ago. First Fauci said, you don’t need masks, no masks, no good, now he wants double masks. No social distancing, no nothing, no nothing. That together and I say it actually and I say for them, and I say it for our country, what the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral and indefensible, hard to believe it’s happening. Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive, enforcing America’s laws. This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms and to lose the white house decisively four years from now. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Actually, as you know, they just lost the white house, but it’s one of those. But who knows? Who knows, I may even decide to beat them for a third time, okay? Joe Biden defunded the border wall and stopped all future construction even on small open sections that just needed to be finished up, routine little work it’s already been bought. Wait until the contractors get to them and they say, “No, it costs this much more money not to finish the small sections then if we finished it,” that’s going to be nice. Wait until you see those bills start pouring in. He revoked the executive order cracking down on deadly sanctuary cities. He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more. Let’s not deport people. And restricting our law enforcement professionals and they are great professionals, you have many of them represented here today, from conducting almost any immigration enforcement of any kind. The Biden policy of releasing criminals into the U.S. interior is making America into a sanctuary nation where criminals, illegal immigrants, including gang members and sex offenders are set free into American communities. They have no idea and remember with the caravans, these countries, not only the three of them, but many, many countries all over the world, they’re not giving us the best and their finest because they’re intelligent. They’re not giving us their best and their finest, remember I said that? I said that a long time ago when I made the first remarks, when I came down the escalator with our great future first lady, who says hello. Who loves you as much as I love you. I said that a long time ago, and we turned out to be 100% correct. Biden’s radical immigration policies aren’t just illegal, they’re immoral, they’re heartless and they are a betrayal of our nation’s core values. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening The Republican party must hold Joe Biden and the Democrats accountable. They ripped up the diplomatic agreements we negotiated with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to shut down illegal immigration. They got a fortune, they got paid $500 million a year. When I came into office, those countries were refusing to take back illegal alien gang members, including MS13, the most vicious probably of them all. No matter where you go in the world, MS13, they do things that even the worst don’t think about. So I asked, “How much do we pay these countries? How much do we pay them?” Sir, we pay them approximately $500 million a year. That’s a lot of money. I mean, it’s peanuts compared to the way other countries rip us off but that’s a lot of money. I said, “Okay, we aren’t going to pay them anymore because they wouldn’t take back the criminals.” And this was true with the Obama administration, it was true for many, many years. So we’d catch a murderer we’d want to bring them back to Guatemala or Honduras or El Salvador, they wouldn’t take them back. No, we don’t want them. We’d fly them in, they wouldn’t let the plane land, we’d bus them and they wouldn’t let the buses get anywhere near the border. And I said, “We’re not going to pay them anymore.” So after I said that, and I stopped payment, like a term that we use in the world of business, let’s stop payment. So we stopped payment, they were delinquent. We stopped payment and they very quickly came to the table and we made a deal very quickly. We still kept the money. We still didn’t pay it but we made a deal. And when illegal aliens came across our border they were rapidly deported and lovingly accepted by those countries from where they came and it worked, so they accept the people and we ultimately got along very well with those countries, those three countries, and many countries throughout the world, because they respected us again. They didn’t respect us. They couldn’t believe what they were getting away with. But now Joe Biden has wrecked this great deal, wrecked it. And they’re already doing what they were doing before, and they’re taking the money and that’s just a small portion of what’s going on. To top it all off, the Biden people are pushing a bill that would grant mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens while massively expanding chain migration. That’s where you come in and everybody comes in, your grandmother, your father, your mother, your brother, your cousins, they come in so easily. So crazy, so crazy. It even requires that the U.S. government provide a illegal border crossings with taxable funded lawyers, lawyers. Anybody need a good lawyer? You can’t have one. They get the lawyers, they lawyers. They’re probably very good to. The Democrat immigration bill is a globalist corp. You take a look at the corporatists, big tech attack on hard working citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed and Republicans must ensure that it never is allowed to become federal law, which is what they want to do. We must stand tall in the party. We have to do this. We have to stand tall as the [inaudible 00:22:10] for law abiding Americans and others when they’re in our country. Border security is just one of the many issues on which the new administration has already betrayed the American people. He didn’t talk about this stuff. I debated him. He wasn’t talking about this. What he signed with those executive orders. They weren’t things that were discussed. We didn’t know all about him and the press because they’re fake news. They’re the biggest fakers there are. But the press refused to ask the questions and when I asked the questions on television, on the debate, Chris Wallace, in this case, and others refused to let him answer. They refused to let him answer the questions. Maybe we could have found something, or if the media did its job, which they don’t. Their callous indifference to working families is equally clear when it comes to the critical matter of getting Americans’ children back to school. And they must get back and get back right now, right now. Crazy. Terrible. Terrible. The Biden administration is actually bragging about the classroom education they are providing to migrant children on the border while at the same time, millions of American children are having their futures destroyed by Joe Biden’s anti-science school closures. Think of it. We’re educating students on the [inaudible 00:23:55] but our own people, children of our citizens, citizens themselves are not getting the education themselves; are not getting the education that they deserve. There’s no reason whatsoever why the vast majority of young Americans should not be back in school immediately. The only reason that most parents do not have that choice is because Joe Biden sold out America’s children to the teacher’s unions. His position is morally inexcusable. You know that. Joe Biden has shamefully betrayed America’s youth and he is cruelly keeping our children locked in their homes, no reason for it whatsoever, they want to get out. They’re cheating the next generation of Americans out of the future that they deserve. And they do deserve this future. They’re going to grow up and they’re going to have a scar. It’s a scandal of the highest order and one of the most graven acts by any president in our lifetimes. It’s the teacher’s union, it’s the votes and it shouldn’t happen. And I have, nobody has more respect for teachers than I do. And I’ll bet you a lot of the people within that union, they agree with everything I’m saying. Even the New York Times is calling out the Democrats. The mental and physical health of these young people is reaching a breaking point. Tragically suicide attempts have skyrocketed and student depression is now commonplace and at levels that we’ve never seen before. The Democrats now say we have to pass their $1.9 trillion boondoggle to open schools, but a very small part of it has to do with that. You know where it’s going. It’s going to bail out badly run Democrat cities. So much of it. But billions of dollars for schools remain unspent from the COVID relief bills that were passed last year. So on behalf of the moms, dads and children of America, I call on Joe Biden to get the schools open and get them open now. It’d be a great thing to do. When I left office, and we’re very proud of this because this was something that they said could not be done. The FDA said it, everybody said it, any article that you read said it. Couldn’t be done. It would be years and years. I handed the new administration what everyone is now calling a modern day medical miracle. Some say it’s the greatest thing to happen in hundreds of years, hundreds of years. Two vaccines produced in record [inaudible 00:26:51] others on the way, including the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that was approved just yesterday. And therapeutic relief, also, if you’re sick. If you’re sick, we have things now that are incredible. What has taken place over the last year under our administration would have taken any other president at least five years. And we got it done in nine months. Everyone says five years, five years. Can you imagine if you had to go through what all of the countries of the world who are now getting the vaccine or soon will be getting it from various companies. But can you imagine if all of those countries had to go through what they’ve been going through over the last year? You’d lose hundreds of millions of people. I pushed the FDA like they have never been pushed before. They told me that loud and clear. They have never been pushed like I pushed them. I didn’t like them at all. But once we got it done, I said I now love you very much. What the Trump administration has done with vaccines has in many respects, perhaps saved large portions of the world. Not only our country, but large portions of the world. Not only did we push the FDA far beyond what the bureaucrats wanted to do, we also put up billions and billions of dollars, 10 billion, to produce the vaccines before we knew they were going to work. It was called a calculated bet or a calculated risk. We took a risk because if we didn’t do that, you still wouldn’t have the vaccines. You wouldn’t have them for a long time. So think of that. We took this bet, we made a bet because we feel we’re on a certain track. But you’d be starting to make them right now. It’d be a long time before you ever saw. It takes 60 to a hundred days to manufacture and inspect new doses. And that means that 100% of the increased availability that we have now was initiated by our administration. 100%. In fact, the director of national institutes of health, Francis Collins, he’s Fauci’s boss, actually. I think he’s a Democrat too, by the way. Recently said that our operation warp speed was absolutely breathtaking. And that the Trump administration deserves full credit. Which we do. And as conservatives and Republicans, never forget that we did it. Never let them take the credit because they don’t deserve the credit. They just followed now, they’re following our plan, but this has been something that they really call it an absolute miracle. Joe Biden is only implementing the plan that we put in place. And if we had an honest media, which we don’t. They would say it loud and clear. By the time I left that magnificent house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, almost 20 million Americans had already been vaccinated. 1.5 million doses were administered on my final day alone. 1.5 million in a day. Yet Biden said just a few days ago that when he got here, meaning the white house, there was no vaccine. He said there’s no vaccine. Oh good. Say it again, Joe. Now I don’t think he said that, frankly, in a malicious way. I really don’t. I actually believe he said that because he didn’t really know what the hell was happening. But never let them forget, this was us. We did this. And the distribution is moving along according to our plan. And it’s moving along really well. We had the military, what they’ve done, our generals and all of the people what [inaudible 00:31:30] incredible. But remember, we took care of a lot of people. Including, I guess on December 21st, we took care of Joe Biden, because he got his shot. He got his vaccine. He forgot. It shows you how unpainful that vaccine shot is. So everybody go get your shot. He forgot. So it wasn’t very traumatic, obviously. But he got his shot. And it’s good that he got his shot. Last year, I predicted to you that the extremist corruption and incompetence of the Biden administration would be literally unprecedented in American history. Unfortunately, he has proven me 100% right. Already, as president, Biden has urged [inaudible 00:32:19] legislation shredding your second amendment. Your second amendment is in far bigger trouble than you know. And for four years, I fought like hell to save your second amendment. And we saved it 100&. We saved it. We signed an order to conduct politically correct, far-left indoctrination trainings in every department of the federal government, including the U S military, after I had terminated these horrible things that were being preached to our military. And he wants it to go forward. It’s insane. Within his first few hours Biden eliminated our national security travel bans on nations plagued by terrorism. His first priority was to open up borders to unvetted travelers from Libya, Yemen, Syria, Somalia [inaudible 00:33:14] other countries where strict vetting cannot occur. Countries that have tremendous problems. Countries with tremendous terrorism problems. We did a travel ban. It was a real achievement. We told those countries, sorry, straighten out your act. We don’t want people coming in where they had an ideology or a problem. We just couldn’t have it. And it was incredible. How it worked was incredible. And he terminated it. We had to get it approved. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. We got it approved and he terminates it. In addition, he’s already increased refugee admissions by nearly 10 times. But in effect, it will soon be hundreds of times as millions of people flow up through our soon to be open borders. And by the way, the border patrol and ICE are some of the great heroes of our country. These are incredible people. I got to know them very well. Your family still cannot go out to eat at local restaurants, but Joe Biden is bringing in thousands upon thousands of refugees from all over the world, people that nobody knows anything about. We don’t have crime records. We don’t have health records. What are they bringing in with them? When I left office, we had virtually ended the endless wars. These endless wars, they go on forever. They go on forever. I would go to Dover and I would see caskets, coffins coming in. I’d see the parents and wives and husbands. I would see the kids. Endless wars. 19 years in Afghanistan, we have it down to almost [inaudible 00:35:00] left and I hear they might want to go back in. Iraq. Remember I used to say don’t go in, but if you’re going to go in, keep the oil [inaudible 00:35:09] but we didn’t keep the oil. We had made historic peace deals in the Middle East like nobody thought were even possible. There’s not a drop of blood shed. And by the way, not one American soldier has been killed in Afghanistan in over a year. Think of that. Not one. Those troops have largely come home. At the same time, the new administration unilaterally withdrew our crippling sanctions on Iran, foolishly giving away all of America’s leverage before negotiations have even begun. Leave the sanctions, negotiate. Does anybody understand what I’m saying here? Are there any good business people? You don’t have to be a good. Are there any bad business people? They took off of the sanctions. They took off the sanctions. They said, well, we’re going to not have any sanctions. Let’s negotiate a deal. I don’t know, Matt Schlapp, I don’t think you would have done that. Do you think so, Matt? I don’t think so. Mercedes wouldn’t have. No, you do that, you make a deal, and then you do what they wanted. I will tell you something. And I said it. Had we had a fair election, the results would have been much different, and we would have had a deal. We would have had a deal with Iran within [inaudible 00:36:51]. They wanted those sanctions off of… Took them off for nothing. For nothing. Now you watch how tough they negotiate. In another horrendous surrender, he agreed to get back into the World Health Organization. For approximately $500 million a year, which is what we were paying. When I withdrew from the WHO, and you know the whole story with that, they called it badly. They really are puppets for China. They called and they wanted us to stay in. I said how much are we paying? Approximately $500 million. How much is China paying? A much larger in terms of population country. Sir, they’re paying $39 million. I said why are we paying 500 million and they’re paying 39. I can tell you why. Because the people that made the deal are stupid. That’s why. And I had no idea how popular was… I didn’t even know if I would be able to politically because people were so happy when I did get out. But I said, so if we went in, we could get it for 39 million, which is what China, not 500 million, which is what we were stupidly paying. And they said, we can make a deal. We want you to go in. We can make a deal. Okay. And I decided not to do it. But we could have had it for 39. We could have had it for the same as China. And they decide, now to go back into the World Health Organization and pay 500 million. What the hell is wrong with that? No, no. This is just emblematic. It’s a tremendous amount of money. But compared to trillions, it’s not. But it’s a tremendous amount of money. Why would China pay 39 million and we’re paying almost 500 million? Why? So we could have made the same deal that China had. 39 million. And they just say, we’re going back in. We’re going back into the World Health Organization. They go back in, they pay 500. It is so sad. Just like the Iran and the World Health Organization, Joe Biden put the United States back into the very unfair and very costly Paris climate accord without negotiating a better deal. They wanted us so badly back in. I’ll tell you they wanted us. I was getting called from all of the countries. You must come back into the Paris accord. I said, tell me why. Give me one good reason. First of all, China doesn’t kick in for 10 years. Russia goes by an old standard, which was not a clean standard. And other countries, but we get hit right from the beginning. Would have cost us hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs. It was a disaster. But they go back in. I could have made an unbelievable deal and got back in, but I didn’t want to do that. Surrendering millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to all of these other countries. Almost all of them that were in the deal. So they have favorable treatment. We don’t have favorable treatment. And we just said, we’re going back in. To go back in, they wanted us so badly, you could’ve negotiated. If you wanted to go back in [inaudible 00:39:58] the cleanest air, the cleanest water and everything else that we’ve ever had. So I don’t know why we have to. And what good does it do when we’re clean, but China’s not, and Russia’s not, and India’s not. So they’re pouring fumes. You know, the world is actually a small [inaudible 00:40:18], right? They’re pouring fumes and we’re trying to protect everything and building products for three times more than [inaudible 00:40:26] say no. They could have made a great deal. If they were going to go back in, that’s fine. But they could have made a great deal instead of just saying we’re back in. These [inaudible 00:40:35]. And in one of his first official acts, which was incredible, because again, he talked about energy. He never said he was going to do this. He canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline. Destroying [inaudible 00:40:47] or the 9,000 or the 11,000 jobs that you hear. But 42,000 great paying jobs. On just about day one, right? He never talked about that during a debate because he wouldn’t have gotten away with it. Well, he would have because they cheated so much it probably wouldn’t have mattered. No, but that was not a topic of conversation. Remember? Fracking. You could track. Oh, we love fracking. During the primary, no fracking. As soon as he got through that, he said, no, of course everybody can frack. No fracking. You wait till you see what happens with your gasoline. Wait till you see what happens and we cannot let this stuff continue to go on. One of my proudest accomplishments as president was to make America energy independent. The United States became the number one energy superpower. Number one. Became number one, bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia by a lot. We left them all in the dust. They were all on [inaudible 00:42:02]. But if the Democrats have their way, we are heading from energy dominance to energy disaster. That’s what’s happening. You have to see what’s going on. Everything’s being closed up. It’s a disaster. The blackouts we saw in California last summer and all the time. The windmill calamity that we’re witnessing in Texas. Great state of Texas. We love Texas. But it’s so sad when you look at it. That’ll just be the start. How bad is wind power? So I talk about it all the time at CPAC, right? We went to CPAC. Remember last year, I said, we’re going to watch the president. Alice, the wind isn’t blowing. I don’t believe we’ll have any electricity. Remember we would kid, but I wasn’t actually kidding. It’s such an expensive form of energy. It’s so bad for the environment. It kills the birds. It destroys the landscapes. And remember, these are structural columns with fans on them. They wear out. And when they wear out all over the country, you see them, nobody takes them down. They’re rotting. They’re rusting. How this is environmentally good for our country. And it costs many, many times more than natural gas, which is clean. It costs many more… And can fuel our great [inaudible 00:43:20]. We can’t do that. And solar, I love solar but it doesn’t have the capacity to do what we have to do to make America great again. Sorry it just doesn’t have it. Under the radical Democrat policies, the price of gasoline has already surged 30% since the election. And we’ll go to $5, $6, $7 and even higher. So enjoy that when you go to the pump. They’ll say, that’ll be about $200 to fill up your van. You’ll go to the… Remember they used to go to the little small vans. They got away from the big ones that everybody wanted. They went to the small ones. Well, you know what? Probably a good investment. As long as these guys have their say, because you know, it’s a shame what’s happening. Energy prices are going to go through the roof. And that includes your electric bills. That includes any bill having to do with energy. Our biggest cost. We will now be relying on Russia and the Middle East for oil. And they talked about Russia, Russia, Russia. What’s better than what this guy has done for Russia? I had oil where they were actually paying you to take it. Okay. You know, I was… Remember they were going to give you 37 a barrel, but you got to take it away. You had free oil almost for a period of time and one way I was proud of it, but we also had to save the energy industry and it worked out well. And I dealt with Russia [inaudible 00:44:39] and they cut back on production. And we got it back up. But now it’s going the opposite because now they’re taking this incredible energy independence away from the people of our country. And you’re going to see costs go like you have never seen them go before. It’s a very sad and very stupid thing that they’re doing. The Biden policies are a massive win for other oil producing countries. And a loss for the United States and our great citizens. Joe Biden and the Democrats are even pushing policies that would destroy women’s sports. A lot of new records are being broken in women’s sports. Hate to say that ladies, but got a lot of new records, they’re being shattered. [inaudible 00:45:28] the weightlifting. Every ounce was like a big deal for many years. All of a sudden somebody comes along and beats it by a hundred [inaudible 00:45:36]. Young girls and women are in sex that they are now being forced to compete against those who are biological males. It’s not good for women. It’s not good for women’s sports, which worked so long and so hard to get to where they are. The records that stood for years, even decades, are now being smashed with [inaudible 00:46:00]. Smashed. If this does not change, women’s sports, as we know it, will die. They’ll end. It’ll end. What coach, if I’m a coach, I want to be a great coach. What coach, as an example, wants to recruit a young woman to compete if her record can easily be broken by somebody who was born a man. Not too many of those coaches around, right? They are around, they won’t be around long because they’re going to have a big problem when their record is… We’re 0 and 16, but we’re getting better. No, I think it’s crazy. I think it’s just crazy what’s happening. We must protect the integrity of women’s sports. So important. Have to. And I don’t even know, is that controversial? Somebody said well, that’s going to be very controversial. I said, that’s okay. You haven’t heard anything yet. As you can see, the early weeks of the Biden administration of nothing less than they’ve been a catastrophe for American workers and for American families. [inaudible 00:47:23] of our mission. And for us, it’s our movement. As I said, a movement, like has never been seen. I think we can probably say, never been seen anywhere in the world. And nobody’s ever seen a movement like this. I’d grow out and I’d watch somebody who came in second in New Hampshire or first in Iowa and that was the end and they became famous for the rest of their lives. We won the election twice. I mean you know think about it. The task for our movement and our party is to stand up to this destructive agenda with confidence and with resolve. … this destructive agenda with confidence and with resolve. The future of the Republican Party is as a party that defends the social, economic, and cultural interests and values of working American families of every race, color, and creed. That’s why the party is growing so rapidly and is becoming a different party. And it’s becoming a party of love. You have to see outside the streets. I mean, there’s such love. The flags … Amazing. Audience: USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. That’s right. Now it’s a party that’s incredible. The people, the spirit, and there are, as you probably heard a little while ago, I mean, there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been, including even before the election. More spirit now than we’ve ever seen, because people are seeing how bad it can be. And again, I want to thank Rush and Kathryn because what he did to get the word out has been incredible. Some people are irreplaceable as Sean Hannity would say, and he said, “Rush is replaceable,” but his spirit lives on and that’s something that we need and we love. Republicans believe that the deeds of every citizen must come first. In fact, America must come first. We don’t put it first. They don’t put it first. Over the past four years my administration delivered for Americans of all backgrounds like never before, like never before. We built the strongest economy in the history of the world, raised wages, and achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever, ever, ever recorded. It was so great for everybody of all backgrounds that even after the China virus, we are leading the world, nobody’s even close. We’re leading it in the comeback. Our economic comeback has been incredible. That’s because the financial and economic foundation we built was so strong that unlike other countries, who are having a hard time, we didn’t break. We came roaring back and now our stock market and your 401ks are again at record levels, higher than ever before actually. Many people have asked what is Trumpism, a new term being used more and more. I’m hearing that term more and more. I didn’t come up with it, but what it means is great deals, great trade deals, great ones, not deals where we give away everything, our jobs, money. Like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever made. And we ended it. You know, a lot of people forget, we ended it. Now we have the USMCA, Mexico, Canada. It’s incredible what it’s done for our farmers who are doing fantastically. Did you see grain prices and grain sales are at an all time high? Wheat, all time high. So many elements of farms and farmers, and they love me. And remember, it’s going to be very close in Iowa. Well, it wasn’t close. We won a landslide, Iowa, because our farmers know, and they put up with it and we did a lot of work with the tariffs and all these things that we had to do to get it, and now the farmers are doing great. But they’re setting records. It means low taxes and eliminated job killing regulations, Trumpism. It means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit. So they come in and they can help us as opposed to coming here and not being good for us, including criminals, of which there are many, it means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement. It means very strong protection for the second amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. It means support for the forgotten men and women who have been taken advantage of for so many years. And they were doing great, they were doing great before that horrible thing from China came in and hit us. And now they’re starting to do really well again. If you think about it, we built the economy twice. We built a then and then like every other country in the world, it went down and then we built it again. Now it’s higher in many ways, certainly in the stock pocket, it’s higher in many ways than it was before. That’s because of the foundation and no country comes even close to competing with our comeback. And it means a strong military and taking care of our vets, but a strong military, which we have totally rebuilt, we have rebuilt it. And our military has never been stronger than it is today. It was tired, it was depleted, it was obsolete. And now we have the best brand new equipment ever made and it was all produced right here in the USA. Isn’t that nice? And we take care of our vets. We had a call recently just before leaving office, the vets had a 91% approval rating for the way we took care of them. It’s the highest number in the history of the polls. The vet polls. On top of all of that, we have even created the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States in nearly 75 years. The mission of the Democrat Party is to promote socialism. They want to promote socialism, ultimately leading unfortunately to communism. And that will happen. If you look at Venezuela, you look at some of these countries, that’s why some of our biggest supporters are from South America, Latin America, because they’ve seen what goes on with all of this cancel culture and you can’t speak it, and let’s cut them off, and let’s not give them words. The mission of our movement and of the Republican Party must be to create a future of good jobs, strong family, safe communities, a vibrant culture, and a great nation for all Americans. And that’s what we’re creating. Their party is based upon unvarnished disdain for America, its past, and its people. You see that happening. It’s horrible the way they treat the legacy of our country, the culture of our country. Our party is based on love for America and the belief that this is an exceptional nation blessed by God. We take great pride in our country. We teach the truth about history. We celebrate our rich heritage and national traditions. We honor George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and all national heroes. And of course, we respect our great American flag. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Audience: We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Thank you. Audience: We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Thank you very much. So nice. I started that hearing, we really where … we’re getting word of that, hearing that during some of the rallies, especially the latter rallies where we set records. We had 56 unbelievable packed rallies. And nobody’s ever had anything that we had. And we started hearing, “We love you.” And I asked somebody because we really like Ronald Reagan, right? He was a great president. We had others. But I said, “Did anybody ever say that to Ronald Reagan or to any of our great … .” And to the best of all of these political professionals’ knowledge and pollsters. Nobody’s ever heard that yet before, man. So it’s an honor. Believe me, it’s an honor. Great honor. That’s a great honor. When you think about, we love you. When you’re saying that about … I hate to say it, am I a politician? I don’t know. Maybe I’m a politician. I hate to admit it, but it’s an honor that you would say. We believe in patriotic education and strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of Americans youth. It’s horrible. We are committed to defending innocent life and to upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our founders and our founding. We have raised free thought, we stand up to political correctors, and we reject left wing lunacy. And in particular we reject cancel culture. We know that the rule of law is the ultimate safeguard. And we affirm that the constitution means exactly what it says, as written, as written. They want to change it. They want to change it. They want to get rid of it, frankly. We believe in law and order and we believe that the men and women of law enforcement are heroes who truly deserve our absolute support. We don’t defund the police. We are not defunding the police. We believe in standing up to China, shutting down outsourcing, bringing back our factories and supply chains, and ensuring that America not China dominates the future of the world. So it’s going to happen. And by the way, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China during my administration, hundreds of … and they never gave us 25 cents. It was a one-way street. We took in hundreds of billions and during negotiations, they would say, “Look, the one thing, we don’t want any more of these tariffs. These tariffs … .” Those tariffs, we took in so much money. And what happened is they became competitive. So what happened with the people, they wouldn’t go to China. They built a lot of it back in our country. They would make it here instead. And in addition to that, we were taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars from China. But in all fairness to China, we made a trade deal with them, this was prior to COVID. And once COVID happened, I no longer cared so much about the great deal, because what happened with that was just disgraceful. But that’s one of the things, that’s one of the reasons that right now our farmers are doing so good. I used to tell China, “Look, look, go and get lot of wheat. Get a lot of different things. All of the things we just talked about, you better go out and do it because this country has not been treated fairly by you for many, many years. Many, many years.” We used to lose $504 billion trade deficit with China. 500, not million, $504 million is a lot, right? You know that through the World Health Organization. Now take 504 million, make it $504 billion. We had deficits with China. It was absolutely insane that this could keep going on. It’s amazing that you still have a country left. The people that did this to our country, they should be ashamed of themselves. They should be ashamed of themselves. Companies that leave America to create jobs in China and other countries that have ripped us off for years, should not be rewarded. They should be tarriffed, fined, and punished. They should not be rewarded. And that’s what the Biden administration is doing. But of course, as you know, they have a very close, personal relationship with China. So I don’t expect much to happen. It’s a shame because it really is a threat. It’s a tremendous economic threat. And thank God we’ve rebuilt our military, but it’s a tremendous economic threat. Never forget it. These are the convictions that define our movement today and must define the Republican Party in the years ahead. Very simple, it’s really quite simple, isn’t it? Another one of the most urgent issues facing the Republican Party is that of ensuring fair, honest, and secure elections. Such a disgrace. Such a disgrace. Such a disgrace. We must pass comprehensive election reforms and we must do it now. The democrats use the China virus as an excuse to change all of the election rules without the approval of their state legislatures, making it therefore illegal. It had a massive impact on the election. Again, you have to go to the legislatures to get these approvals. This alone would have easily changed the outcome of the election at levels that you wouldn’t have even believed. Even with COVID, even with all of the things, the numbers are staggering. We can never let this or other abuses of the 2020 election be repeated or happen again. Can never let that happen again. You see what’s going on. We’ve been set back so greatly with other countries and with the world. We need election integrity and election reform immediately. Republicans should be the party of honest elections that can give everyone confidence in the future of our country. Without honest elections, who has confidence? Who has confidence? This issue is being studied and examined, but the reality is you cannot have a situation where ballots are indiscriminately pouring in from all over the country, tens of millions of ballots, where are they coming from? They’re coming all over the place. We’re illegal aliens and dead people are voting, and many other horrible things are happening that are too voluminous to even mention. But people know. I mean it’s being studied and the level of dishonesty is not to be believed. We have a very sick and corrupt electoral process that must be fixed immediately. This election was rigged and the supreme court and other courts didn’t want to do anything about it. Audience: You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. We did. Audience: You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. If you just take that one element where they didn’t go through a legislature, it’s illegal, you can’t do it. It’s in the constitution. They didn’t have the courage, the supreme court, they didn’t have the courage to act, but instead used process and lack of standing. I was told the President of the United States has no standing. It’s my election, it’s your election. We have no standing. We had almost 25 … if you think of it … we had almost 20 states go into the supreme court so that we didn’t have a standing problem. They rejected it. They rejected it. They should be ashamed of themselves for what they’ve done to our country. They didn’t have the guts or the courage to make the right decision. They didn’t want to talk about it. We had the case led by the great State of Texas. 18 States went in. “You don’t have standing.” Let’s not talk about it. They didn’t have the guts to do what should be done. And that’s on top of all of these other forms of cheating, but this is the most basic of all. They would have local courts and local politicians change the rules in some cases a day or two before the election. This should never be allowed to happen to another presidential candidate or presidential race, should never be allowed to happen. Today I want to outline the steps that we must take to have an election system in this country that is honest, fair, and accurate. We need one election day, not 45, 30. One day, like it’s been. And the republicans don’t get this, and the other things I’m going to say, that you should, like the supreme court, be ashamed of yourselves. One day. One day. And the only people that should be allowed to vote by mail are people that can be proven to be either very sick or out of the country or military where they can’t do it. One day. They have millions and millions of ballots sitting around all over the place for long periods of time. Gee, I wonder what happens with those ballots? I wonder what happens. It’s common sense. It’s a disgrace. It’s an absolute disgrace. There should be a legitimate reason for someone to vote absentee, has to have a reason. We should eliminate the insanity of the mass and very corrupt mail-in voting. We must have voter ID. voter ID. To get into the Democratic National Convention, when they had the convention, you needed voter ID. You needed an ID card. You couldn’t get it unless you had an ID. So many people told me, “You can’t get in that place. You need ID. Nobody had ID.” You need voter ID. They know that. This is a con job. They’re conning everybody. They know that. They know the wall was good. They knew the wall would work, but didn’t want to have it because we wanted. I made one big mistake in the world. I should have said, “We will not have a wall.” And then they would have said, “Let’s build a wall.” I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. I’m sorry. It took us a year and a half extra because of that mistake. “We will not have a wall.” “We need a wall immediately,” said Chuck Schumer. We need universal signature matching. They want to pass a bill where you don’t have to match signatures, where signatures don’t mean anything. Now they know it’s … just like with the wall, just like with voter ID, when you need to go into anything that’s Democrat run, you need it. But for voting, which is our most sacred institution, they don’t want to let you have it. There should be a 100% requirement to verify the citizenship of every person who votes and there must be a chain of custody protections for every ballot. Every ballot. And you saw what happened in Detroit and Philadelphia and many other places, swing states mostly. All over, but swing states mostly. You saw what happened. You saw what was going on. You saw that more people … you take a look at the votes, when you have more votes than you have people, that’s a problem, right? Is that a problem? We have a little problem adjusting in Detroit. We seem to have more votes than we have people, a lot more votes, and election changing number. We’re not talking about a number where you can’t … no, these aren’t election changing numbers. In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting. What’s that all about? What’s that all about? Cheating they say. Yeah, I’d say so. In the history of our country, and it has taken place for years in Pennsylvania and Detroit and various other places. But there’s tremendous, never like this, because they used COVID as a way of cheating. That’s what happened. And everybody knows it. Hundreds of thousands and millions of ballots. They used it as a way of getting what they’ve wanted for many years. And the republicans have to do something about it. They better do something about it. Our election process is worse than that in many cases of a third world country. You know that, you saw what was going on. Even if you consider nothing else, it is undeniable that election rules were illegally changed at the last minute in almost every swing state with the procedures rewritten by local politicians … you’re not allowed to do that … and local judges. They want more time, they want this, they want that. All done by local politicians or local judges, as opposed to state legislatures as required by the Constitution of the United States. And these are just numbers that are massive. These aren’t little numbers, these are numbers that in each state is a transformative number. It changes the outcome of the election. And it’s not close. Regardless of your political views, this should concern you as a constitutional matter. And the supreme court, again, didn’t have the guts or the courage to do anything about it. And neither did other judges. And democrats even admitted in Time- And Democrats even admitted in Time Magazine, which is, I would say on the liberal side. They just couldn’t hold it in. They had to brag about it, because what they did, they had to brag about it. They couldn’t do it. You’ve got to read this story. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster for our country that we can allow something so corrupt to happen. Read that article. I really encourage you. You read that article. Yet all of the election integrity measures in the world will mean nothing if we don’t have free speech and that’s where we’re at now. If Republicans can be censored for speaking the truth and calling out corruption, we will not have democracy and we will have only left wing tyranny. And we can do this. We can do this. We’re smarter than they are. We’re tougher than they are. For some reason we just don’t… we don’t get it done. We let them attack our businesses and we don’t attack their businesses. I believe your numbers are bigger than their numbers, but you’re nicer than they are. You’re not as vicious as they are. In the past, we would debate. I would have it. I debate. You’ve seen me for many years. They throw something. I debate. They debate. Who knows who wins? People go. They vote. They see what happens. But they would have an idea. They would disagree. The public would hear it. The debate and discourse would take place. And then somebody would make a decision. You would win. You would lose. The public would make up its mind. But now there isn’t a debate because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard. They don’t want debate because we have easy victories in a debate, very easy victories. It’s called common sense. It’s called other things, but it’s called common sense. So they don’t want to debate. The time has come to break up big tech monopolies and restore fair competition. Republicans, conservatives must open up more platforms and repeal Section 230 Liability Protection. And if the federal government refuses to act, then every state in the union where we have the votes… which is a lot of them… Big tech giants, like Twitter, Google and Facebook should be punished with major sanctions whenever they silence conservative voices. And Governor Ron Desantis of Florida, and in Texas and other states are doing this. If they do what they’re doing, Florida… And that legislation will pass and Texas and others will have tremendous power to do what’s right and what’s fair. We have no time to waste. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are racing to pass a flagrantly unconstitutional attack on the First Amendment and the integrity of our elections known as HR One. Do you know what HR one is? It’s a disaster. Their bill would drastically restrict political speech, empower the federal government to shut down dissent and turn the federal election commission into a partisan political weapon. In addition, it virtually eliminates voter ID requirements nationwide. Effectively ends all registration deadlines. Can you believe this? Requires states to give ballots to felons. Automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote and puts unaccountable unelected bureaucrats in charge of drawing congressional districts. That’s going to be a lot of fun. This monster must be stopped. It cannot be allowed to pass. Now more than ever is the time for tough, strong, and energetic Republican leaders who have spines of steel. We need strong leadership. We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country. Instead of attacking me and more importantly, the voters of our movement, top establishment Republicans in Washington should be spending your energy and opposing Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and the Democrats. I’ve said to some of them, I said, “You know, during the Obama years, and now during Biden, if you spent the same energy on attacking them, you’d actually be successful as you do on attacking me in many cases.” The Democrats don’t have grand-standers like Mitt Romney, little Ben Sasse, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey; and in the House, Tom Rice, South Carolina, Adam Kinzinger, Dan Newhouse, Anthony Gonzalez. That’s another beauty. Fred Upton, Jamie Herrera Butler, Peter Meyer, John Katko, David Valadeo. And of course the warmonger, a person that loves seeing our troops fighting, Liz Cheney. How about that? The good news is in her state, she’s been censured. And in her state, her poll numbers have dropped faster than any human being I’ve ever seen. So hopefully, they’ll get rid of her with the next election. Get rid of them all. Democrats are vicious. Remember this. It’s true. Democrats are vicious. He said evil. Well, there is evil there, but they’re vicious. They’re smart. And they do one thing. You’ve got to hand it to them. They always stick together. You don’t have Mitt Romney’s in the group. They always stick together. Fortunately for the Republican party, the Democrats have horrible policies like open borders, sanctuary cities, defunding the police and the ridiculous, totally ridiculous Green New Deal. So they stick together. They’re smart. They’re vicious. They’ve got everything going, but their policies are no good. So hence we have, congratulations, the Republican Party. After this, they may not stick with those policies. We have to be careful. No, their policies are horrible. Think of it. Defund the police. How did that work out? But the Republicans do not stick together. The RINOs that we’re surrounded with will destroy the Republican Party and the American worker and will destroy our country itself. The RINOs, Republican in name only. But the Republican Party is united. The only division is between a handful of Washington, DC, establishment, political hacks, and everybody else all over the country. I think we have tremendous unity. When you look at the crowds outside that want your seat so badly. They will take your seat in two seconds. They want your seat. Congratulations. Congratulations on getting in, by the way. I’m very proud. And that’s why I’m announcing that I will be actively working to elect strong, tough and smart Republican leaders. Speaking of that, I heard Jim Jordan did a great job. I heard that from Mark Meadows. I heard it. Oh, there he is. Look at that. Hi Jim. I heard you were great. In fact, I hated to follow you. I want to follow other people. I could name them too. I like to follow other people. I heard you were great. Thank you, Jim, very much. Jim Jordan, great, great athlete. People don’t know he was a great wrestler, tremendous numbers of victories. The NC… He was a champion. He was college champion for a long period of time. He’s a winner and a leader and he doesn’t play games. He likes to win. He likes to win. And we have a lot of people in our party that like to win, Jim. Right? But I heard you were great. Thank you very much. We want Republican leaders who are loyal to the voters and who will work proudly for the vision that I’ve laid out today. And what is it? So simple. So simple. Military, law and order, great trade deals, great education. So simple. I don’t know. Does anybody get it? What are they doing? Does anybody get it? It has just been stated that President Trump’s endorsement is the most powerful asset in politics. You believe that? Who would’ve thought that was going to happen? Who would’ve thought that was going to happen, Jim? In last year’s congressional primaries, 120… Listen to this. It’s crazy. 120 of 122 candidates I endorsed won… 120. That’s almost as good as Jim’s wrestling record. And the two that lost were beaten by people claiming to be more Trump than their opponent. So I like those two people very much also. In the Senate, I was undefeated in endorsements with a record of 21 and 0. My endorsement of Mitch McConnell, at his request… It’s all right. It’s all right. He made a request. He asked for my endorsement. Brought him from one point down to 20 points up and he won his race in the great state and actually the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. And he won it. And he won it very easily. And I said, “I wonder if I’m doing the right thing here?” But you know what? I did… I did what I did. But he went from one point down to 20 points up very quickly, immediately actually. And he won his race. And if you compare that to his other elections, I’m sure you’ll see something interesting. But you know what? We got a Republican elected. And now we have to use Republicans to take care of the election frauds and all of the other things that are happening that shouldn’t be allowed to happen in our country. It’s very simple. Because of my efforts campaigning, we had huge gains in the House. And I helped keep many senators in their seats and they will admit it. So that it’s now 50/50, instead of Republicans being down anywhere from eight to 10 seats. And they’ll admit it. We’d be down eight to 10 seats if I didn’t campaign. We held rallies for some of the senators that went down and nobody talks about that. Nobody wants to talk. The press doesn’t talk about it. With me at the top of the ticket, not a single Republican member of Congress lost their race. For the first time in decades, we won 26 of 26 toss up races, toss ups. Think of that, 26 of 26. And those are toss ups. Those are races that could go any way. We were expected to lose 25 seats. And instead we won 15 seats and almost… Oh, why couldn’t we have done a couple of more? Almost cost Crazy Nancy her job. We’ll do that the next time around. I received almost… Listen to this number. Because the fake news doesn’t ever talk about these numbers. I just heard this one for the first time. I received almost 1.5 million more votes than all of the Republican House candidates combined. So how the hell is it possible that we lost? It’s not possible. I got more votes. I got more. And which it isn’t just me. When I say, “I,” I am talking about we. We, we got more votes than any incumbent, any incumbent president in the history of our country, almost 75 million votes. And that doesn’t include the votes and ballots they threw out. If you include them, you’ll see numbers that are much different. We did even better in the second election than we did in the first. I won the first. We won the second. We did much better. Sort of strange, right? “How did you do?” “Well we did much better the second time.” “Oh, you did, really?” What a disgrace, what a disgrace to our country. I got over 11 million, very close to 12 million more votes than we got in 2016. And I was told by John McLaughlin that if… a great poster… That if you get to si- we had 63 in 2016, 63 million. “Sir, if you get to 66 million you have it made.” We got to almost 75 million and what the hell happened? What happened? What happened when they closed all of the counting booths? What happened at three o’clock in the morning? What happened at 3:02 in the morning? What happened? No President has ever lost an election after carrying Florida, Ohio, and Iowa. And I won them all and I won them by a lot, by a lot. I won 94% of the primary vote. No incumbent President who received more than 75% of the primary vote has ever lost an election. I had a record number. And no President has ever, ever… We’re talking about a much lower number than we got… Has ever lost an election. Thanks to my coattails… Thank you. We have to have a sense of humor. Thanks to my coattails, democrats failed to flip a single state legislature… Think of it… Or a legislative chamber because Republicans came out to vote for me. Now they say it differently. The press, the fake news spins it differently. They say, “Despite how well they did, Trump didn’t win.” That’s such a lie. And many legislators, many legislators told me, they said, they’re going to lose their race. Wasn’t going to happen. And then what happened is one in particular told me from a great swing state said, “You know, I thought I was going to lose my position, lose my race. And I went out with my wife the night before the election. And I saw all these Trump signs and the American flags and the spirit on the streets. I said, ‘You know, darling, I think we’re going to win.’”He said, “But you were far, far, far more popular than me.” They do lots of polls. “You were way, way ahead of me, sir. And the next day I was right.” He said he won the election by a lot, “And you lost the election. And sir, it’s not possible that you lost because you’ve got a lower number than I did. And you were so far ahead of me. You are the person that brought everybody out to vote.” And I happen to agree with that 1,000%. Never forget that conversation. He couldn’t believe it. And I’ve it from more than one. And in November, 18 of 19 Bellwether County’s… You heard about the Bellwether County’s… 18 of 19 Bellwether County’s that have correctly predicted every Presidential election for decades, many decades, voted for Trump, not for Biden. And it was a shocker to those people that go for the stats. It was a shocker. They voted for Trump. 18 of 19 voted for Trump. There’s never been anything like that. And yet, did Biden win? No. If you want to help us take back the future of our country, go to donaldjtrump.com. I don’t do this. I’ve never done this. But it’s time that we have to put forces together because these people with their big tech and the fake news media right back there. Okay. And when you talk about election, they turn off. When you talk about… They probably have them going, because they also care about ratings. But when they talk about election, they turn off the cameras. You know why? It’s a very sore subject. Okay? They don’t like that subject. There’s only one way to contribute to our efforts, to elect America first Republican conservatives. And in turn, to make America great again. And that’s through Save America PAC and donaldjtrump.com. So go out there and do whatever you can because we’re going to help a lot of great people. We know the right people to help. We need your help to win and to fight big tech and the radical left and the DC establishment. We need to save your Second Amendment, which is under siege. We need to help protect funding for our military and for our great vets. And that’s what we’re doing. As we discussed earlier, we’re in a struggle for the survival of America as we know it. This is a struggle. This is a terrible, terrible, painful struggle. The path ahead will not be easy, but we will win. We are going to win. Ultimately we always win. And when we do, history will show that this was the moment when we could have given up, when we could have despaired, but instead we chose to keep on pushing forward. The greater the challenge and tougher the task, the more determined we must be to pull through to triumph. We have to have triumph. We have to have victory. With the talent and dedication of everyone here today… And you have tremendous, not only dedication, tremendous talent in this room. I know many of you. That is exactly what we will do. We will go on to victory. We will summon the spirit of generations of American patriots before us, like those heroes who crossed the Delaware, conquered the Rockies, stormed the beaches, won the battles and tamed the unknown frontiers. We will persist and we will prevail. We’re tougher than they are. We’re stronger than they are. Together, in the coming years, we will carry forward the torch of American liberty. We will lead the conservative movement and the Republican Party back to a totally conclusive victory. And we’ve had tremendous victories. Don’t ever forget it. With your help, we will take back the House. We will win the Senate. And then a Republican President will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be? I wonder who that will be. Who, who will that be? I wonder. Standing before you today, I am supremely confident that for our movement, for our party and for our country, our brightest days are just ahead. And that together we will make America prouder, freer, stronger and greater than it ever has been before. Thank you, CPAC. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.

Judge Rules Arizona County Must Turn Over 2.1 Million Ballots For ‘Real Audit’,27 FEB 2021,9766,"In Arizona, patriots are fighting to prove that the largest county (controlled by democrats) rigged the election for Joe Biden. And, a judge has agreed that the evidence is overwhelming. Just the News reported: A judge ruled Friday that  Arizona’s Maricopa County must provide roughly 2.1 million ballots from the Nov. 3 election to the state Senate and allow the chamber to access its election equipment to conduct an audit, according to news reports. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason ruled that subpoenas issued by the state Senate are valid and should be enforced. Thomason also disputed arguments from county officials the Senate subpoenas are unlawful, according to the Epoch Times. The county has argued that previous, multiple audits are sufficient and that the ballots should be sealed. “The Court finds that the subpoenas are legal and enforceable,” Thomason wrote in his ruling, obtained by The Times. “There is no question that the Senators have the power to issue legislative subpoenas. The subpoenas comply with the statutory requirements for legislative subpoenas. The Senate also has broad constitutional power to oversee elections.” Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, a Republican, told news outlets after the judge’s ruling that their move was “never about overturning the election, it was about the integrity of the Arizona election system.” Whether the Maricopa Board of Supervisors will appeal the judge’s decision remains unclear.   The AZ Mirror added: The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors must turn over ballots and tabulation machines to Senate Republican leaders so they can conduct an audit of the 2020 general election, a judge ruled. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason ruled on Friday that it was within the Senate’s authority to subpoena the materials and equipment so it can audit the election. The ruling brings a potential conclusion to the months-long battle between the supervisors and the Senate. “The Court finds that the Subpoenas are legal and enforceable,” Thomason wrote in his ruling.  After meeting with their attorneys, the supervisors decided to not appeal the ruling. Supervisor Jack Sellers, the board’s chairman, said the ruling “brings clarity to whether Senate subpoenas apply to ballots that, per state law, must be kept private following an election.” “We respect his legal opinion and will immediately start working to provide the Arizona Senate with the ballots and other materials,” Sellers said in a press statement. “We hope senators will show the same respect and care we have for the 2.1 million private ballots and use them in service of their legislative duties.” Senate President Karen Fann and two successive Senate Judiciary Committee chairmen issued subpoenas for nearly 2.1 million ballots, around 300 tabulation machines and a trove of other data and materials. They sought to conduct an audit of the election in response to the baseless fraud allegations and conspiracy theories espoused by former President Donald Trump and many of his supporters, including some Senate Republicans, after President Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. “We are very, very thrilled and grateful for the judge to look at the big picture and recognize that this was never about overturning any election. This was always about voter integrity and the integrity of the voting system itself,” Fann, a Prescott Republican, told the Arizona Mirror. The dispute began in December, when then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Eddie Farnsworth held a six-hour hearing to question county officials about the conduct of the election. Even though the hearing turned up no evidence of any fraud, malfeasance or misconduct in the way Maricopa County conducted the election, Farnsworth and Fann issued the first round of subpoenas, prompting a lawsuit from the supervisors. Sen. Warren Petersen re-issued the subpoenas in January after he succeeded Farnsworth as the committee’s chairman. Maricopa County challenged the subpoenas in court, arguing that it would be illegal to turn over the ballots to anyone, citing state laws requiring ballots to go under lock and key for two years once an election is canvassed. And the supervisors said it would jeopardize the certification of its ballot tabulation machines to allow an unaccredited or unqualified auditor to examine them. Thomason rejected the county’s arguments that the ballots must be kept secured after the election and cannot be released, and said confidentiality laws clearly weren’t intended to prevent government officials from doing their jobs. The fact that state law requires the county treasurer to keep the ballots for 24 months suggests that they may be subject to subpoenas or investigations, the judge wrote. Thomason also noted that, under the county’s logic, it would be violating the law because the Board of Supervisors is holding onto the ballots rather than turning them over to the county treasurer while the litigation proceeds. And the judge said the right to a secret ballot, enshrined in the Arizona Constitution, isn’t jeopardized by the subpoenas because there is no way to determine which voter is tied to any given ballot. As for the tabulation machines, Thomas said confidentiality laws don’t apply to them and provide no justification for withholding the equipment and machinery. Thomason also found that the Senate had a valid legislative purpose in demanding the ballots. The Arizona Constitution empowers the legislature to pass “laws to secure the purity of elections and guard against abuses of the elective franchise,” and it’s a valid legislative purpose for lawmakers to issue the subpoenas to gauge the “accuracy and efficacy of existing vote tabulation systems and competence of county officials in performing their election duties, with an eye to introducing possible reform proposals,” the judge wrote. Even if one of the initial purposes of the subpoenas was to determine whether the results of the election could be challenged, as the county alleged, other legitimate purposes exist, Thomason ruled. And because Biden has already been sworn into office, the results of the election cannot be overturned. All 16 Senate Republicans co-sponsored a resolution to find the supervisors in contempt for defying the subpoenas, which authorized Fann to have all five of them arrested and could have potentially led to misdemeanor charges. But the resolution fell one vote short when Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, opposed it, saying he wanted to give the county more time to sort out the legal issues.  Petersen, a Gilbert Republican, later introduced legislation that would expressly authorize legislative chambers and committees to subpoena ballots and other election equipment and materials, and specifies that the legislature has the right to investigate any matter it wants. The Senate has approved the legislation, which now awaits action in the House of Representatives.  While the legal battle ensued, the Board of Supervisors conducted its own audits of the election machines. Maricopa County’s ballot tabulation machines are provided by Dominion Voting Systems, the nation’s second-largest provider of such equipment, which has been the subject of many conspiracy theories and false allegations since Trump lost the election.  The audits gave the machines and their software a clean bill of health, finding that they weren’t connected to the internet during the election, weren’t hacked or infected with any malicious software, and hadn’t switched any votes during the counting of ballots. The audits were conducted by SLI Compliance and Pro V&V Laboratories, the only two companies accredited by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to certify and examine tabulation machines. Fann has taken issue with the two companies because they had previously certified Dominion’s machines and software. She had looked to hire Allied Systems Operations Group, a Texas company whose employees had served as witnesses for the Trump campaign during various legislative hearings about the election and have a well-documented history of spreading false claims about election fraud in Arizona and other swing states that voted for Biden. The Senate’s legal counsel told attorneys for Maricopa County that ASOG would serve under another auditor. The Senate drafted a proposed scope of work for ASOG, a step it has not taken for any other prospective auditors. Fann told the Mirror that she is considering several potential auditors, though she said ASOG likely will not be one of them because some people believe it would not be independent. “I think that would be difficult for anyone to select them at that point, just because of the perception out there. However, I do believe they’re fully qualified. However, there’s a perception that they would not be fully independent,” Fann said. Phil Waldron, an ASOG employee and member of its proposed auditing team in Arizona, falsely alleged during a November meeting in Phoenix that Maricopa County election workers don’t verify the signatures on early ballot envelopes, and claimed, without evidence and despite not having inspected the tabulation machines, that the machines were connected to the internet during the vote count. Waldron claimed, without evidence, during a recent report by right-wing cable channel One America News Network that hundreds of thousands of ballots cast in-person in Maricopa County on Election Day were “shifted” to become “absentee ballots” as ballots were counted in the days after the election. During a legislative hearing in Georgia, Waldron claimed fraudulent ballots were trucked into the state to rig the vote for Biden, though he was unable to provide any evidence under questioning to back up his assertion. "
The JoeBama Pelosi ‘Pay Off’ Outlined: Democrats Are Desperate To Refill Their Coffers With Taxpayer $$,26 FEB 2021,7244,"The COVID ‘bailout’ Bill has nothing to do with health (there’s no need anyway) and everything to do with democrats desperately needing to refill their dwindling coffers with abundant taxpayer dollars. Conservative Treehouse reported: Saying ‘we toldyaso‘ is never a good look; however, sometimes -as with the 2015 splitter strategy within the big club- and in combination with the preceding prediction, it is the only way to convince people to accept the reality of how Machiavellian the professional political class, the DC elite, has become. As we contemplate the $1.9 trillion state and union bailout bill that JoeBama and Nancy Pelosi are presenting, it is worth looking back to December 5, 2020, when CTH predicted the exact path Biden and Pelosi would travel. “The Election Fraud, The Usefulness of COVID and The Big Picture“ […] The COVID-19 narrative becomes a tool to achieve a variety of objectives: debate controls; the deployed ‘excuse‘ for a very visible lack of voter enthusiasm for the puppet (Biden); the use of fraudulent ‘mail-in ballots’; the keeping of socially distant physical auditors, etc.  Without COVID as a tool, the manufactured process is more difficult. The ‘never let a crisis go to waste‘ strategy includes the creation of a crisis. Why? – Why all of this effort?… why such extremes?… why would blue state governors willingly destroy their economy?….  Follow the money, it’s always about the money. The global ideology is worthless without money.   Wall Street’s Rick Santelli knows, he’s watching the second deployment of an identical playbook. So when your friends ask why, let’s talk about ‘why‘. The response to the opportunity of the financial crisis of 2007/2008 was all about using the housing market collapse to create a financial mechanism to bail-out Blue Team members. TARP, Auto-bailouts, QE1, QE2, and the stimulus packages were specifically directed to the controlled crony capitalists who funded the rise of the previous tool, Barack Obama. In 2009 the orcs were deployed.  Beyond the Wall Street crowd, the SEIU, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, NEA were some of the more visible politically activist beneficiaries.  There was a massive hole in the U.S. economy and all the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds were specifically targeted to ensure the Blue Team did not suffer. Winners and losers were selected.  Overall Main Street didn’t get a dime. In 2020, we are seeing the exact same operational execution around COVID-19.  This time the crisis is a virus and the planned primary beneficiaries are the Blue Team states and their collapsing and unstable financial mechanisms. The American electorate (writ large) would never support targeted taxpayer-funded bailouts to Blue State beneficiaries.  As a consequence, the crisis needs to hit Main Street so that public support for massive bailouts can be accepted. Nancy Pelosi sets up the proposal, takes the accounting of the Blue Team needs, and sits down with inside party club members to organize the funding mechanisms. Obviously, all of this big picture outcome is contingent upon the successful execution of President Trump’s removal… hence, the firm-reliance on election fraud.  The transparency of the fraud needs to be obfuscated, denied, and ridiculed; that’s where the media come in. Meanwhile, Blue State teams work earnestly to create a worsening financial crisis for the American electorate, the workers, and business owners.  Shutting down the economy is part of a coordinated effort. When do both wings of the UniParty bird most visibly flap in unison? ANSWER: When they get to the part of the playbook where ‘their tribe’ starts positioning for the trough. Yes, COVID-19 as a weapon has many benefits… including the purposefully convenient stopping of assemblies, crowds and visible public opposition as the larger schemes are deployed hastily. BIG TECH steps-in to assist the goal of isolating the electorate by shutting down voices and keeping people isolated from larger community understanding.  Communication lines are cut, as they would be in any war strategy.  Dividing people has many benefits. As soon as enough pressure is applied to Main Street, the electorate get desperate. There will be an outcry for help and that is where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is waiting in the wings with the previously constructed bailout package that the American people will now be more apt to support.  Opposition voices will be framed as heartless; the media will immediately jump into action, and we go right into that cycle where fearful people do not stop to recognize the financial strategy as it is carried out. The Blue Team state bailout will come at the top of a massive 2020 COVID federal spending package. As with the previous 2009 spending package, it will be gift-wrapped in paper to appear like Main Street is a beneficiary… However, just like the ARRA, there will be no ‘shovel ready jobs‘ saved or created.  It is all a ruse for a transfer of taxpayer wealth. The weaponization of COVID is the ongoing crisis that will facilitate government solutions.  As the American people resist the bait represented by the COVID crisis, those who need to weaponize it will keep turning up the pressure. That pressure will continue until the American people can no longer take it and will accept the solution.  We are watching the deployment of an identical playbook used previously to bail-out Wall Street, Big Banks, and political benefactors/beneficiaries in 2009. …And the great reset begins. That’s the why.   The Daily Caller added: The House of Representatives passed the Equality Act on Thursday afternoon, which will impact abortion, marriage, family, gender, sports, and more. In a 224-206 vote, the House passed the Equality Act. H.R. 5 would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act in order to prevent “discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.” Three Republicans voted with Democrats in favor of the Equality Act. The act would mandate that individuals cannot be denied access to the locker room of their choice. “An individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual’s gender identity,” according to the bill’s text. Democrats tried to pass the Equality Act in 2019, but it was killed by a Republican-controlled Senate. THESE THREE REPUBLICANS VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE EQUALITY ACT:  In 2019, there were eight House Republicans who voted in favor of the Equality Act, including Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, Texas Rep. Will Hurd, Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, and New York Reps. John Katko, Tom Reed, and Elise Stefanik, Fox News reported. (RELATED: Here’s What’s In The Equality Act) The legislation will now head to the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to avoid a filibuster. President Joe Biden promised to pass the Equality Act during his first 100 days of office in October 2020 when he was still the Democratic nominee. (RELATED: Biden Vows To Pass ‘Equality Act’ During His First 100 Days In Office) Biden also said he would make sure LGBTQ equality is a focus of United States diplomacy before he was elected."
"Democrats Pass ‘Equality Act’ Destroying Women’s Sports, Defying Science",26 FEB 2021,7668,"People who suffer from gender dysphoria have a mental illness, experts agree. Moreover, basic, fundamental science shows that there are two genders. But democrats passed the “Equality Act” yesterday that ignores both facts. While people are literally starving, Dems just made sure that women’s sports have been destroyed. Biological males will now ‘win’ all competitions. The Epoch Times reported: House Democrats approved the Equality Act of 2021 the afternoon of Feb. 25 following a rancorous debate in which Republicans said the controversial bill will significantly narrow the scope of religious freedom if it becomes law. The Equality Act provides prohibits discrimination due to gender identity or sexual orientation. Three Republicans joined all 221 Democrats in the lower chamber to support its passage, while the remaining 208 Republicans opposed the proposal, which was approved as expected. The three GOPers voting with the Democrats included John Katko and Tom Reed of New York, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. A similar version of the bill was approved by the Democratic House in 2019, but it failed to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate. Passage in the Senate is again somewhat in doubt as the upper chamber is evenly split between the two parties, with Vice-President Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who supports the proposal, to cast the deciding vote in the event of a tie. The House debate got hot almost as soon as it started. Only a few minutes in, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) branded as “ridiculous” Republican claims that the bill represents a threat to religious freedom. Maloney also argued that Republicans “believe LBGTQ are morally inferior,” and taunted the measure’s opponents for “their real argument, that is, they are pro-discrimination against gay people.” Maloney’s angry outburst prompted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), floor manager of the opposition ranks during the 90-minute debate to stand, to hold up a sheaf of paper and declare: “Here it is, on page 25. It says specifically, ‘The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993 shall not provide a legal basis for a claim’ [against a discrimination charge]. “The founders said in the first right, in the First Amendment to the Constitution, you can practice your religion as you see fit. But right here in their bill today, the Democrats say ‘No you can’t.’” Jordan’s citation from the bill text, however, didn’t change the tone of the discussion, as a few minutes later in the debate, Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), turned to the Republicans and shouted: “You used God to enslave my poor parents. You used God to segregate me in the schools. You used God to put me in the back of the bus. Have you no shame?” Similarly, Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) declared near the end of the debate that the religious freedom arguments presented by the Republican opposition were “transphobia,” “homophobia,” and “hate.” The 500-plus page bill redefines “public accommodation” in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include “any establishment” that provides a service, including churches, homeless shelters operated by religious groups, adoption agencies, and educational institutions associated with faith-based denominations and associations. And, as Jordan pointed out, the bill explicitly sets aside a provision of RFRA that specifically protects the right of religious groups to conduct their activities and manage their affairs according to their beliefs. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), manager of the bill’s supporters, responded to the GOP’s RFRA argument that he was a co-sponsor of the bill when it was approved by Congress. He said the Equality Act “does not contradict religious freedom, but it does enshrine equality, and that’s what they seem to be afraid of.” Republicans repeatedly noted during the debate that the bill was brought to the floor for debate and final passage without any prior hearings in committees that would have allowed opponents and supporters to bring forward witnesses and evidence to support their arguments. “Unfortunately, this is another bill which didn’t go through the committee process or real debate. The judiciary committee should have had an opportunity to consider H.R. 5 in a legislative hearing,” Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) said. “I am not sure why we even bother to have committees when we pass significant legislation without them.” Following the vote, Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) issued a statement saying, “All people should be treated with respect and no one should face discrimination in their daily lives, but this extreme bill would erode our nation’s progress toward women’s equality and threaten religious liberty enshrined in the First Amendment. “If enacted, it will have real-world consequences such as biological men participating in women’s athletics. It is shocking that Democrats think this is good for society and a political priority.” Also after the vote, Kristen Waggoner, General Counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Phoenix, Arizona-based public interest advocacy group, said in an emailed statement: “The freedom to live peaceably according to our beliefs is a fundamental right, resting in our human dignity and codified by the First Amendment. Any legislation that hides behind ‘equality’ or ‘fairness’ but undermines these constitutional freedoms is misguided, at best, and hostile, at worst. “The House has irresponsibly bypassed the committee process and curtailed debate over this sweeping and coercive legislation. In short, Congress has no business forcing every American to agree with a controversial government-imposed ideology on sexuality or be treated as an outlaw. We ask the Senate to reject this dangerous bill, for the good of all Americans.” Prior to the debate, religious freedom advocates interviewed by The Epoch Times said the measure, if it becomes law, will put religious institutions at a serious disadvantage in federal and state courts when facing discrimination allegations. “Equality Act would eviscerate the protection offered by federal law for those Americans who seek to live out their faith in their schools, businesses, and communities, relegating people of faith to lower-class status,” Mike Berry, General Counsel for the First Liberty Institute, told The Epoch Times. Berry’s public interest religious liberty law firm is based in Plano, Texas. “Religious and nonprofit schools that violate the bill could lose their tax-exempt status and schools could lose accreditation—which means they could not accept student loans and many graduates would not be able to be accepted into graduate schools,” Liberty Counsel said in an analysis of the bill released Feb. 24. “The expanse of the bill includes church and college overnight stays with youth and/or students, dorms, sports, bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers,” the Orlando, Florida, based public interest religious liberty law firm said. Liberty Counsel also predicted in a separate statement issued Feb. 25 that passage would represent a serious blow to women’s sports, as protected by Title IX of 1972. “Title IX was created in order to ensure that women had access to equal opportunities as men, including in sports. Now that is threatened as H.R. 5 ignores the biological differences between male and female and erases the unique talents and achievements of girls and women,” the Liberty Counsel analysis said. “Allowing biological males who self-identify as ‘women’ to compete against biological females, puts women at a disadvantage and can cost female athletes the titles, records, and scholarships that are rightfully theirs and can even lead to serious sports-related injuries.”  "
Biden Keeps Kids In Cages: Watch Circle Back’s Pathetic Attempt To Justify Hypocrisy,24 FEB 2021,2818,"The Obama administration actually kept kids in cages, but President Trump was blamed for it (using pictures from the Obama years) by the left. Now, Biden is also caging children, but apparently, it’s different…. The Gateway Pundit reported: The Biden administration opened a gated migrant facility for illegal immigrant children this past weekend in Carrizo Springs, Texas. The camp will hold up to 700 illegal immigrant children. The facility was open for one month during the Trump years and then it was shut down. Democrats were very, very upset about caged kids during Trump’s tenure. They completely ignored it under Obama. The need to hold illegal alien children in compounds is the direct result of reversing President Trump’s highly successful border policies, which they described as “hardline.” And now, here we are again. USA Today has more on the facility. The facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas, will house up to 700 migrant children within the next two weeks, according to a statement Tuesday from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for migrant children. The temporary Influx Care Facility will be used for children ages 13 and older who have been medically cleared of COVID-19, the statement said. The move came after Joe Biden signed a raft of executive orders aimed at unwinding the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, including establishing a task force to reunify children separated from their parents or guardians at the border under former President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy. As he seeks to fulfill his campaign promise to swiftly undo Trump’s immigration actions, Biden is facing hurdles because of the rise in migrant apprehensions at the Southwest border and reduced capacity at facilities over COVID-19 concerns. Democrats lied over and over about the kids in cages meme during the Trump years.
Now they’ll just ignore it. More… Dummy AOC took the lie to new heights. It’s not an issue when Democrats are in charge. The Gateway Pundit also reported: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday got very testy with Fox News’ Peter Doocy when he asked about the Biden Admin’s policy of putting migrant children in cages. The Biden administration opened a gated migrant facility for illegal immigrant children this past weekend in Carrizo Springs, Texas. The camp will hold up to 700 illegal immigrant children. The facility was open for one month during the Trump years and then it was shut down. Democrats like AOC went ballistic about caged kids during Trump’s tenure. Democrats completely ignored it under Obama and now they’re defending it under Biden. Psaki said that putting migrant kids in cages is not putting kids in cages because we are in the middle of a pandemic."
TRACE Act (H.R. 6666) To ‘Mobilize’ Widespread “Contact Tracing” Swab Testing Gains Speed,22 FEB 2021,2455,"Democrat Bobby Rush introduced H.R. 6666 last May, but now that democrats control the legislature and executive branch, the contact tracing and mobilized testing bill is gaining new attention. The Representative’s website explained: On May 1, U.S. Representative Bobby L. Rush introduced H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act. This bipartisan bill would establish a grant program run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fully mobilize coronavirus testing and contact tracing efforts.  Grantees would include Community Health Centers, School Based Health Centers, academic medical centers, non-profits, and other entities who would hire and train individuals to operate mobile testing units, as well as outreach in hot spots and medically underserved areas. “Reopening our economy and getting back to normal will be all but impossible if we do not step up our testing efforts and implement robust and widespread contact tracing,” said Rep. Rush.  “Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this. “The COVID-19 TRACE Act will allow us to do this by creating a $100 billion dollar grant program for local organizations to hire, train, and pay individuals and to purchase supplies to run mobile testing units and door-to-door outreach as is safe and necessary, with special preference being given to those operating in hot spots and medically underserved communities, as well as those entities who commit to hiring from these neighborhoods. “I am immensely proud to see this bill receive bipartisan support and I hope to see the COVID-19 TRACE Act swiftly adopted by the House as a stand-alone bill or as part of a larger coronavirus response package.” Entities eligible to receive funding through the COVID-19 TRACE Act grant program include but are not limited to: Does the COVID-19 TRACE Act require testing? If I test positive for coronavirus, will I be forced to quarantine? I saw online that the bill allows the government to enter my home and remove my children if we test positive for the virus.  Is that true? Why would they have to defend this so vehemently if this wasn’t a real threat? And does anyone really believe that a gigantic bureaucratic ‘program’ like this would actually be able to ensure the “safety” of anyone?"
"New York Begins Impeachment Process Against Cuomo Over COVID lies, Death Camps",20 FEB 2021,1792,"On Thursday, New York Assembly members began impeachment proceedings against Governor Cuomo. The Gateway Pundit reported: The Republican lawmakers announced a resolution to create an impeachment commission, the first step in the process of impeaching and ousting Cuomo. This announcement comes one day after New York Senate Democrats moved on Wednesday to strip Governor Andrew Cuomo of his Emergency pandemic powers. Newsweek reported: On Thursday, Assembly Republicans announced a resolution to create an impeachment commission consisting of eight bipartisan members of the legislature. The panel would have 60 days to conduct its work and submit its findings and recommendations to the state legislature. “The Cuomo Administration’s nursing home cover-up is one of the most alarming scandals we’ve seen in state government,” Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay said in a statement. “It is incumbent upon the Legislature to undertake a comprehensive, bipartisan review of the Cuomo Administration’s policies, decisions and actions on this matter and render a decision on what steps must be taken to hold the governor accountable.” The FBI and US Attorney in Brooklyn are reportedly investigating Governor Cuomo’s handling of nursing homes amid the Covid pandemic. Thousands of nursing home residents in New York died because of Andrew Cuomo’s edict ordering Covid patients back into the nursing homes. Last Thursday an audio was leaked of New York Governor Cuomo’s top aide apologizing to Democrat lawmakers for intentionally withholding the state’s COVID nursing home death toll from them. During a press conference on Monday, Cuomo blamed ‘conspiracy theories’ and ‘misinformation’ and said the nursing home scandal is a “political spin” while he threw healthcare workers under the bus."
"Biden Gives Wuhan Lab Taxpayer Funds Till 2024 While Also Collecting $750,000 In PPP ‘Loans’",19 FEB 2021,5153,"The Biden administration is busy sending tax dollars to all of America’s enemies, including the Wuhan Lab in China generally believed to have created and spread COVID. In addition to this, the lab also collected $750,000 in the PPP funds… this after Biden helped drug companies by revoking President Trump’s drug price reduction order. (Insulin went back to $500 for a monthly supply, under President Trump, it was $60.) The Daily Caller reported: The Wuhan Institute of Virology is authorized to receive taxpayer funding for animal research until January 2024, the National Institute of Health told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The WIV is at the center of widespread speculation that COVID-19 could have entered the human population in China due to an accidental lab leak. Researchers at the lab were studying bat-based coronaviruses prior to the outbreak, a project partially backed by $600,000 in U.S. taxpayer funds routed to the lab through the nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance. The president of EcoHealth Alliance, Peter Daszak, was the sole U.S. member of the World Health Organization delegation that investigated the origins of the pandemic on the ground in China in January and February. While the WHO delegation has yet to release a report on their findings, Daszak said the White House should blindly accept their conclusion that it’s highly unlikely the virus could have leaked from the WIV. Daszak also said American intelligence, which indicates researchers at the WIV became infected with COVID-like symptoms before the first known cases in December 2019, shouldn’t be trusted. EcoHealth Alliance’s work researching bat-based coronaviruses in China was funded by a $3.7 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 2014, according to The Wall Street Journal. The grant was terminated by the National Institutes of Health in April amid criticism over EcoHealth Alliance’s relationship with the WIV. The NIH said in a letter the nonprofit’s work in China did not align with “program goals and agency priorities.” The NIH told EcoHealth Alliance in July it would restore the grant if it met certain conditions, one of which was to arrange for an independent team to investigate the WIV to determine if it had possession of the SARS-COV-2 virus prior to the first known cases in December 2019. Daszak told NPR that the NIH’s conditions were “preposterous.” “I’m not trained as a private detective,” Daszak said. “It’s not really my job to do that.” However, the WIV still has an active Foreign Assurance on file with the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, which enables it to continue receiving taxpayer funds to engage in animal research, according to the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. A NIH spokeswoman told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the WIV’s Foreign Assurance was approved on Jan. 9, 2019, and is currently set to expire on Jan. 31, 2024. The spokeswoman did not confirm whether the WIV is currently receiving direct or indirect taxpayer funding for research activities involving animals. EcoHealth Alliance’s last known subgrant to the WIV was in May 2019, according to USASpending.Gov. EcoHealth Alliance received a new $7.5 million grant from the NIH to help establish a Centers for Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases. Daszak told NPR that the funds his organization received from the new grant will not be used for any research in China. The president of the nonpartisan watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, Anthony Bellotti, told the DCNF that EcoHealth Alliance should be defunded entirely for funding “reckless gain-of-function animal experiments that may have led to the COVID-19 pandemic.” “We’re urging Congress and the White House to defund EcoHealth now and secure independent investigations into whether their treacherous gain-of-function animal experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the COVID outbreak.” EcoHealth also got $750,000 in PPP loans. The national Pulse reported: EcoHealth Alliance – a controversial research group that partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology – took roughly $750,000 from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, which seeks to “aid small businesses in maintaining work force during COVID-19 pandemic,” is valued at $751,569. The quarter-million dollar sum received in the first round of PPP loans follows the nearly $110,000,000 in taxpayer funds the organization has received. But EcoHealth Alliance, founded by Chinese Communist Party-linked Peter Daszak, is profiting off a pandemic it likely helped to create. Ecohealth Alliance partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, believed by many to be the source of COVID-19, using taxpayer funds on research to study animal-based coronaviruses. A summary of the research reveals the discoveries “made in the lab unlocked a highly specific doorway into the human body” – the same doorway used by COVID-19. What’s more, a member of the recent World Health Organization (WHO) delegation to China, Daszak insisted it was “extremely unlikely” the virus was created in the Chinese lab."
Winter Storm Chaos: Catastrophic Fail For Texas ‘Clean’ Power Turbines As 2 Dead In Massive Outage,16 FEB 2021,8089,"Clean energy has failed Texans, four million who are without power this morning as wind turbines froze. Nice nice pic.twitter.com/97DrEr5SsF — Jack Posobiec  (@JackPosobiec) February 16, 2021 The Epoch Times reported: The brutal cold snap that crippled Texas’ power system and spread to other states, leading to blackouts in over four million homes and businesses, highlighted the growing vulnerability of the grid to increased dependency on less reliable sources of energy like wind and solar, an expert told NTD in an interview. Jason Isaac, a former state representative and current director of Life:Powered, a project of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that the power crisis spurred by the recent deep freeze exposed the fragility associated with the global push to ditch “reliable” fossil fuels in favor of “unreliable” renewables. “Reliable is our nuclear, our natural gas, and our coal,” Isaac said. “Natural gas and coal can ramp up or ramp down on demand,” he said. “They’re what’s referred to as ‘dispatchable energy.’” “Our ‘unreliables’ produce electricity when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. And then they freeze up at really cold temperatures, too,” he said. Isaac suggested that the surge in “unreliables” amounts to a subsidized takeoff of politically correct, but economically incorrect sources of energy. “Unfortunately, we’ve subsidized and depend too much on virtue signaling and really given these unreliables incredibly huge benefits over the last decade, and now those chickens are coming home to roost,” he said. Isaac said that the Council of Texas reported Monday that over half of the state’s windmills were completely shut down due to the recent deep freeze, which has seen temperatures plunge below zero. “These windmills are frozen, they’re completely shut down, and the rest of them are barely producing electricity,” Isaac said, adding that, at last check, only around 10 percent of their installed capacity was generating electricity. “That means if we had that kind of low number for natural gas, or coal or nuclear, we would have almost the entire state without electricity right now, but fortunately, we have reliables,” he said. The cold snap has also disrupted oil and gas deliveries, however, with more than a million barrels a day of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of gas production shut while pipelines have declared force majeure and massive refineries have halted gasoline and diesel output, according to Bloomberg. After millions in Texas lost electricity, Southwest Power Pool, the operator of the power grid spanning 14 states ordered utilities to start implementing rotating power outages. “In our history as grid operator, this is an unprecedented event and marks the first time SPP has ever had to call for controlled interruptions of service,” said SPP’s executive vice president and chief operating officer Lanny Nickell, in a statement. Calling it a “last resort,” Nickell said imposing the Level 3 energy emergency alert, which calls for rolling blackouts, had to be done to protect the power grid. “It’s a step we’re consciously taking to prevent circumstances from getting worse, which could result in uncontrolled outages of even greater magnitude,” he said. In a follow-up release, SPP said that it had restored full load to its 14-state region as of 2 p.m. Central Time but that, due to high load demand and persistent cold weather, the system would likely fluctuate over the next 48 hours between a Level 2 energy conservation alert and a Level 3 emergency that calls for rolling blackouts. Joe Biden has declared an emergency in Texas in connection with the power crisis. Under the measure, FEMA has been authorized to mobilize its equipment and resources to help alleviate the impact of the emergency, while protective measures for mass care and sheltering, as well as for direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott on Feb. 12 warned Texans to brace for a winter storm “unprecedented in Texas history” as he declared a disaster for the state. He urged Texans to reduce their energy usage as much as possible in order to conserve power. “Every part of the state will face freezing conditions over the coming days, and I urge all Texans to remain vigilant against the extremely harsh weather that is coming,” Abbott said in a statement. “Stay off the roads, take conscious steps to conserve energy, and avoid dangerous practices like bringing generators indoors or heating homes with ovens or stovetops. Our emergency response to this winter weather requires a collective approach between state agencies, local officials, and Texans throughout our communities to ensure the safety and security of the Lone Star State.” The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the nonprofit organization that operates the state’s power grid, suggested that residents set their thermostats to 68 degrees or lower where possible, close shades and blinds to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows, turn off and unplug nonessential lights and appliances, and avoid using large appliances such as ovens and washing machines. The Epoch Times added: As nightfall threatened to plummet temperatures again into single digits, officials warned that homes still without power would likely not have heat until at least Tuesday, as frustration mounted and the state’s electric grid came under growing demand and criticism. “Things will likely get worse before they get better,” said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in the county of nearly 5 million people around Houston. Law enforcement reported two men were found dead along Houston-area roadways. Causes of death were pending, but officials said the subfreezing temperatures were likely to blame. The toll of the worsening conditions included the delivery of new COVID-19 vaccine shipments, which were expected to be delayed until at least midweek. Massive power outages across Houston included a facility storing 8,000 doses of Moderna vaccine, leaving health officials scrambling to find takers at the same time authorities were pleading for people to stay home. Temperatures nosedived into the single-digits as far south as San Antonio, and homes that had already been without electricity for hours had no certainty about when the lights and heat would come back on, as the state’s overwhelmed power grid began imposing blackouts that are typically only seen in 100-degree Fahrenheit (38-degree Celsius) summers. The storm was part of a massive system that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains and was spreading across the Ohio Valley and to the Northeast. The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities across 14 states, called for rolling outages because the supply of reserve energy had been exhausted. Some utilities said they were starting blackouts, while others urged customers to reduce power usage. “We’re living through a really historic event going on right now,” said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, pointing to all of Texas under a winter storm warning and the extent of the freezing temperatures. … More than 500 people were hunkering down at one shelter in Houston, but Mayor Sylvester Turner said other warming centers had to be shut down because those locations, too, lost power. The largest grocery store chain in Texas, H-E-B, closed locations around Austin and San Antonio, cities that are unaccustomed to snow and have few resources to clear roads. The slow thaw and more frigid lows ahead was also taking a toll on Texas’ distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. … Most government offices and schools were closed for Presidents Day, and authorities pleaded with residents to stay home. Louisiana State Police reported that it had investigated nearly 75 weather-related crashes caused by a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain in the past 24 hours. “We already have some accidents on our roadways,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a morning news conference. “It is slick and it is dangerous.”"
Washington Distributed COVID Relief To Radical Political Groups Based On Race,15 FEB 2021,10198,"The state of Washington used COVID funds illegally, according to new reports, including perhaps a liberal slush fund to funnel cash to radical political groups. My Northwest reported: The Washington State Department of Commerce gave federal COVID relief tax dollars to non-profits pursuing radical political agendas. Tax dollars even went to indirectly bail criminals out of jail. The selection process for funding was based on race. And some of the vetting seems influenced more by ideology than by need. Secretary Lisa Brown’s Commerce Department aimed to “distribute COVID relief funds equitably to the communities hardest hit by the pandemic.” But to qualify to the Washington Equity Relief Fund, a group of “reviewers” made sure the nonprofits were “led by and serving Black, Indigenous and people of color.” In other words, if the nonprofit is run by majority white people or serve entire communities, it wouldn’t qualify for assistance. How equitable. Should federal tax dollars go to political nonprofits, chosen by hand-selected “reviewers” who share the political beliefs of the very non-profits they’re rewarding, all under the auspices of COVID relief? No. Radical organizations get COVID dollars Commerce partnered with Philanthropy Northwest (where the chair and two vice chairs appear to all be white) to award nearly $12 million in grants to Washington nonprofits. The funds were from the federal CARES Act. A group of over 100 peer reviewers discussed and scored applications before doling out funding, in collaboration with Commerce. The reviewers were “prioritized” on the basis of their race.  About 95% identified as a racial minority and 77% experienced poverty. Ironically, Commerce had the reviewers, who were excluding nonprofits run by white people due to perceived privilege, go through compulsory “anti-bias” training. They were each paid $500. Excluding nonprofits on the race of its leadership is certainly controversial. But some nonprofits receiving federal tax dollars hold radical left-wing political views. Is this where COVID relief tax dollars should go? Tax dollars for political advocacy Not all organizations to receive funding are controversial. You may wonder what the Seattle World Percussion Society would do with $25,000, but their organization doesn’t raise eyebrows. But other nonprofits receiving tax dollars are concerning. Collective Justice, part of the Public Defenders Association, is a partisan, social justice group. It actively lobbies light-on-crime policies and is now being propped up by federal tax dollars. The nonprofit is currently asking supporters to back a Democrat-sponsored bill forcing courts to ignore the juvenile crimes of adult defendants in sentencing. It received $25,000 in federal tax dollars through the state. Also receiving funds: the Council on Islamic American Relations of Washington (CAIR-WA). It frequently engages in partisan political activism and has fundraised locally for anti-Semitic congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN). The Anti-Defamation League calls out CAIR for it’s anti-Semitic leaders and their ties to Hamas and anti-Israel groups. According to internal documents, the reviewers apparently rejected the application, in part, because their budget is already high. It appears the rejection was overruled and they were given $50,000. Tax dollars to bail criminals out of jail The Bail Project Spokane received $50,000 from the fund. The nonprofit is part of the national group, which opposes cash bail. It has been responsible for paying the bail for criminals who commit high profile crimes after release. Documents from Commerce suggest this group received inadequate vetting. Based on the rationale explaining the funding, Bail Project Spokane was selected for it’s political cause, not for being impacted by COVID. The Bail Project was described as a “small startup program” by internal paperwork to justify the grant. But it is not a small startup. The Bail Project national organization had an operation budget of nearly $25 million in 2018 and $15 million in 2019, according to Charity Navigator. Bail Project Spokane docs don’t cite COVID need The Bail Project Spokane does not reveal how COVID impacted it’s work in any of the funding documents Commerce released to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH. COVID had to impact the nonprofit in order to receive funding. Indeed, Secretary Brown said the fund was established because “these nonprofits are fighting to survive because the donations and local resources they depend on have dried up.” Instead, the rationale behind offering the nonprofit tax dollars for COVID relief was tied specifically to agreement with the group’s political activism. “The Bail Project Spokane addresses inequities created by the cash bail system, which disproportionately impacts BIPOC communities in Spokane,” the rationale from Philanthropy NW, provided to them by the nominating organization, Empire Health Foundation says. “Many individuals in Spokane are held in jail, pretrial, due to a bond they cannot afford to pay which is commonly less than $500. While some individuals can afford to pay their bond, others are forced to sit in jail for weeks and months before their court dates due to inability to pay.” This may be a noble cause but nobility is not a pre-requisite for funding. The Bail Project Spokane did not return emails requesting clarification on how COVID impacted their organization. It’s unclear how they used the grant money. The Bail Project Spokane, like all nonprofits receiving funding, signed a letter of attestation. It declares, “I agree that my organization has been impacted, including financially, by the COVID-19 pandemic.” But in this case, it doesn’t explain how. That’s unlike Climate Justice Initiative, a environmentalist group that was granted $50,000 from the fund. In it’s application, it specifically noted that COVID led to cancelled contracts and fundraisers. Did federal dollars go to bailing out felons? Did federal tax dollars go to the Bail Project? It’s unclear if it was directly used for that purpose. Indirectly? Yes. It is the group’s mission to bail suspects out of jail. Any funding to help keep the group operating is funding to help bail suspects out of jail. The organization’s representative signed an attestation document. In it, it makes promises. I agree that my organization may be required to provide receipts or additional documentation for up to 6 years following the receipt of any grant funding. If any of the expenses paid with grant money are found ineligible according to Federal Treasury or application guidelines, Grantee agrees to reimburse Commerce the full amount of the grant award. But a spokesperson for Commerce tells the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH that “none of the organizations awarded grants are required to show receipts,” just that they sign the attestation letter. Why does this matter? The Bail Project has a track record of bailing out criminals who recommit. https://www.scribd.com/document/494510722/The-Bail-Project-Spokane-Attestation#download&from_embed Some controversies In Chicago, the Bail Project helped pay for the release of 34-year-old Christopher Stewart for an incident with an ex-girlfriend. Stewart allegedly shot a gun into the ground at her 6-year-old son’s birthday party before threatening to kill her. The Bail Project posted Stewart’s bail. The following month, he was charged for trying to burn her alive inside her apartment. The Chicago Tribune reports that “Police rescued her as she hung out of a kitchen window.” It was considerably more tragic in St. Louis. Hours after bailing out Samuel Lee Scott in a domestic assault case, he was accused of beating his wife to death. Local leaders with the Bail Project downplayed their role in releasing the accused murderer. “If he’d just been wealthy enough to afford his bail he would have been free in either case,” Mike Milton, site manager of the St. Louis Bail Project, told the St. Louis Post Dispatch. “Moments like this are devastating, but it’s important not to lose sight of the larger injustices of cash bail and the need for reform.” Washington isn’t alone with its pandering Most non-profits have been hit hard by COVID. They’re not fundraising like they used to, and not just because events have been cancelled. Our pandemic economy means less people have money to give. That the state is using federal tax dollars to reward non-profits on the basis of the racial makeup of its leadership or the community it serves is disturbing. But it matches the political pandering of the last several months from Democrat lawmakers. Citing equity goals, Democrats claim they’re fixing historical wrongs. They tend to leave out that those wrongs were established while their party was in power. Washington state, to be clear, isn’t alone in this woke grant-giving. The Oregon Cares Fund earmarked over $60 million to exclusively help black Oregonians and black-owned businesses. The funding also came from the CARES Act. It now faces discrimination lawsuits. In Denver, artists from marginalized communities were given priority to one-time grants funded by the CARES Act. A similar program was announced in Boston. Federal funds doled out COVID financial support as “a beginning effort to address the historical disparity in support for BIPOC communities and arts.” Is this a political slush fund for some groups? The Washington Equity Relief Fund seems as much about rewarding some nonprofits for their political activism, as it was about helping them cope with COVID interference. That they hand-picked “reviewers” to go over applications with an eye towards racial diversity, but not ideological diversity, is instructive. Their bias ensures that certain groups will get preferential treatment, even after their anti-bias training. But more importantly, tax dollars shouldn’t go to partisan political groups. The vetting doesn’t seem intense based on the Bail Project paperwork submitted. And that the groups promise they must submit receipts, but the WA DOC doesn’t actually require them, suggests there is little oversite. Who ensures our tax dollars staying away from the very activities it shouldn’t fund?"
Biden Admin Promises Rabid Gun Grabbers’ Agenda Will Be Carried Out,13 FEB 2021,5592,"The Biden administration, after breaking their $2000 ‘day one’ promise is apparently trying to calm the radical members of the left by promising a massive and radical rape of the Second Amendment. The Epoch Times reported: With control of the House, Senate, and White House as a backdrop, Biden administration officials in their meeting with gun control advocates conveyed confidence about enacting gun control legislation through legislative and executive actions that in the past had not gotten the votes. On Wednesday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public Engagement Director and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond held a virtual meeting with leaders of gun control groups, including Gifford’s Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, and Brady, during which they discussed gun violence in America. Rice and Richmond told attendees that [] Joe Biden and [] Kamala Harris are ready to act to reduce gun violence and enact “common sense” gun laws. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday that the Biden Administration is moving forward with fulfilling its “ambitious plan” of increasing gun control in the near future. “During the campaign, [] Biden laid out an ambitious plan to make our community safer. And that’s why in part, yesterday, senior members of his team … hosted a virtual discussion with leaders of gun violence prevention groups to discuss our shared goals,” said Psaki. “We look forward to working with gun violence survivors and advocates and sharing more in the weeks and months ahead about our efforts to make our communities safer,” she added. The main part of Biden’s gun control agenda includes banning the manufacture and sale of “assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines, regulating possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act, buying back these weapons and high-capacity magazines from citizens, requiring background checks for all gun sales, ending the online sale of firearms and ammunition, and providing more funds to enforce these laws. The gun control groups who were in attendance at Wednesday’s meeting shared their optimism about getting gun control laws in place that had previously been blocked by the GOP majority in the Senate. “This meeting provided more evidence that the Biden Administration is committed to being the strongest we’ve ever seen on gun safety,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a joint press release. Among the topics discussed at Wednesday’s meeting were steps that can be taken to close background check loopholes, stopping the sales of unregulated and untraceable “ghost” guns, and expanding violence intervention programs. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said she is confident that the public will see gun control executive and legislative action in the near future. “In 2013, after gun safety stalled in the Senate, President Biden stood by former Congresswoman Giffords and vowed to fight the gun lobby and that the time would come for change. That moment has arrived,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords.org, referring to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). Giffords is a gun control group founded by former Congresswoman Giffords, who was shot in the head by a gunman in 2011 at a “Congress On Your Corner” constituent event in Tucson, and where six people were killed and 12 were injured. In addition, Kris Brown, the president of Brady, praised the Biden Administration’s willingness to take “decisive action” against gun violence. “They know that this is a public health threat and that there isn’t a moment to waste. This administration is prepared to take a whole-of-government approach to keep Americans safe and Brady looks forward to working with them to do so,” said Brown in a Thursday press statement. The Brady organization was named after Jim Brady, former press secretary for Ronald Reagan who in 1981 became permanently disabled from a gunshot wound during the attempted assassination of the Republican president. Meanwhile, gun rights groups are encouraging members to demand that their state and federal lawmakers advocate for gun owners by protecting the Second Amendment. Colorado’s Rally for Your Rights members are gearing up to fight local and federal legislation that infringes on their Second Amendment rights to own a gun for self-defense. The National Rifle Association (NRA), has urged members “to make their voices heard in opposition to any infringement upon their constitutional rights.” The 117th U.S. Congress has filed a half dozen gun control measures with the House Judiciary Committee and includes Rep. Bobby Rush’s (D-Ill.) H.R.30, which would punish and deter firearms trafficking and Rep. Al Green’s (D-Texas) H.R.167, which would prohibit the transfer of a firearm at a gun show by a person who is not a federally licensed firearms dealer. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) has filed four gun control bills including H.R.127, which would require the licensing of firearm and ammunition possession and the registration of firearms and to prohibit the possession of certain ammunition. Gun rights groups have called H.R. 127 “The Gun Apocalypse” because the bill would require expensive psychological evaluations for multiple family members before being able to purchase a gun. “Biden wants to ban our semi-auto rifles, tax our guns/mags & more. He knows the only thing standing in his way to DISMANTLE THE 2ND AMENDMENT is NRA. Gun owners must stay vigilant & be engaged in elections and the legislative process,” The NRA told its members."
"FL Gov Blasts Biden For Unconstitutional ‘Travel’ Restrictions As NY Gov Killed Thousands, But Gets $50 Billion",12 FEB 2021,3354,"In Florida, people are free. Mask mandates have been scrapped and businesses are open. In New York, thousands more deaths are finally being admitted after draconian lockdowns and deliberate infection tactics that sent COVID patients to nursing homes. But what is the Biden administration doing? Threatening travel restrictions on Florida and giving New York $50 billion. Governor Ron DeSantis responded to the “unconstitutional” threats. The Epoch Times reported: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing back against a report about a potential CCP Virus related domestic travel restriction for Floridians, calling the idea “unconstitutional.” “And I think it’s an absurd report that they would be doing that. I think it would be unconstitutional, it would be unwise and it would be unjust,” DeSantis said at a press conference on Thursday. The Miami Herald reported Wednesday that the Biden administration is considering whether to impose domestic travel restrictions, including on Florida, to stem the spread of the UK variant. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) says it is monitoring the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7, which has recently surged in Florida and California, where over a third of all cases in the United States have been identified. Meanwhile, DeSantis said he is unclear why the Biden administration would target Florida for travel restriction given the pandemic is far worse in other states and the southern border permits illegal immigrants. “And if you think about it, restricting the right of Americans to travel freely throughout our country while allowing illegal aliens to pour across the southern border unmolested would be a ridiculous, but very damaging, farce,” he continued. DeSantis told reporters that he will oppose any travel restrictions, because Florida is doing better than many other states to contain the virus, with the death rates lower and the rate of vaccinations. “So we will oppose it 100 percent,” DeSantis said. “It would not be based in science. It would purely be a political attack against the people of Florida, and it’s unclear why they would even try talking about that.” After DeSantis’s press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed the idea of the reported domestic travel restrictions at her daily briefing on Thursday. “We are always considering what steps are necessary to keep the American people safe, but we are not currently in the process of… no decisions have been made around additional public health measures that would delay—or would change, I should say—domestic travel considerations,” Psaki said. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Wednesday wrote a letter to President Joe Biden amid the reports of travel restrictions. “Instituting a travel ban, or any restriction of movement between the states would be an outrageous, authoritarian move that has no basis in law or science.  Instead, it would only serve to inflict severe and devastating economic pain on an already damaged economy,” Rubio wrote. Rubio called any travel restriction between states draconian and urged Biden to instead help citizens get access to the vaccine. “Instead of dictating where Americans can, or cannot travel, your administration should instead focus on increasing supply and availability of vaccines, especially to Florida, the third most populous state and a winter retreat,” Rubio added."
"#Cuomocide: Cuomo Lied About Nursing Home Deaths, Thousands Killed",12 FEB 2021,11641,"Andrew Cuomo is under fire… finally… after a top aide ‘apologized’ for withholding the true death counts in New York nursing homes after deliberately sending infected patients there, instead of the Navy hospital ship. The New York Post reported: Governor Cuomo’s top aide privately apologized to Democratic lawmakers for withholding the state’s nursing-home death toll from COVID-19 — telling them “we froze” out of fear the true numbers would “be used against us” by federal prosecutors, The Post has learned. The stunning admission of a cover-up was made by Secretary to the Governor Melissa DeRosa during a video conference call with state Democratic leaders in which she said the Cuomo administration had rebuffed a legislative request for the tally in August because “right around the same time, [President Donald Trump] turns this into a giant political football,” according to an audio recording of the two-hour-plus meeting. “He starts tweeting that we killed everyone in nursing homes,” DeRosa said. “He starts going after [New Jersey Gov. Phil] Murphy, starts going after [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom, starts going after [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer.” In addition to attacking Cuomo’s fellow Democratic governors, DeRosa said, Trump “directs the Department of Justice to do an investigation into us.” “And basically, we froze,” she told the lawmakers on the call. “Because then we were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, what we start saying, was going to be used against us while we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation.” DeRosa added: “That played a very large role into this.” After dropping the bombshell, DeRosa asked for “a little bit of appreciation of the context” and offered what appears to be the Cuomo administration’s first apology for its handling of nursing homes amid the pandemic. But instead of a mea culpa to the grieving family members of more than 13,000 dead seniors or the critics who say the Health Department spread COVID-19 in the care facilities with a March 25 state Health Department directive that nursing homes admit infected patients, DeRosa tried to make amends with the fellow Democrats for the political inconvenience it caused them. “So we do apologize,” she said. “I do understand the position that you were put in. I know that it is not fair. It was not our intention to put you in that political position with the Republicans.” Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) immediately rejected DeRosa’s expression of remorse, according to the recording. “I don’t have enough time today to explain all the reasons why I don’t give that any credit at all,” said Gottfried, one of the lawmakers who demanded the death-toll data in August. State Senate Aging Committee Chairwoman Rachel May (D-Syracuse) — who was battered during her re-election bid last year over the issue of nursing-home deaths — also ripped into DeRosa, saying her former opponent had launched another broadside earlier in the day. “And the issue for me, the biggest issue of all is feeling like I needed to defend — or at least not attack — an administration that was appearing to be covering something up,” she said. “And in a, in a pandemic, when you want the public to trust the public-health officials, and there is this clear feeling that they’re not coming, being forthcoming with you, that is really hard and it remains difficult.” Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens), who took part in the call, told The Post on Thursday that DeRosa’s remarks sounded “like they admitted that they were trying to dodge having any incriminating evidence that might put the administration or the [Health Department] in further trouble with the Department of Justice.” “That’s how I understand their reasoning of why they were unable to share, in real time, the data,” Kim said. “They had to first make sure that the state was protected against federal investigation.” Kim, whose uncle is presumed to have died of COVID-19 in a nursing home in April, also said he wasn’t satisfied with DeRosa’s apology. “It’s not enough how contrite they are with us,” he said. “They need to show that to the public and the families — and they haven’t done that.” In addition to stonewalling lawmakers on the total number of nursing home residents killed by COVID-19, Cuomo’s administration also refused requests from the news media — including The Post — and fought a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed by the Empire Center on Public Policy. Instead, it only disclosed data on the numbers of residents who died in their nursing homes. But after Attorney General Letitia James last month released a damning report that estimated the deaths of nursing-home residents in hospitals would boost the grim tally by more than 50 percent, Health Commissioner Howard Zucker finally released figures showing the combined total was 12,743 as of Jan. 19. Just a day earlier, the DOH was only publicly acknowledging 8,711 deaths in nursing homes. In a Wednesday letter to lawmakers, Zucker said the total number of nursing home residents killed by COVID-19 had increased to 13,297 That number jumps to 15,049 when assisted living/adult care facilities are factored in. The controversy generated by James’ report led to an infamous news conference at which Cuomo callously dismissed the matter of where nursing home fatalities actually took place. “Who cares [if they] died in the hospital, died in a nursing home? They died,” he said. During Wednesday’s conference call, DeRosa said it appeared the DOJ was no longer focused on New York’s nursing home deaths. “All signs point to they are not looking at this, they’ve dropped it,” she said. … The DOJ declined to comment. Had to go back and check. This tweet was 9 months ago. https://t.co/OaAv7ArL9y — Jack Posobiec  (@JackPosobiec) February 12, 2021 How anyone still listens to this laughingstock is a mystery to me.  https://t.co/lhCF1t6JoN — Catturd ™ (@catturd2) February 12, 2021 On the heels of revelations that @NYGovCuomo lied about Covid-19 deaths Biden is sending him $50B while threatening @GovRonDeSantis with a travel ban because he won’t bend the knee to him. — @amuse (@amuse) February 12, 2021 This isn't some big mystery Cuomo didn't use the USNS Comfort or Javits Center because he didn't want Trump to get credit He sent 9,000 infected patients into the nursing homes instead — Jack Posobiec  (@JackPosobiec) February 12, 2021 The Epoch Times was more accurate in its report: The new disclosure, released on Feb. 10, was prompted by a FOIL application by the Empire Center, a think tank. “Those revelations increased the known death toll from about 9,000 to almost 15,000—making clear that the pandemic’s toll on long-term care residents was much worse than the Cuomo administration previously portrayed it to be,” the Empire Center said in a statement. The data shows that there were 6,344 confirmed and 2,981 presumed in-facility COVID-19 deaths and another 4,775 confirmed out-of-facility deaths. The COVID-19 death toll associated with New York long-term care facilities is higher, the Empire Center said, as the data does not include some 600 presumed out-of-facility COVID-19 deaths. It comes amid reports that, during a video conference call, Cuomo’s top aide allegedly apologized to state Democratic lawmakers for withholding the state’s COVID-19 nursing-home death toll, according to The New York Post. … New York GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy criticized the Cuomo administration’s reported admission of a cover-up. “The second most powerful person in state government and top aide to Governor Cuomo admitted on video to the premeditated and willful violation of state laws and what clearly amounts to federal obstruction of justice,” Langworthy said in a statement. “Andrew Cuomo has abused his power and destroyed the trust placed in the office of governor. Prosecution and impeachment discussions must begin right away.” Meanwhile, records obtained by The Associated Press show that 9,056 recovering COVID-19 patients in New York state were released from hospitals into nursing homes early in the pandemic under a controversial directive that was later scrapped amid criticism it accelerated outbreaks. The revelation raises new questions as to whether a March 25 directive from Cuomo’s administration helped spread sickness and death among residents, a charge the state disputes. “The lack of transparency and the meting out of bits of important data has undermined our ability to both recognize the scope and severity of what’s going on” and address it, said Richard Mollot, the executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a residents advocacy group, in remarks to The Associated Press. The COVID-related nursing home deaths have been a flashpoint for criticism against Cuomo, who faced public outcry over a controversial March 25 directive—subsequently reversed in May—essentially prohibiting nursing home operators from refusing to accept residents even if they tested positive for COVID-19. “No resident shall be denied readmission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19,” the order said. Under the order, if hospital staff determined residents were medically stable, nursing homes were prohibited from requiring that the patient be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission. Experts warned at the time that the order would lead to a surge in COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. Cuomo’s new order, issued in May, required hospitals to keep elderly COVID-19 patients until a negative test was confirmed or move them to another state-run facility that wasn’t a nursing home. Cuomo has repeatedly rejected links between the since-repealed policy and the thousands of nursing home deaths in the state. Last year, the Cuomo administration flatly denied the allegations. “Admission policies to nursing homes were not a significant factor in nursing home fatalities. And data suggests that nursing home quality is not a factor in mortality from COVID.” A state Department of Health study (pdf) corroborated this stance, concluding that it was infected nursing home staff that fanned the spread. “This study highlighted a critically important fact that the overwhelming majority of hospital patients sent back into nursing homes were not only medically stable, they were no longer contagious, and that 81 percent of the nursing homes receiving COVID patients from New York’s hospitals already had the virus,” said Michael Dowling, CEO of Northwell Health, in a release. New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said at a press conference following the release of a report that admission policies were not a significant factor in virus-related nursing home deaths, and called attempts to blame the fatalities on the March 25 executive order a “false narrative.” However, questions have been raised about the reliability and impartiality of the study, and a number of lawmakers have called for a probe. Meanwhile, Harvard University health care policy professor David Grabowski told NBC New York in an interview in August of last year that he believes the March 25 directive fanned the flames of the outbreak in nursing homes but was probably not the main factor. “Did the policy increase fatalities in the state?” Grabowski said of the executive order. “It probably did. I just don’t think it was the primary driver.”  My Statement on the bombshell @nypost reporting on Cuomo’s cover-up  pic.twitter.com/brOrGZjeBo — Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) February 12, 2021"
Vaccine Deaths Increase As Media Pushes For “Vaccine Passport” By Summer,12 FEB 2021,19489,"The COVID vaccine is killing people left and right, but that information is being suppressed by the media, who in turn are clamoring for a vaccine “passport” being required for travel in the United States by this summer. And apparently, this has been the goal for more than two years… death by vaccine? National File reported: As the United States prepares to open back up after the unnecessarily long COVID lockdowns, the mainstream media is shaping the narrative that “vaccination passports” will not only be required for travel, but that they will arrive as a necessity by this summer. CBS News travel editor, Peter Greenberg, almost appeared gleeful when he predicted two things: that travel – both domestic and international – would most likely return this summer, and that there would be a prerequisite to being able to travel. Greenberg stated bluntly that in order to travel you will most likely need proof that you’ve been vaccinated for COVID. Vaccination passports, he said, will be the new standard in travel. “It will be required,” Greenberg said. “The real question is what technology will be available to create a universally acceptable and universally readable document that can’t be forged.” A new term has entered the vocabulary among governments and in the travel industry: vaccine passport. In the near future, travel may require proof that passengers have been vaccinated or tested negative for the coronavirus. https://t.co/imfNDCvWAU — The New York Times (@nytimes) February 4, 2021 He noted that preliminary versions of a vaccine passport – or health passport – are being developed by several outlets, in both the public and private sectors – and in some cases a combination of both, around the world. Greenberg spotlighted the effort taking place in Denmark, pointing out that the Nordic nation is creating a digital passport for citizens that will contain all your current medical information that can be updatable on that digital card.” The CBS News reporter, speaking with a level of authority usually reserved for higher-level medical professionals intimate with the COVID pandemic, said while digital versions of “your papers” appear to be the goal, early models will likely be physical. One entrepreneur has come up with two versions of a vaccination passport, one for international travel and another for domestic. The international version has e-vaccine technology that is tantamount to an electronic version of your health records. His domestic – or basic version (without the e-vaccine technology), he suggests, would be more appropriate for domestic travel and daily interactions.  Both versions hold information about which vaccine was administered, where it was administered, and when. The Times reports that airlines, nonprofits, industry groups and tech companies are all working on launching an app or digital proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test. https://t.co/L9xgwPdApV — KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO (@KNX1070) February 4, 2021 Greenberg told local reporters that vaccine verification would most likely become commonplace for cruise lines and some airlines as soon as July. “They’re gonna be asking for it at your point of departure and your point of entry,” Greenberg said. He continued on saying additional places where you might be asked to “show your papers” include airline ticket counters, passport control lanes, and Customs and Border Protection embarkation points. Lost in the madness to rush to vaccine documentation requirements are existing HIPPA laws and the very issue of privacy. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) created a national standard for protecting sensitive patient information. Included in the Protected Health Information (PHI) are not only your name, social security number, address(es), phone number(s), test results, and diagnoses, but also personal and behavioral attributes that can help anyone – including travel industry companies – single out an individual. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution’s Bill of Rights protects against illegal search and seizure, stating clearly: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” Curiously, there have been no privacy advocate groups stepping up to challenge the encroachment into the privacy of Americans where the questionable subject of vaccine documentation is concerned. Meanwhile, the Epoch Times reported on the growing number of vaccine deaths: In Kentucky, four seniors died the same day of their vaccination on Dec. 30, 2020. Three of the four who passed away reportedly already had had coronavirus prior to getting vaccinated. In Arkansas, four seniors died at a long term care facility about a week after their vaccination. All tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination. The deaths are reported in a federal database called VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Deaths after vaccination don’t necessarily mean the vaccine is to blame. Of those receiving coronavirus vaccines, many are elderly and frail, or already suffering from serious illnesses. That makes it difficult to know whether there’s a connection. Kentucky Nursing Home Deaths According to VAERS reports, the Kentucky deaths occurred on Dec. 30 after vaccinations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. An ill 88-year-old woman who was “14 + days post covid” was given the Pfizer-BioNTech shot while she was “unresponsive in [her] room.” She died within an hour and a half (914961-1). An 88-year-old who was “15 days post covid” got the shot, was monitored for 15 minutes afterward, and passed away within 90 minutes (914994-1). A third report says an 88-year-old woman who was “14 + days post covid” vomited four minutes after receiving her shot, became short of breath, and passed away that night (915562-1). And an 85-year-old woman vaccinated at 5 p.m. was “found unresponsive” less than two hours later and died shortly after (915682-1). In response to questions about the Kentucky cluster, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said its experts noted “no pattern … among the [Kentucky] cases that would indicate a concern for the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine.” Scientists differ on whether people who have had coronavirus, like the Kentucky patients, should receive the COVID-19 vaccination at all. The CDC insists it’s safe for people who have recovered from COVID-19 to get vaccinated and that there’s no minimum interval recommended between infection and vaccination. “Vaccination should be offered to persons regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] infection,” it states. But other scientists say vaccinating people who are already considered immune after a natural COVID-19 infection wastes valuable doses of vaccines when there are shortages. And neither Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s studies showed any benefit to vaccinating previously infected patients. The Kentucky patients were vaccinated shortly after the CDC disseminated false information on this point. The CDC claimed studies showed that vaccines are effective for people who have had COVID-19. The disinformation was given on the agency’s website, in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and in a webinar instruction to medical professionals. In the webinar, the CDC’s Dr. Sarah Oliver falsely stated, “Data from both clinical trials suggests that people with prior infection are still likely to benefit from vaccination.” Under pressure from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who first flagged the CDC’s incorrect information in December, the agency recently issued a correction but used wording that still falsely implies studies showed that the vaccines helped people previously infected with COVID-19. Meantime, preliminary results from a study co-authored by a team of more than two dozen researchers noted that people infected with COVID-19 in the past “experience systemic side effects with a significantly higher frequency” after vaccination than others. The CDC confirms that it’s monitoring reports that people who’ve already had COVID-19 seem to be suffering significantly more frequent or more severe reactions after vaccination, or “reactogenicity,” than those who didn’t have COVID-19. “CDC is aware of reports of increased reactogenicity (such as fever, chills, and muscle aches) in persons who have had COVID-19,” said a spokesman. Arkansas Nursing Home Deaths Four nursing home deaths in Arkansas occurred after vaccination with the Moderna-manufactured vaccine. All four patients tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination, according to the VAERS reports. But there’s no indication as to whether they had coronavirus at the time of their vaccination or acquired it after their shot. A 65-year-old man (921547-1) who received the Moderna vaccine on Jan. 2, 2021, died two days later, with the VAERS report noting that he had COVID-19. Three other Arkansas seniors died about a week after receiving the Moderna vaccine on Dec. 22, 2020. The person reporting the death of an 82-year-old man (917117-1) six days after his shot said he was vaccinated in an attempt to “mitigate his risk” and that “this was unsuccessful and [the] patient died.” The VAERS report notes, “After vaccination, patient tested positive for COVID-19.” Two elderly women, ages 90 (917790-1) and 78 (917793-1), were vaccinated the same day as the 65-year-old man and also tested positive for COVID-19 about a week after their shots and died. According to the unnamed person who reported the 90-year-old’s death, “the vaccine did not have enough time to prevent COVID 19” and “There is no evidence that the vaccination caused patient’s death. It simply didn’t have time to save her life.” The person who reported the 78-year-old’s death claimed she died “as a result of COVID-19 and her underlying health conditions and not as a result of the vaccine.” In response to questions about the Arkansas cluster, the CDC said, “Surveillance data to date do not indicate excess deaths among elderly patients receiving COVID-19 vaccinations.” Overall, says the agency, the number of deaths at long term care facilities after COVID-19 vaccinations is no higher than what would be expected to occur naturally. Frail Patients Separately, the CDC is monitoring the impact of the vaccines on already-frail patients such as the chronically ill in nursing homes. In Norway, alarm bells sounded when 23 people died shortly after vaccination. After investigating 13 of the deaths, Norway’s medical agency has concluded side effects that are common with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, such as fever, nausea, and diarrhea, “may have contributed to fatal outcomes in some of the frail patients.” “There is a possibility that these common adverse reactions, that are not dangerous in fitter, younger patients and are not unusual with vaccines, may aggravate underlying disease in the elderly,” said Steinar Madsen, medical director of the Norwegian Medicines Agency. [“possibility”] A World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel disagrees. It says the deaths “are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events.” But one unanswered question is whether patients who are both frail and have already had COVID-19 might suffer a double-whammy that puts them at greater risk when vaccinated. First, those with a previous COVID-19 infection might be more likely to suffer adverse events upon vaccination, according to scientific reports. Second, their frailty may make them less able to handle the adverse events, as Norway’s medical agency found with some patients. In the United States, VAERS reports contain numerous other cases of elderly, frail people who’d had COVID-19, got vaccinated, and died. A 96-year-old Ohio woman tested positive for COVID-19 in November, got the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 28, 2020, in a rehab facility after a fall, and died that afternoon (915920-1). A 94-year-old Michigan man at a senior living facility who had COVID-19 and other illnesses received the Moderna vaccine on Jan. 2, 2021, and died of cardiac arrest two days later (918487-1). A 91-year-old Michigan woman with Alzheimer’s and other illnesses at a senior living facility who had tested positive for COVID-19 received the Moderna vaccine on Dec. 30, 2020. She died four days later (924186-1). And an 85-year-old California woman with Alzheimer’s and other disorders at a senior living facility received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on Jan. 5, 2021, and was found dead the same day. After her vaccination, an earlier COVID-19 test from Jan. 3 returned positive, though she’d had no symptoms (924456-1). In other cases, elderly, frail patients tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after vaccination. A 104-year-old woman in New York received the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 30, 2020. The next day, a COVID-19 test was done and came back positive. She became ill the following day and died on Jan. 4, 2021 (920832-1). And a 71-year-old New York man received the Moderna vaccine on Dec. 21, 2020, developed a fever and respiratory distress, and tested positive for COVID-19. He was given Remdesivir. He died after 6 days (922977-1). A WHO vaccine safety subcommittee reviewed reports of deaths among the frail, elderly after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The members determined, two weeks ago, there’s no cause for concern. “The benefit-risk balance of [Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine] BNT162b2 remains favorable in the elderly, and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of this vaccine,” said the WHO officials. Pfizer, Moderna, and CDC Responses In response to questions for this report, Pfizer issued a statement saying: “We take adverse events that are potentially associated with our COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, very seriously. We closely monitor all such events and collect relevant information to share with global regulatory authorities. Based on ongoing safety reviews performed by Pfizer, BioNTech and health authorities, BNT162b2 retains a positive benefit-risk profile for the prevention of COVID-19 infections.” Pfizer said that millions of people have been vaccinated and “serious adverse events, including deaths that are unrelated to the vaccine, are unfortunately likely to occur at a similar rate as they would in the general population.” Pfizer didn’t answer whether it has concluded that any deaths might be linked to vaccination. It also wouldn’t answer whether it has looked at any clusters of deaths, or noted any patterns or areas of concern. And the company wouldn’t say whether it recommends that those recently or currently infected with COVID-19 get vaccinated. Moderna didn’t answer our questions or request for information and comment. Currently, the CDC recommends vaccination for people who’ve already had coronavirus. The agency didn’t directly answer the question of whether it’s safe for people to get vaccinated while they have an active COVID-19 infection. A CDC spokesman said that deferring vaccination is recommended in those instances, but didn’t say whether it was due to a safety issue. “Vaccination of persons with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred until the person has recovered from the acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and criteria have been met for them to discontinue isolation,” says the CDC. “This recommendation applies to persons who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection before receiving any vaccine doses as well as those who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection after the first dose but before receipt of the second dose.” PRN News Wire explained: The primary mechanism for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S., the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), reported 181 deaths — a subset of 7,844 total adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination — as of January 15, 2021. The VAERS reports describe outcomes ranging from “foaming at the mouth” to “massive heart attacks.” According to Reuters, 10,595,866 individuals have received one or more COVID-19 vaccines as of January 15. Miami obstetrician Dr. Gregory Michael suffered from a hemorrhagic stroke after receiving Pfizer/BioNtech’s COVID vaccine. He died two weeks later. Pfizer stated that it didn’t think there was any direct connection to the vaccine. The New York Times quoted Dr. Jerry Spivak, a blood disorder expert at Johns Hopkins University, saying “I think it’s a medical certainty that the vaccine was related.” Data about deaths following receipt of the experimental Pfizer/BioNTech shot are also emerging from Israel, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland. Norway launched an investigation into the vaccines after reports of 33 suspected adverse drug reactions with fatal outcomes after administration of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine were received by the Norwegian Medicines Agency.  Pharma and Federal agencies are attributing the majority of these cases to “coincidence.” “Coincidence is turning out to be quite lethal to COVID vaccine recipients,” said Children’s Health Defense (CHD) board chairman Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “If the clinical trials are good predictors, the rate of coincidence is likely to increase dramatically after the second shot.” The clinical trials suggested that almost all the benefits of COVID vaccination and the vast majority of injuries were associated with the second dose. While the VAERS database numbers are sobering, according to an U.S. Health and Human Services study, the actual number of adverse events is likely significantly higher. VAERS is a passive surveillance system that relies on the willingness of individuals and professionals to submit reports voluntarily. In December, CHD and Kennedy wrote to former FDA Director, David  Kessler, MD who currently serves as co-chair of the COVID-19 Advisory Board and President Biden’s version of Operation Warp Speed, that VAERS has been an abject failure, with fewer than 1% of adverse events ever reported according to a 2010 federal study. A critic familiar with VAERS’ shortcomings bluntly condemns VAERS in the British Medical Journal as “nothing more than window dressing, and a part of US authorities’ systematic effort to reassure/deceive us about vaccine safety.” Last week, California health officials temporarily paused a large batch of Moderna vaccines due to a high number of allergic reactions, but reversed that decision a few days later. Anyone suffering from a serious injury will have little legal recourse because they will be directed to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program which has rejected 90% of vaccine-injury claims over the past decade. CHD calls for complete transparency, asking Dr. Kessler and the federal government to release ALL of the data from the clinical trials and suspend COVID-19 vaccine use in any group not adequately represented in the clinical trials, i.e. elderly, frail, comorbid conditions, etc. CHD also asks for full transparency in post-marketing data that reports all health outcomes (including new diagnoses of autoimmune disorders), adverse events and deaths from COVID-19 vaccine."

Congress Plans To Destroy Republic: ‘Election Reform’ Bill HR1 Would Ensure No ‘Primaries’ Ever Again,11 FEB 2021,7269,"Congress is afraid. With an approval rating just slighter higher than chopped liver, the elitist controllers who lie to the American people daily are planning to make sure they’re never elected out of office again. The first priority for Congress (both House and Senate) is ‘election reform’ measures that would essentially ensure that all elections could be rigged forever. The Gatestone Institute explained: H.R.1 packs into one 791-page bill every bad idea about how to run elections and mandates that the states must adopt — the very things that made the election of 2020 such a mess. It includes all of the greatest hits of 2020: Mandatory mail ballots, ballots without postmarks, late ballots and voting in precincts where you don’t live. It includes so many bad ideas that no publication has satisfactory space to cover all of them. The Senate companion bill, S.1, might be even worse. These bills rearrange the relationship between the states and the federal government. The Constitution presumes that states regulate their own elections, but the Constitution has a big “but” in what is called the Elections Clause. The Constitution says, “but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.” For over 200 years, Congress rarely used this power. After all, the power was put in the Constitution only to prevent the states from suffocating the federal government out of existence by never holding federal elections. Do not assume that the bills will stall and wither in the process. They are named H.R.1 and S.1 for a reason. The bills are the top priority of the newly empowered Democrats in Congress. Dissatisfied with the effectiveness of the last federal mandate — 1993’s Motor Voter law — H.R.1 dispenses with the idea that an American should go affirmatively register to vote. In 2020, states such as Nevada and New Jersey sent ballots through the mail to anyone on their registration lists despite having voter rolls full of errors. The Public Interest Legal Foundation documented thousands of ineligible registrations in Nevada alone that received mail ballots. Some were sent to vacant lots, abandoned mines, casinos and even liquor stores. States also would be blocked by H.R.1 from signature verification procedures. H.R.1 rigs the system for any lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the law. All lawsuits can only be filed in one court – federal court in the District of Columbia. And all opposition must be consolidated into one brief with only one attorney being able to argue the merits. It also grants automatic intervention to any legislators who want to join in the fight against the lone opposition. It prohibits states from conducting list maintenance on the voter rolls. That means deadwood and obsolete registrations will stack up. HR.1 and S.1 are omnibus bills that would change every American citizen’s — and foreigner’s — relationship to voter registration. Universal automatic voter registration has, for years, been a top priority of the institutional left. In fact, H.R.1 would do away with actual voter registration and instead make the voter rolls merely a copy of anyone already on a government list — such as welfare recipients and other social service beneficiaries. The bills would expand well beyond to federal entities like the Social Security Administration, Department of Defense, Customs and Immigration, and elements of Health and Human Services. Naturally, a giant federal database would serve as the home for this list of people who must be automatically registered to vote, whether they know it or not. Imagine the number of government databases in which your information is contained. Do your names and addresses all match? Does Social Security know you moved out of your birth state? Are your married and maiden names different? Did you get a driver’s license before obtaining American citizenship? You can see the pitfalls. One person will be “registered” to vote multiple times, with slight variation in names, and perhaps greater variation in residence addresses. Making it “easier” to get registered to vote through automatic registration from government lists might seem attractive, until you consider the disaster of universal auto-mail voting as we saw in 2020. H.R.1 and S.1 will force states to push ballots into the mail. It builds slack into the election system. Decentralized mail elections introduce error because of error-filled rolls. Mail-in ballots delay results, create uncertainty and push the elections into kitchens and bedrooms where election officials cannot observe the voting process and cannot protect the voter from coercion. H.R.1 takes the absolute worst emergency rule changes of 2020 and enshrines them as federal law. Gone also are state witness and notary requirements during the mail ballot application process. Nor may states enact identification requirements of “any form” for those requesting a ballot. That means no more voter ID as a matter of federal law. States also would be blocked by H.R.1 from signature verification procedures. It gets worse. The 791-page bill also includes: That is not all. Nationwide, states must accept mail ballots on Election Day plus 10 days later. States are allowed to add extra time to the window. No more election day. It will be election season, with a month of early voting and weeks of ballots arriving and being counted. And of course, unlimited ballot harvesting — having a third party “help” to fill in and gather up ballots, then drop them off at a polling station or other designated station — is guaranteed. Misinformation, protests, unrest, and even violence were all symptoms of the trauma of 2020. Activist groups and collusive officials in 2020 turned courts into weapons to transform state laws into election procedures that were favorable to one particular party. H.R.1 would finish the job, and federalize the policies and election procedures that made 2020 such a mess. It is no solution to presume that federal rules, even if they were crafted the right way, would solve the problem. When Washington D.C. gets control over elections, the policy always skews in one direction. I worked at the Justice Department, where career staff ignored federal laws they didn’t like, and only enforced the ones they thought would help advance their political beliefs. Motor Voter, for example, had a federal mandate that states clean voter rolls. Guess what happened after that rule passed in 1993? No private enforcement actions were brought for two decades until I brought one against Indiana. There is a federal mandate, passed in the 19th Century, to have one single election day. The bureaucrats in Washington in charge of enforcing that law ignore that law. Federal mandates are a one-way political ratchet. They always and only help one political party. The nation has seen this line of thinking before. Like Obamacare earlier, H.R.1 transitions our federalist Republic to some other brave new system that purports to right generations of structural wrongs, while at the same time entrenching other wrongs. Unifying American experiences such as coming together to vote on one single Election Day, governed by rules passed by state legislators, well, to the authors of H.R.1, that is just old fashioned."
North Dakota Lawmakers Working To Nullify Biden’s Unconstitutional ‘Orders’,10 FEB 2021,3113,"In North Dakota, lawmakers are doing what they’re supposed to do… represent the citizens of the state. They’re working to constitutionally nullify the unconstitutional orders being meted out by fraudulently installed Joe Biden. The National File reported: A new bill introduced in the North Dakota State Legislature (HB1164), would instruct the state’s Attorney General to review the constitutionality of each of the executive orders issued by Joe Biden. Under the proposed law, should the North Dakota Attorney General find that any executive orders are unlawful – or unconstitutional, the executive order would be “nullified,” it would prohibit any state, county, or local agency – or publicly funded organization – from enforcing the order(s). This is the way. @TenthAmendmenthttps://t.co/PekQfWpHXQ — Libertarian Party of Connecticut (@LibertarianCT) January 29, 2021 The proposed legislation was introduced by State Rep. Tom Kading (R), and eight other Republicans in the North Dakota House. Specifically, the proposed HB1164, enumerates the following issues for nullification: Additionally, State Rep. Sebastian Ertelt (R), has introduced legislation that would affect the same fate to unconstitutional legislation coming out of the Federal Legislative Branch. Ertelt’s HB1282 would create a “Committee on Neutralization of Federal Laws.” This committee, comprised of state legislative leadership and their appointees, would recommend whether a given Federal law or regulation is unconstitutional. Should the committee find that a law or regulation is unconstitutional, the North Dakota Legislature would pass a concurrent resolution on whether to nullify the transgressing law or edict. After the committee’s recommendation – and until the resolution is passed, state, county, and local agencies would be prohibited from enforcing the law or regulation. These proposed laws are in a good position to be codified. North Dakota Republicans control the Senate 40 to 7, and the House 80 to14. South Dakota bill seeks power to reject presidential executive orders https://t.co/krkDMXAJSP — Samantha Sullivan (@SamSullivan) February 1, 2021 South Dakota has legislation similar North Dakota’s HB1164 targeting Biden’s executive lawmaking. South Dakota’s HB1194 sets up an executive board to review the constitutionality of all presidential executive orders. It lists the six issues laid out in the North Dakota legislation as well. The South Dakota Legislature – as with the North Dakota Legislature – is dominated by Republicans; 32 to 3 in the Senate, and  62 to 8 in the House. The United States Constitution’s Supremacy Clause enjoins each state to follow laws that are constitutionally sound and only on issues that the Constitution granted purview to the federal government to determine. If the federal government – be it the Executive, Legislative, or the Judicial Branch – acts unconstitutionally, the individual states have a right to ignore the transgressing edict. This notion was championed by none other than the great champion of strong central government, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 33."
COVID 21? Experts Explain That COVID Vaccine Will Begin Depopulation In 6 Months,9 FEB 2021,12214,"According to some experts, the COVID vaccine is a depopulation tool that will begin causing fatalities within the next 6 months. The deaths will be claimed on “COVID 21.” Corona News wrote: Prof. Dolores Cahill received her PhD in Immunology from Dublin City University in 1994. She was group leader of the Protein Technology Group in the Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Genetics, Berlin, and is Professor of Translational Science at the UCD School of Medicine and Medical Sciences. COVID19 is a 99.4% to 99.8% survival rate virus, the death toll for which a team of researchers in one state found may be inflated by as much as 40%.   Video: Professor Dolores Cahill: Why People Will Start Dying A Few Months After The First Mrna Vaccination Will be Blamed on COVID Prof. Cahill says, importantly, that not only will recipients of vaccines start dying in great numbers, but that instead of being taken as a sign for caution, the deaths will be blamed on new and different types of coronaviruses, feeding into a deliberate program to create panic and hysteria. Many doctors and scientists have warned against taking the experimental vaccines.  (Also See: “The Coming Genocide of Adverse COVID Vax Reactions, and Who to Blame for It”) Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, a Senior Research Scientist at the University of Pittsburgh, writes in a science paper on previous efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines: “In SARS, a type of “priming” of the immune system was observed during animal studies of SARS spike protein-based vaccines leading to increased morbidity and mortality in vaccinated animals who were subsequently exposed to wild SARS virus. The problem, highlighted in two studies, became obvious following post-vaccination challenge with the SARS virus…” As explained by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of Children’s Health Defense: “Scientists first attempted to develop coronavirus vaccines after China’s 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals suffered hyper-immune responses including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same “enhanced immune response” during human testing of the failed RSV vaccine tests in the 1960s. Two children died.” An audit of death certificates shows that COVID death numbers are being inflated, possibly to induce people to take the vaccines. In an audit of nearly 3,000 death certificates, a team in Minnesota led by a medical doctor found that 40% of deaths being labeled as COVID were not COVID, but from other primary causes as diverse as flu, heart attacks, car accidents, a drowning, and gunshot wounds. (See: “Death Certificate Audit Shows COVID Deaths Inflated by Possible 40%, Calls for National Audit.“) The CDC reports that so far that COVID vaccinations have so far caused over 3,150 reactions which have rendered people “unable to work,”  or perform “daily activities”. In a recent count, 181 people have died soon after taking the experimental drugs, according to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS.) The doctors and scientists’ warning have fallen on deaf ears in the US government, as Joe Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci calls for “100 million” vaccinations in the US in a few months. Comparisons to Spanish Flu Neglect Population Difference COVID is now being compared to the Spanish Flu, because the US reported death toll is allegedly 400,000, but this neglects that the Spanish Flu was nearly a magnitude worse in per capita terms, as the population of the US was about 100,000 million at the time, less than one-third of today, and the death toll was nearly 700,000. Better comparisons are the 1957 Asian Flu and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu, the latter of which, in that same summer, the country had the largest mass gathering in US history, Woodstock.   Bill Gates Critic Ron Paul Shut-Down from Facebook After “Great Reset” Article Ron Paul, who recently wrote an essay warning of an end-game for the coronavirus outbreak which is for human control purposes, has been banned from communicating with his millions of Facebook followers. The mild-mannered former congressman, presidential candidate, and family physician has been a perpetual thorn in the side of big Wall Street banks, and oligarchs such as Bill Gates. As one digs in for a reason, a number of interesting recent posts from Dr. Paul emerge. In a message on Twitter Dr. Paul wrote: “With no explanation other than “repeatedly going against our community standards,”  @Facebook has blocked me from managing my page. Never have we received notice of violating community standards in the past and nowhere is the offending post identified.” Dr. Paul joins another former high government official, Catherine Austin Fitts, in detailing a plan to use mandatory vaccinations as a gateway into people’s bodies for the purpose of connecting them to artificial intelligence control and surveillance platforms.  Fitts was Assistant Secretary of Housing and Human Development under President George HW Bush, With no explanation other than “repeatedly going against our community standards,” @Facebook has blocked me from managing my page. Never have we received notice of violating community standards in the past and nowhere is the offending post identified. pic.twitter.com/EdMyW9gufa — Ron Paul (@RonPaul) January 11, 2021 Dr. Paul wrote on January 4th in “Oppression… The ‘Great Reset’ is about Expanding Government Power and Suppressing Liberty,” “World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab has proposed using the overreaction to coronavirus to launch a worldwide “Great Reset.” This Great Reset is about expanding government power and suppressing liberty worldwide…The Great Reset will dramatically expand the surveillance state via real-time tracking. It will also mandate that people receive digital certificates in order to travel and even technology implanted in their bodies to monitor them.” Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum , a gathering of the world’s most powerful people which meets in Davos, Switzerland to discuss future trends and initiatives, is the mastermind of the “Great Reset” which is presented as a response to environmental crisis.  However, in his July 2020 book “COVID-19: The Great Reset,” Schwab readily admits that COVID is a “mild” disease which nevertheless serves the purpose of instituting undreamed of controls over humanity.   Schwab writes that Covid-19 is: “one of the least deadly pandemics the world has experienced over the last 2000 years…the consequences of COVID-19 in terms of health and mortality will be mild compared to previous pandemics” Dr. Paul said in his article: “The Great Reset involves a huge expansion of the welfare state via a universal basic income program. This can help ensure compliance with the Great Reset’s authoritarian measures….We are told the lockdowns are ordered because of a virus that poses no great danger to a very large percentage of the American public. Yet, instead of adopting a different approach, politicians are doubling down on the failed policies of masks and lockdowns. Meanwhile, big tech companies, which are already often acting as partners of government, silence anyone who questions the official line regarding the threat of coronavirus or the effectiveness of lockdowns, masks, and vaccines.” Bill Gates Fingerprints on all Aspects of COVID and New Control Technologies As far back as April, Dr. Paul pointed out that Gates, a private citizen who nevertheless is one of the world’s richest men, has been the driving force behind worldwide forced vaccination programs for a decade.  Gates says that “proof” of vaccination will be needed to allow life to go on as normal for individuals, saying in one of a relentless campaign of interviews since the COVID outbreak last Spring: “eventually there will be sort of this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global re-opening up.” In one of Dr. Paul’s widely-viewed, regular online broadcasts his show pointed out that Gates was a key financial backer of a tattoo-like digital identification record which could store vast amounts of data on each person under the skin, readable by a scanner. ScienceAlert.com wrote in 2019: “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded the team’s research, which was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday. According to a Scientific American story, the project came about following a direct request from Microsoft founder Bill Gates himself, who has been personally involved in efforts to eradicate polio and measles through vaccinations.” Below: Dr. Paul Paul Show on Bill Gates Bill Gates: ‘Overpopulation,’ and Possibly Microchipping People (or Worse!)

Last April Fauci was the subject of a Newsweek expose’: “Dr. Fauci Backed Controversial Wuhan Lab with U.S. Dollars for Risky Coronavirus Research.”    Recently Fauci and others have been reciting that if only everyone in the nation wore masks consistently, 130,000 lives could be saved.   The study which makes this conclusion comes out of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which is also heavily funded by Bill Gates. Masks severely hamper interpersonal connection and exchange of emotion, and reinforce a crisis atmosphere.  It is difficult for people to connect, and perhaps organize a resistance, under mask and social distance rules. Bill Gates also gave nearly $8 million to Imperial College Professor Neil Ferguson, author of the now discredited report which forecast over 2 million dead in 2020 in the US if it did not lock down and implement mask laws.   The report is entitled “Report 9 – Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand.” in Belgium, a lawsuit is underway which names both Gates and Ferguson as defendants in a scheme to defraud the public by the criminal exploitation of the COVID crisis. Despite a carefully crafted image that Gates is a late-life billionaire who is now giving away his fortune, Gates’ net worth has been steadily climbing as his giving has increased. In India, a committee of investigation found that thousands of girls, whose families were illiterate, were maimed by vaccine trials funded by Gates of Gardasil, an anti-HPV vaccine made by Merck, in which Gates had investments. The credible India Economic Times reports: “The committee found that…In many other cases, thumbprint impressions of their poor and illiterate parents were duly affixed onto the consent form. The children also had no idea about the nature of the disease or the vaccine.” This is potentially in violation of principles established at the Nuremberg Trials, following the trial of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, that no experiments could be conducted on a person without their fully informed consent. Gates could be prosecuted on these ground alone, by any duly sworn prosecutor in any nation that is signatory to the Geneva Conventions. Dr. Paul’s Views Dovetail with HW Bush Administration Official Catherine Austin Fitts.  Fitts Lays Out The Great Reset and How to Stop It  Catherine Austin Fitts is an investment banker and former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George HW Bush.   Secretary Fitts describes how the push for a mandatory universal vaccination program is a gateway to global enslavement of most of humanity.

Media Is Lying: Trump Won Two Thirds Of Election Fraud Cases Where ‘Merit’ Considered,8 FEB 2021,3779,"The media loves to lie and claim that there is no evidence of election theft because the courts ‘found nothing.’ That is not true. The Epoch Times explained: The claim often repeated by the mainstream media, social-media content moderators, and fact-checkers that lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign and Republicans were universally dismissed by the courts is untrue, according to a new analysis. The findings do not necessarily suggest that if the lawsuits had all been decided before Joe Biden was certified as the official winner of the presidential election by Congress on Jan. 7 that former President Trump would have won the hotly contested election. Nor would they necessarily have affected many of the Electoral College votes won by Biden in the disputed battleground states. Some of the legal victories took place in states like Colorado and Iowa where the popular vote counts for the respective winners of those states –Biden in Colorado and Trump in Iowa— were not close. Of the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15, according to citizen journalist John Droz Jr., a physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C. This means Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts. Droz and a team of volunteers dug through court filings and legal minutiae to track down 81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election. The lawsuits were tracked on Droz’s publicly available spreadsheet that was current as of Feb. 6. Of the 81 cases, 11 were withdrawn or consolidated and 23 were dismissed for lack of standing or on other grounds. Both the cohort of 11 and of 23 should not be considered “wins or losses for either side,” Droz says, because they “have nothing to do with the merits of the case.” This leaves 47 cases. Of those 47, 22 have been finalized after the court heard arguments, considered evidence, and then issued a ruling. Of those 22, Trump or Republicans won 15 and lost 7, according to the analysis. This leaves 25 lawsuits that have yet to be finally disposed of. This means Trump and Republicans “have WON the majority of 2020 election cases fully heard, and then decided on the merits!” Droz said in a statement. “Is that what the mainstream media is reporting?” Among the legal victories for Republicans were: RNC v. Miller, in the Iowa courts, a lawsuit in which the Republican National Committee won an injunction over absentee ballot applications. RNC v. Gill, in the Iowa courts, in which the Trump campaign won an injunction preventing a county official from distributing and accepting signed forms containing preprinted information. Trump for President v. Boockvar, in the Pennsylvania courts, in which the Trump campaign was granted an injunction against the counting of mail-in and absentee ballots where voters were allowed to provide proof of identity days after Election Day. Droz noted that only three lawsuits addressed voting machine inaccuracies. “One of these was dismissed (due to jurisdiction), one was ruled against (although no discovery was granted), and one is still open (discovery was granted).” “The likely explanation for so few cases in these two areas is that legally proving fraud or voting machine manipulations are very time-consuming processes, that require substantial investigative work and documentation. There simply wasn’t enough time to do this prior to key points in the process (like the Electoral College).” “Our view is that the public needs to be much better educated regarding the election integrity issue—and having a more accurate understanding of the lawsuit component is a key part of that,” Droz wrote, explaining the purpose of his report."

‘Divided’ Supreme Court Rules On Fundamental Right To Worship,8 FEB 2021,3184,"Apparently, the left’s stronghold on the official government of the U.S. (not the population) is so deep that the Supreme Court actually was divided about upholding the First Amendment of the Constitution. The issue was church services… whether the government had the power to shut them down. Just The News reported: A divided Supreme Court late Friday night blocked California from imposing an outright ban on indoor church services during the pandemic, but the justices kept in place for the time being capacity limits and a ban on singing and chanting.  In a decision with four separate interpretations, a majority of conservative justices ruled that while the court normally defers to elected officials on public health that Gov. Gavin’s Newsom’s outright ban on church gatherings defied the Constitution. “The State’s  present  determination—that the  maximum  number  of  adherents  who  can  safely  worship in  the  most  cavernous  cathedral  is  zero—appears  to  reflect not expertise  or  discretion,  but instead  insufficient appreciation  or  consideration  of  the  interests  at  stake,” Chief Justice John Robert wrote in his partially concurring statement. The court’s three liberal judges dissented in granting a restraining order blocking California from imposing the ban. The Ruling amounted to another major win for religious freedom advocates, including the two churches who brought the challenge to the high court. “Respondents  are  enjoined  from  enforcing  the  Blueprint’s Tier  1  prohibition  on  indoor  worship  services  against  the applicants  pending  disposition  of  the  petition  for  a  writ  of certiorari,” the court ruled. “The  application  is  denied  with  respect  to  the  percentage  capacity  limitations,  and  respondents  are  not  enjoined  from  imposing  a  25%  capacity  limitation  on  indoor worship  services  in  Tier  1.   The application  is  denied  with respect  to  the  prohibition  on  singing  and  chanting  during indoor  services.” You can read the ruling here. File 20a136_bq7c.pdf The justices said the churches could come back to the court  if they could demonstrate “the State is  not  applying  the  percentage  capacity  limitations  or  the  prohibition  on singing  and  chanting  in a  generally  applicable  manner.” Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch supported banning all the restrictions while the court’s newest member Amy Comey Barrett said there wasn’t enough evidence to determine whether the singing ban only impacted churches or affected all venues. “It remains  unclear  whether  the  singing  ban applies  across  the  board  (and  thus  constitutes  a  neutral  and generally  applicable law)  or  else  favors  certain  sectors  (and thus  triggers  more  searching  review),” Barrett wrote.  “Of  course,  if  a  chorister  can  sing  in  a  Hollywood  studio  but  not  in  her  church, California’s  regulations  cannot  be  viewed  as  neutral.   But the record  is  uncertain,  and  the  decisions  below  unfortunately  shed  little light  on  the issue.” The level of fascist control now being carried out against the will of the people is worse than it ever was in 1776."
Catch And Release Going Full Steam: “They’re Filling Up Bus After Bus After Bus”,5 FEB 2021,5180,"Although Biden has been recently mocked for reinstituting the cages containing children, his administration is quickly releasing illegal aliens in the country without regard for the American people. CIS reported: Hundreds of Haitian migrants who are crossing the Rio Grande border in the normally staid Del Rio sector of Texas are enjoying the first return to “catch-and-release” policies since President Donald Trump’s administration all but eliminated them. U.S. Border Patrol and ICE are allowing hundreds of Haitians and other migrant nationalities who cross in the Del Rio region to avoid detention or quick return to Mexico; instead they are given Notices to Appear in immigration court at some point in the future and allowed to board Greyhound buses for other parts of the United States, according to federal sources and the head of a migrant-assistance agency helping the migrants. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in the region wouldn’t confirm or deny that migrants are benefitting from catch-and-release again. Catch-and-release was a practice, in response to an overwhelming number of migrants causing the breakdown of normal border control systems, that rewarded illegal crossers who claimed to fear returning to their home countries with long-term presence inside the United States for nearly one million Central Americans in 2019. It’s unclear how many migrants have benefitted from the reintroduction of catch-and-release in the Del Rio sector. But Shon Young, director of the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition in Del Rio, to which Border Patrol has been delivering migrants for help with travel arrangements, said his organization began receiving mostly Haitian and Cuban migrants since the day after Biden’s inauguration. “For some reason, the day after the inauguration, we had a big influx of people coming. So we fired up the coalition at full speed,” he said. Border Patrol began bringing increasing numbers of migrants a day to the coalition for about two months, and the numbers have trended upward to some 60 a day the last two weeks and then to more than 100 this past Sunday. Untold numbers of other migrants are winning catch-and-release downriver in the Eagle Pass area. Most of the migrants get their immigration court paperwork and head for other parts of the country aboard Greyhound buses but, Young said, many have the money to fly out. The Trump administration used Mexico push-back policies to sharply curtail such releases during the latter half of 2019 to control the migrant crisis at that time. Catch-and-release ended altogether in March when the Trump administration empowered the Border Patrol to quickly return many apprehended illegal migrants without process, a Covid-management policy known colloquially as Title 42, after the public-health section of the U.S. Code. The Biden administration has not formally rescinded the Title 42 expulsion order. CIS could not independently confirm the extent to which catch-and-release, which powerfully motivates migrants to illegally enter for the chance to stay indefinitely inside the United States, is now reintroduced, or why. But one Border Patrol agent in the area told CIS that the migrants are now too numerous for local systems to process, just like the catch-and-release circumstances that powered the 2019 crisis. “We are releasing hundreds from many different countries of origin because we simply don’t have enough room to hold them all,” the Border Patrol agent told the Center for Immigration Studies. “They are being released under what is called an O.R. which means ‘Own Recognizance’ – basically, a promise to arrive for their immigration hearing at some future date. We can’t hold them because they are crossing all day long in groups of 20 to 40, men, women, children.” Said one federal official in the area: “They’re filling bus after bus after bus.” No U.S. media has yet covered this incentivizing shift in practice as the number of migrants trying their luck at winning catch-and-release spikes ever upward. But Mexican media in the State of Coahuila across from Del Rio and Eagle Pass have reported that increasing numbers of migrants are heading toward the American border and that human smuggling activity is much higher than in previous years. There’s some indication in Mexican media that federal police and the national guard have moved to shut down the flow over the border, although the reason why the Mexican government would do that remains unclear currently. CBP’s refusal to confirm, deny, or explain the resumption of catch-and-release apparently has worked to keep the practice out of media limelight for weeks even as it motivated ever-higher numbers of migrants to cross the Rio Grande in this region. Local journalist Karen Gleason, who covered the 2019 catch-and-release migrant crisis, told CIS she’s been trying for a week to get Border Patrol officials to answer her questions, to no avail despite repeatedly efforts to make contact. “I have yet to hear back from them,” she said. “It’s complete radio silence, which is funny because back in 2019 they were very eager to talk to anyone who would listen about what they are doing.”"
Wisconsin Dem Gov Issues New Mask Order After Legislature Repealed Unconstitutional Control,5 FEB 2021,4219,"In Wisconsin, the elected state legislature repealed the unconstitutional control being carried out by democrat Governor Tony Evers. So, Evers simply did the same thing again. The Epoch Times reported: Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a new statewide mask order on Thursday, an hour after the Republican-controlled Legislature voted to repeal his previous mandate saying he didn’t have authority to make such a decree. Evers and the Legislature have been at odds throughout the pandemic but the latest moves created an unprecedented level of whiplash. Republican lawmakers last year persuaded the state Supreme Court to scrap Evers’ stay-at-home order and a state appeals court halted the limits he placed on indoor gatherings. As the Legislature moved to repeal the order, many cities and counties rushed to enact or extend local mask ordinances. Milwaukee and Dane County, where Madison is located, are among those with orders in place. [Areas controlled by democrats.] The Democratic governor said in a video message that his priority is keeping people safe and that wearing a mask is the most basic way to do that. “If the Legislature keeps playing politics and we don’t keep wearing masks, we’re going to see more preventable deaths, and it’s going to take even longer to get our state and our economy back on track,” Evers said. Republican state Sen. Steve Nass, who led the push to repeal the order, accused Evers of being a “lawless governor.” Nass said he was drafting another resolution to repeal the new order and was considering asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take emergency action. The Supreme Court could end the legislative back and forth with a ruling in a pending case that says Evers must secure lawmakers’ approval every 60 days. The court could also say he doesn’t need approval, thus forcing the Legislature to repeal every order Evers issues if it wants to stop him. The attorney who argued in the case to undo Evers’ order, Rick Esenberg, said “it is now incumbent upon the courts to rein in this abuse of power.” Republicans say the issue isn’t about masks, but whether Evers can legally issue multiple emergency health orders during the pandemic. The Legislature argues he can’t, and must secure their approval every 60 days. Evers contends the changing nature of the pandemic allowed him to issue multiple orders and mask mandates. “I know you want to make it about masks. It’s not,” said Republican Majority Leader Jim Steineke. “It’s about the rule of law.” [Others point out that many medical experts have repeatedly stated that masks are completely ineffective for stopping the transmission of this sort of respiratory virus… but facts have never concerned the left… only control.] The Assembly voted 52-42 to repeal the mandate, with seven Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition. The vote came a week after the Senate voted to kill the mandate. Republicans, who control both chambers, argued that Evers exceeded his authority by repeatedly extending the mask mandate without legislative approval. The repeal hadn’t even taken effect before Evers issued a new one. The coronavirus has ebbed in Wisconsin and elsewhere in the U.S., but health experts have warned of a continuing danger, including the emergence of new and more contagious variants. All of Wisconsin’s neighboring states have some form of mask mandate, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. Prior to Thursday’s vote, Assembly Republicans sent Evers a letter saying they would support a more limited mask mandate that applies to places “susceptible to transmission of the virus.” Republicans said that includes health care facilities, nursing homes, mass transit, state government buildings, assisted living facilities, public schools, universities and prisons. The Assembly also passed a bill that contains a provision designed to ensure the state doesn’t lose about $50 million a month that pays for food stamp benefits for roughly 243,000 low-income people in the state. Federal law requires there to be an emergency health order in place to receive the money. The Senate planned to meet Friday to approve the bill, sending it to Evers. Evers has not said whether he will sign the bill."
19-Year-Old Hospitalized After Second Dose Of COVID Vaccine,2 FEB 2021,1887,"Many experts argue that there is just not enough information about mRNA vaccines for the COVID ‘cure’ to be an acceptable risk. Jerusalem Post reported: A 19-year-old was hospitalized with myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – five days after receiving his second dose of the coronavirus vaccine, Terem emergency medical clinic reported Monday. According to the clinic, it has still not been confirmed that the inflammation was developed as a side effect of the vaccination. However, a number of COVID-19-related myocarditis cases have been reported, according to the US National Institutes of Health. “The fact that the symptoms started immediately after the vaccination raises the suspicion that an immunological reaction may have caused the inflammation,” said Dr. Abdulhadi Farojeh, a Terem medical director. The young man received treatment at a Terem center in Modi’in on Sunday night before being transferred for further treatment to Shamir Medical Center in Tzrifin. From when he had received the second dose, he had experienced an accelerated heartbeat, along with shortness of breath and sharp pains that were radiating down his left arm, according to Terem’s Dr. Badarnih Bahaa. Terem took blood tests that revealed the heart inflammation. Without treatment, myocarditis can lead to cardiac arrhythmia and even death. The 19-year-old had no underlying medical conditions prior to the event. In general, most people who are vaccinated have mild if any side effects, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry shared a report on Monday evening that showed only 6,575 reported side effects out of 2,768,200 people who had received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine by January 27, and only 3,592 reported side effects out of 1,377,827 people who received a second dose. “It should be emphasized that most of the symptoms were mild and fleeting,” the ministry said."
Canadian Mother In Tears After Son Taken To “Undisclosed” Location To Take “Test”,1 FEB 2021,3362,"In Canada, apparently the people have no rights when it involves COVID. A mother isn’t being told where her son is being held. Western Standard reported: A Red Deer mom has told of her anguish after watching her son being detained at the Calgary airport, loaded into a van, and taken to an undisclosed isolation centre. Rebekah McDonald was at the airport late Saturday night, hoping to welcome her son, Ethan, back to Calgary from Pheonix, Arizona. McDonald hadn’t seen her son for two years. But the joy soon turned to tears when her son was taken into custody for having what the Canadian federal government considers the wrong COVID-19 test. “They are saying it’s not accurate and they are wanting to take him to a quarantine facility. They won’t let me talk to him. They won’t let me see him. They won’t come and talk to me. The border patrol services say they have nothing to do with it – they won’t tell me who has to do with it,” said McDonald in a social media video as she walked through the airport concourse. “They won’t tell me who’s picking him up. They won’t tell me where he’s going. They won’t tell me anything. “They say he doesn’t have a choice, that it’s the law. They say I don’t have the right to talk to him. They are taking him against my will and his will and I’m not okay with it. I don’t know what to do about it and I don’t know where I’m supposed to find him. “I’m freaking out,” said McDonald, dissolving into tears. In a bid to level off the number of COVID-19 cases being brought in by returning travellers, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday upon their arrival back in Canada, they will be taken to an isolation facility and given another coronavirus test. If testing negative after three days, they will be able to leave the government facility and finish the rest of their quarantine period at home. If positive, they are taken to another isolation location for the 14-day time frame. In a later social media post, McDonald said her worries are being extended because the health officials in question don’t work weekends. “I’m just angry now – there is zero accountability, there’s no questions asked, there is nobody you can hold accountable for this,” she said. “I just want people to ask themselves what kind of Canada they want to live in. People fight long and hard for freedom and this just feels really wrong. It is really wrong.” Ok Albertans. This is URGENT Let’s help Rebekah McDonald find her son. He was detained at the Calgary airport last night. Please share. Original link will be posted at end of thread. This is unacceptable. What kind of province and country has Alberta Canada become? pic.twitter.com/k0gc2NdoNH — Dustin PREM-SINGH-Penner (@Dustinpenner25) January 31, 2021 Part two update from 2:30am pic.twitter.com/eP1M51Ioya — Dustin PREM-SINGH-Penner (@Dustinpenner25) January 31, 2021 McDonald post The McDonald case was at least the second one at the Calgary airport to cause anguish amongst families. Edmonton Pastor Chris Mathews told of his terrifying experience at the airport Thursday night when he went to pick up his wife, Nikki. She had been given the wrong test in Dallas and was whisked to the isolation centre after she landed at YYC. The Justice Centre for Constitution Freedoms (JCCF) say they will file immediate court challenges to Trudeau plan saying it’s unconstitutional."
Ohio Nurse Forced To Take Vaccine Dies Within 48 Hours Of First Dose,30 JAN 2021,3589,"The number of people who have died from the COVID vaccine in the US continues to climb… reports of over 250 have been released. Lifesite News reported: A 39-year-old woman with no known comorbidities died unexpectedly in northern Ohio within 48 hours of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, which was reportedly required by her employer. Janet L. Moore, a nurse aide at Admirals Pointe Nursing Home (APNH) in Huron, was found unresponsive in her car outside her apartment complex on December 31 around 8:00 p.m., her brother Jacob Gregory told LifeSiteNews. “She was coming home from work and as soon as she drove into her parking lot she passed away,” he said. “According to her neighbors she wasn’t feeling good directly after the vaccine, and then ever since the vaccine she was actually feeling nauseated, she’d have like migraines and stuff like that. And then, within 48 hours, she ended up passing away.” When asked if he knew the brand of the vaccine, Gregory, who lives in Akron, said, “According to my brother, it was by Pfizer, but I’m not absolutely sure on that.” Gregory mentioned that his deceased sister, a mother of two sons, was required to receive this vaccine due to her nursing home employment. Top of Form Bottom of Form“Yes, it was a mandatory vaccine that she had to take for her job,” he said. When asked if it was a condition for her employment, he answered, “As far as that extent, I’m not sure how much pressure they are actually pushing. They did tell her that she needs it for her job, but I’m not exactly sure if they were going to lay her off, or fire her, or to what extent it would actually take.” Trisha Brown, Administrator at APNH, declined to comment on whether it was the policy of their organization to require the vaccine, if Moore actually received such an injection, or whether they were administering a Pfizer or Moderna product. A nursing home in Janesville, Wisconsin, which mandated their employees receive these experimental biological agents did in fact lay off workers who declined the injections. Nearly a dozen employees were forced from their jobs due to the policy, and 27 wrote letters of complaint seeking to have the policy changed. Their concerns included how this biological agent, which was rushed through development and testing, may have dangerous, unknown long-term effects, while others expressed worries about it affecting their pregnancy or fertility. More generally they objected to being told they had to take a vaccine which was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While these vaccines have been given emergency use authorization by the FDA, neither has the full approval of the agency. Estimates from the American Health Care Association suggest that around 50 percent of long-term care staff are declining the injections. The U.K. government issued a 10-page report late last year that warned coronavirus vaccines should not be used by pregnant or breastfeeding mothers. With regard to their impact on fertility, the document simply states it is “unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.” Safety concerns with these vaccines also include “allergic” and “potentially fatal reactions,” that they may actually cause an increased vulnerability to the virus, and that, indeed, worries over long-term effects remain legitimate as these vaccines lack proper testing. In addition, the FDA also drew up a document this fall listing the possible side-effects from a COVID-19 vaccine, including strokes, encephalitis, auto-immune disease, birth defects, Kawasaki disease, and death."
Gates Funds Controversial GMO Mosquito Experiment To ‘Fight Malaria’: Releases “Hermaphrodite” Insects to Eliminate Them All,30 JAN 2021,11643,"A new ‘experiment’ largely funded by, you guessed it, Bill Gates, is being conducted to genetically modify mosquitoes in order to basically kill them off completely. Apparently Gates believes he knows better than God on how to operate Creation. The highly controversial activity is like a Pandora’s box… it can’t be undone. And many people argue that Gates’ actions over the past decade clearly point to the plan of eliminating mankind… except of course for a few elites. NPR reported: Scientists have launched a major new phase in the testing of a controversial genetically modified organism: a mosquito designed to quickly spread a genetic mutation lethal to its own species, NPR has learned. For the first time, researchers have begun large-scale releases of the engineered insects, into a high-security laboratory in Terni, Italy. “This will really be a breakthrough experiment,” says Ruth Mueller, an entomologist who runs the lab. “It’s a historic moment.” The goal is to see if the mosquitoes could eventually provide a powerful new weapon to help eradicate malaria in Africa, where most cases occur. “It’s very exciting,” Mueller says. NPR was the only news organization allowed into the lab to witness the moment the releases began in early February. The lab was specially built to evaluate the modified insects in as close to a natural environment as possible without the risk of releasing them into the wild, about which there are deep concerns regarding unforeseen effects on the environment. “This is an experimental technology which could have devastating impacts,” says Dana Perls of Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that’s part of an international coalition fighting this new generation of modified organisms. To prevent any unforeseen effects on the environment, scientists have always tried to keep genetically engineered organisms from spreading their mutations. But in this case, researchers want the modification to spread. So they engineered mosquitoes with a “gene drive.” A gene drive is like a “selfish gene,” Mueller says, because it doesn’t follow the normal rules of genetics. Normally, traits are passed to only half of all offspring. With the gene drive, nearly all the progeny inherit the modification. “All the offspring. All the children — the mosquito children — have this modification,” Mueller says. Researchers created the mosquitoes by using the powerful new gene-editing technique known as CRISPR, which Mueller likens to a “molecular scissor which can cut at a specific site in the DNA.” The cut altered a gene known as “doublesex,” which is involved in the sexual development of the mosquitoes. “The females become a bit more male,” Mueller says. “A kind of hermaphrodite.” While genetically female, the transformed insects have mouths that resemble male mosquito mouths. That means they can’t bite and so can’t spread the malaria parasite. In addition, the insects’ reproductive organs are deformed, which means they can’t lay eggs. As more and more female mosquitoes inherit two copies of the modification, more and more become sterile. The idea is that if these modified mosquitoes are eventually shown to be safe and effective, they might someday be released in African villages plagued by malaria. The hope is that they would spread their mutation and eventually sterilize all the females. That would crash — or drastically reduce — local populations of the main species of mosquito that spreads malaria, known as Anopheles gambiae. “Malaria is a huge problem affecting probably two-thirds of the world’s population,” says Tony Nolan, who helped develop the mosquitoes at Imperial College London. He is now at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Malaria sickens more than 200 million people each year and kills more than 400,000, mostly young children. Scientists think gene-drive organisms could help solve many problems, including wiping out other insect-borne diseases such as Zika and dengue. Gene-drive creatures might also save endangered ecosystems by eradicating invasive rodents. They could help feed the world by creating more efficient crops. But critics fear that gene-drive organisms could run amok and wreak havoc if they were ever released into the wild. The insects could inadvertently have a negative effect on crops, for example, by eliminating important pollinators, they fear. The insects’ population crash could also lead to other mosquitoes coming with other diseases, critics say. “We can’t be taking lightly this extermination technology,” Perls says. “We need to slow down. We need to hit the pause button on gene drives.” Some activists in Africa agree. “This is a technology where we don’t know where it’s going to end. We need to stop this right where it is,” says Nnimmo Bassey, director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation in Nigeria. “They’re trying to use Africa as a big laboratory to test risky technologies.” The experiment is a key step in the Target Malaria project. The project’s major funder is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which also supports NPR and this blog. Nolan and Mueller say the project is working methodically and cautiously to assess the mosquitoes in close consultation with scientists, government officials and local residents in Africa. In addition, the gene-drive mosquitoes would affect just one of hundreds of mosquito species. “There’s going to be concerns with any technology. But I don’t think you should throw out a technology without having done your best to understand what its potential is to be transformative for medicine. And, were it to work, this would be transformative,” Nolan says. Other experts agree. “If my kids lived in Africa, I’d say, ‘Go for it as quickly as possible,’ ” says Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Esvelt is a gene-drive pioneer who has repeatedly warned scientists to move cautiously with the technology because it is so powerful. But Esvelt thinks Target Malaria has been acting responsibly. “The known harm of malaria so outweighs the combined harms of everything that has been postulated could go wrong ecologically,” Esvelt says. The project plans years of additional study to evaluate the mosquitoes and possible environmental impacts, as well as social and political consultations to build a consensus for when a release would be permitted. That’s probably at least five years away, Nolan says. On the day NPR visited the Terni lab, Mueller demonstrated several layers of security at the lab to keep any mosquitoes from escaping. She noted that the experiment is being conducted in Italy, where this species of mosquito could not survive the climate even if the insects did escape. “We really want to show that we work very, very sound and responsible about this new technology,” Mueller says. To enter the most secure part of the facility, Mueller punches a security code into a keypad to open a sliding glass door. As the door seals, a powerful blower makes sure none of the genetically modified mosquitoes inside escape. Anyone entering must don white lab coats to make it easier to spot any mosquitoes that might try to hitch a ride out of the lab and must pass through a second sealed door and blower. Once inside, Mueller points to a small container made out of white mosquito netting. Inside are dozens of mosquitoes. “Here we have gene-drive mosquitoes — these genetically modified mosquitoes,” she says. The insects quickly crashed populations of their natural counterparts in small cages in a secure basement lab at Imperial College London. The new experiment is designed to test them in a hot and humid environment more closely resembling their natural habitat in the African countries where this species of mosquito lives. “This helps us understand better how a gene-drive release would work in the real world,” she says. Mueller heads to a large, thick metal door. “We will now enter the experimental chamber where the release takes place today,” she says. The chamber houses six huge “cages.” The 9-foot-high cage walls are made out of white mosquito netting to keep the insects contained. The netting stretches from the floor to the ceiling. Each cage contains hundreds of unmodified mosquitoes. Every cage is equipped with several features designed to replicate the conditions in which the mosquitoes live in the wild. The idea is to encourage the mosquitoes’ natural behavior. The cages’ features include stacks of moist clay hollow cylinders for the mosquitoes to use as shelters. Also, large black boxes with white backgrounds are inside the cages. The contrasting colors stimulate swarming, which is when the mosquitoes mate. A computer precisely controls the light in the chamber to simulate sunrise and sunset and the natural changes in intensity and color throughout the day. “OK, we can start,” Mueller says as several of her colleagues crowd into the chamber. After pulling on rubber gloves, lead technician Tania Persampieri carefully picks up a tray holding glass dishes, each containing dozens of the modified mosquitoes in the pupal stage of development. They’re squirming around in water. Persampieri slowly walks over to the first cage, squats down and picks up one of the dishes holding the mosquito pupae. She gently slides the dish through an opening in the netting that prevents any insects from escaping and places the vessel on the floor. “The experiment has now started,” Mueller says. “It’s very exciting.” Persampieri and her co-workers move quietly to avoid unnecessarily stressing the mosquitoes. Persampieri releases immature gene-drive mosquitoes in four of the six cages. Two cages receive amounts equal to 25 percent of the unmodified populations already in the cages; two cages receive amounts equal to 50 percent. The remaining two cages will be used for comparison and so don’t receive any modified insects. Other technicians slide canisters of warm cow’s blood into each cage. “We heat up the blood because this is attractive for the mosquitoes. They don’t like cold blood. They want to have a living animal where they can bite in,” Mueller says. As the researchers are finishing, the lights in the cage chamber start to dim. “It’s a slow dimming and also a specific light color — very orange, very warm color — so that they really feel like [they’re] having a sunset,” Mueller says. That’s key because sunset is when male mosquitoes start their mating dance. “The males make swarms — many mosquito males flying around,” Mueller says. “It looks a bit like dancing.” As the males swarm, females fly in and select a male; then the pair flies out to mate. “They couple and make babies,” Mueller says. Mueller and her colleagues are collecting thousands of eggs from the cages every week to monitor how well the sterilizing mutation is spreading. The researchers hope to know within six months to a year whether the modified mosquitoes dance well enough to efficiently spread their lethal modification in the wild. “Maybe you can see already if you go a bit nearer,” Mueller says, pointing to a few mosquitoes that have begun flying around inside the black boxes. Turns out, Terni is home to a shrine to St. Valentine. And the experiment is beginning just before Valentine’s Day. So the basilica’s annual Valentine’s Day celebrations are just beginning as well with a church service at his shrine. As she watches the modified mosquitoes start their first mating ritual in her lab, Mueller muses, with a laugh: “It’s very romantic.” “Romantic” to think that a major insect in the food chain could disappear, causing God knows what sort of catastrophic results to humans?"
New York Nursing Home Scandal Explodes: Governor Has “Blood On His Hands” From “Criminal Cover Up”,29 JAN 2021,9466,"New York Attorney General Letitia James has exposed the lies carried out concerning COVID deaths in nursing homes. The “criminal cover up” means that Cuomo has “blood on his hands.” Townhall reported: It’s finally happening,” Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean wrote on Twitter on Thursday. “@NYGovCuomo is going to have to answer for his role in the nursing home tragedy and the cover up. The angels won.” After months of investigative work, New York Attorney General Letitia James and her office released their report on the number of COVID-related fatalities in state nursing homes. Over the summer, the New York State Department of Health reported that just over 6,600 people had died from COVID. But as predicted, that number appears to have been severely undercounted, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, the attorney general regretted to announce. New York was the only state in the nation with a major outbreak to not include in their count those individuals who died from COVID after being transferred to the hospital. Among those findings were that a larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than the New York State Department of Health’s (DOH) published nursing home data reflected and may have been undercounted by as much as 50 percent. The investigations also revealed that nursing homes’ lack of compliance with infection control protocols put residents at increased risk of harm, and facilities that had lower pre-pandemic staffing ratings had higher COVID-19 fatality rates. Based on these findings and subsequent investigation, Attorney General James is conducting ongoing investigations into more than 20 nursing homes whose reported conduct during the first wave of the pandemic presented particular concern. NEW: @TishJames releases scathing report on New York State Nursing Homes. Among the findings is that @HealthNYGov UNDERREPORTED nursing home deaths due to Covid by 50%. 20 facilities remain under investigation. Big development here is James taking aim squarely at @NYGovCuomo — Zack Fink (@ZackFinkNews) January 28, 2021 “As the pandemic and our investigations continue, it is imperative that we understand why the residents of nursing homes in New York unnecessarily suffered at such an alarming rate,” said Attorney General James. “While we cannot bring back the individuals we lost to this crisis, this report seeks to offer transparency that the public deserves and to spur increased action to protect our most vulnerable residents. Nursing homes residents and workers deserve to live and work in safe environments, and I will continue to work hard to safeguard this basic right during this precarious time.” Janice Dean, who lost both of her in-laws to COVID in separate New York nursing homes, is among many New Yorkers who blame Gov. Cuomo’s nursing home mandate for the tragedies. The order essentially forced elder care facilities to accept recovering COVID patients. Update: New York lawmakers like Rep. Elise Stefanik and Nicole Malliotakis are beginning to sound off on the devastating report. “This is now more than a nursing home scandal, this is a massive corruption and coverup scandal at the highest level of New York State Government implicating the Governor, the Secretary to the Governor, the New York State Health Commissioner and the Governor’s staff,” Stefanik said in a statement. “Every New Yorker deserves transparency, accountability and answers regarding the orchestration of this illegal coverup. I am calling on the New York Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Justice to issue subpoenas immediately of Governor Cuomo and his entire staff on all documentation and internal and external communications, including with any and all associations and lobbyists who have direct ties to the Governor’s senior team related to this corrupt and illegal coverup. I am committed to doing everything I can in my power to protect the independence of the ongoing federal investigation into Governor Cuomo’s nursing home disaster. President Joe Biden should pledge to do the same. As a fellow New Yorker, I want to publicly thank the effective and tireless advocates who have humbly served as the voice of their lost loved ones and have faced inexcusably cruel treatment from the Governor and his entire team, who we know have orchestrated a criminal coverup and have blood on their hands.” Congresswoman Malliotakis’ statement on New York State Severely Undercounting Nursing Home Deaths ??https://t.co/e00IpnZj1s pic.twitter.com/KN5xF3Pb0j — Office of Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (@RepMalliotakis) January 28, 2021 Flashback: Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found FLASHBACK: Last May a New York Nurse Whistleblower came forward on Cuomo https://t.co/PlZ9fp3WxS — Jack Posobiec  (@JackPosobiec) January 29, 2021 The New York Post reported: The bombshell findings could push the current DOH tally of 8,711 deaths to more than 13,000, based on a survey of 62 nursing homes that found the state undercounted the fatalities there by an average of 56 percent. The report further notes that at least 4,000 residents died after the state issued a controversial, March 25 Cuomo administration mandate for nursing homes to admit “medically stable” coronavirus patients — which James said “may have put residents at increased risk of harm in some facilities.” “As the pandemic and our investigations continue, it is imperative that we understand why the residents of nursing homes in New York unnecessarily suffered at such an alarming rate,” James said. “While we cannot bring back the individuals we lost to this crisis, this report seeks to offer transparency that the public deserves and to spur increased action to protect our most vulnerable residents.” FDNY emergency medical technicians transport a man from a nursing home into an ambulance in Brooklyn, New York.REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Vivian Zayas — who founded the Voices for Seniors advocacy group after her mom, who lived in a Long Island nursing home, died of COVID-19 last year — said that “our jaws dropped” upon reading James’ report. “The attorney general’s report shows that Cuomo’s book on his great leadership during the pandemic is a fraud,” she said. “It’s a fraud and insult to the families. He’s a fraud and his book is a fraud.” Asked about the finding during a morning news conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, “We have to make sense of this. We have to get the full truth. … And we have to be honest about the numbers.” “These are our loved ones that we lost,” de Blasio said. “It’s someone’s grandma, it’s someone’s mother or father, aunt or uncle. This is families missing someone dear to them.” He added: “Among all the other pain that we went through in 2020, this was arguably the worst part of it.” Bill Hammond of the Empire Center, a government watchdog group that has sued the state DOH for access to its data on the deaths of all nursing home residents, called James’ report “independent confirmation of a lot of the concerns and criticisms that have been raised.” “It highlights major discrepancies in the reporting on deaths and makes clear that state policy and oversight of nursing homes was at least one factor in the tragic loss of life,” he said. Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, with a spokesperson saying officials were still reviewing James’ report. Cuomo, despite his administration’s order to keep the COVID afflicted among nursing home residents, has repeatedly acknowledged the danger that the coronavirus posed to such an elderly population. “Coronavirus in a nursing home is like fire in dry grass … The only question is how many people will die?” he said on March 29 — without mentioning the controversial directive that his health commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, had issued four days earlier. Cuomo later used the same metaphor while suggesting in June that, “All you need is one person — an air-conditioning repairman, a delivery person —  and once that virus gets in the nursing home, it’s fire through dry grass,” Lawmakers and nursing home advocates alike have been critical of the Cuomo administration’s virus-related policies governing nursing home protocols.Pacific Press/LightRocket via Ge The following month — amid sustained outrage over the March 25 directive, which was revoked on May 10 — the DOH issued a report blaming the spread of the coronavirus in nursing homes on asymptomatic staffers. Cuomo has also repeatedly attacked The Post for its hard-hitting reports on the nursing-home crisis, suggesting the coverage was politically motivated to “kill all Democrats.” And during spectacularly ill-timed appearances Tuesday on MSNBC and CNN, Cuomo tried to blame for COVID deaths on former President Donald Trump, offering one quote that seems to now apply equally to his own administration in light of the James report. “Incompetent government kills people. More people died than needed to die in COVID. That’s the truth,” he said. James’ report does not increase the number of overall deaths in the Empire State from the coronavirus, which stands at an estimated 42,887 confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University case tracker. The state DOH puts the number at 34,579, but that tally only includes confirmed deaths. And, many people point out that these are COVID “related” deaths… and as other investigations have shown, often this ‘definition’ has been used to inflate ‘pandemic’ numbers.’"
Biden Orders State Dept To Resume Relations With Terrorist Hamas,28 JAN 2021,3311,"It hasn’t even been a week, but Joe Biden has ordered the Department of State to resume relations with the terrorists of Hamas. The massive peace deals brokered by President Trump in the Middle East seem ready to fall victim to the democrat war machine, many argue. PJ Media reported: The stupidity of the Biden administration is evident in the statement accompanying the recognition of the Palestinians. It “remains the best way to ensure Israel’s future as a democratic and Jewish state while upholding the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for a state of their own and to live with dignity and security.” I’m not sure a lot of Israelis would agree with that statement. Biden’s next move will be to start the gravy train of assistance to the Palestinian government. Perhaps he’ll invite Mahmoud Abbas to the White House for some nice friendly chit-chat. A new wind is blowing through the Middle East — an ill-favored wind. Associated Press: “Under the new administration, the policy of the United States will be to support a mutually agreed two-state solution, one in which Israel lives in peace and security alongside a viable Palestinian state,” he said. Mills said peace can’t be imposed on either side and stressed that progress and an ultimate solution require the participation and agreement of Israelis and Palestinians. “In order to advance these objectives, the Biden administration will restore credible U.S. engagement with Palestinians as well as Israelis,” he said. “Credible engagement” with the Palestinians necessarily means accepting some of their claims. First and foremost is that “Palestine” is a viable state. The rest of the world may pretend that it is, but that doesn’t mean the U.S. has to share the delusion. As long as the Palestinians hold a knife to Israel’s throat, all the wishful thinking in the world won’t matter. Trump cut off funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency known as UNRWA, which was established to aid the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes during the war surrounding Israel’s establishment in 1948. It provides education, health care, food and other assistance to some 5.5 million refugees and their descendants in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The U.S. was UNRWA’s major donor and the loss of funds has created a financial crisis for the agency. The Trump administration closed the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington in September 2018, effectively shutting down the Palestinians’ diplomatic mission to the United States. Why did Trump cut off funding for UNRWA? Is it that he’s an inhuman monster? Or was UNRWA assisting the Hamas terrorists? Heritage Foundation: Substantial evidence indicates that the UNRWA has contributed to Palestinian extremism. For instance: If the Palestinians ever throw off the yoke of Hamas and the PLO and embrace the future of their people, not dwell in the past, there might be hope for a meaningful peace between the Palestinian people and the Jewish state. But the terrorists have the guns and have shown in the past how brutally they deal with “traitors” who advocate peace. Until then, Israel and her friends may want to stay alert and keep their powder dry. With friends like Biden, the terrorists are likely to become bolder."

What happened to FrEe MaRkEt? — Chef Andrew Gruel (@ChefGruel) January 27, 2021 Beyond parody! WH Press Sec. says we don't need to focus on the stock market because the Treasury Secretary is a woman. https://t.co/ITSCLahpxF — Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) January 27, 2021 The video at the bottom is worth watching, because it explains what’s happening and why every media outlet is scrambling to label these few people as domestic terrorists. The Epoch Times explained yesterday: A sizable group of small investors has threatened to bankrupt Wall Street hedge funds that have sought to profit from the downfall of the video game retailer GameStop. The investors have organized online to buy GameStop’s stock, forcing billions in losses on the establishment players that had bet on the company’s failure. The exact origin of the phenomenon is hard to pinpoint but some have attributed it to an anonymous member of the Reddit forum called “r/wallstreetbets.” The forum sports over 3 million members and focuses on retail investment, meaning investment by individuals, typically of small sums, into stocks and bonds. Members of the forum noticed that Melvin Capital Management, a hedge fund worth reportedly over $12 billion, was holding a massive short position in GameStop—the company was betting more than $55 million on GameStop’s stock sinking, according to startup investor Shaan Puri. Members of the forum rallied their ranks to bet against Melvin by buying GameStop shares. The GameStop price had been declining for years, from more than $16 per share in 2018 to less than $4 per share in early 2020, as its business model of selling physical box video games in brick shops was supplanted by online sales. The company was boosted later last year when Chewy.com founder Ryan Cohen bought a 9 percent stake and joined its board, giving some investors hope that he might revive the declining retailer. But Wall Street analysts were still predicting a downturn. Around mid-January, the price started to go up rapidly to more than $30 on Jan. 13 and over $40 on Jan. 21. By the next day, Melvin was down nearly 30 percent, and needed Citadel and Point72 Asset Management to shore it up with a nearly $3 billion investment, The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 25. By that time, GameStop was up to more than $75. But that was just the beginning. On Jan. 26, GameStop price climbed to nearly $150 per share. Melvin announced it was able to close its position in the company that afternoon, taking an undisclosed loss, CNBC reported. Many members of the Reddit forum don’t seem to believe the hedge fund in fact managed to close out. On Jan. 27, GameStop soared to more than $300 a share. At that point, the Reddit user that allegedly started the movement several months ago by investing some $750,000 in GameStop stood to gain over $16 million on the deal. Many users also seem to be targeting the stock of Blackberry, a struggling phone company. The stock price has climbed in recent weeks from less than $7 per share to more than $22. Where Is This Going? Based on recent popular posts on the Reddit forum, the investors are betting that many Wall Street players are still holding large short positions in GameStop and are struggling to get out of them. The investors are urging each other to not sell and in fact keep buying, even at the high price. The apparent goal is to force a situation where institutional investors no longer have any GameStop stock to sell, but at least some of them still hold short positions, which would force them to buy the stock from the small investors. If the small investors refuse to sell, the price could climb to exorbitant heights. How Shorting Works? Shorting refers to selling a borrowed stock. Let’s say a friend of ours buys two cars for $10,000 each. We have a hunch that these exact cars will get much cheaper in just a few months so we ask the friend if we can borrow the cars for some time. He says it’s ok to borrow one if we pledge our watch as a collateral, but if we want to borrow the other one too, we’ll have to pay a small rental fee. We agree. Right after borrowing them, we’ll sell the cars for a total of $20,000. We keep paying the small fee. Three months later, a new model comes out causing a glut of cars on the market. The old model now costs only $8,000. We buy two and return them to the original owner. We made $4,000 minus the fees by “short selling” the cars. Alternatively, we borrow the cars and sell them, but then a car factory shuts down, causing a car shortage that sends the price up to, say, $12,000 a piece. We can keep waiting for the price to go down, but at some point the owner may come to us and say he wants his cars back as he wants to make some money by selling them at a higher price now. We have no other option than to buy two new cars at the higher price so we can return them to the owner, losing $4,000 plus the fees on the gambit. So what is a “short squeeze”? Imagine we are not the only ones in the exact same situation described earlier. When the price of the cars starts to go up and reaches, say, $11,000 a piece, other short sellers may decide to hedge their losses by buying some cars. Their doing so causes the price of the cars to go up even higher, “squeezing” our position. The GameStop situation is akin to a group of people creating the squeeze intentionally. They organize to buy all the cars they can get their hands on. Eventually, the short sellers can get to a point where they are forced to return what they borrowed by buying from this organized group of investors, since they are the only ones left having any cars for sale. The investors can then virtually dictate the price. On the other hand, if the short sellers manage to all close out, the stock is likely to drop and those who bought into the rush late would be stuck holding the bag. Can the Big Guys Stop This? Shorting is always a gamble since the owner of the stock that’s being borrowed can, at any time, demand it back, forcing the short seller to go buy it at whatever is the current price. In practice, this rarely happens because short selling is accommodated by large investment firms that hold massive portfolios of stocks. If the original owner wants his stock back, the investment firm simply replaces it for the short seller. That is the case with GameStop shares too. The largest investment manager of them all, the $8.6 trillion behemoth BlackRock, disclosed on Jan. 26 it just sold some 2 million GameStop shares and still had about 9 million left. The company can thus rescue, for a hefty compensation, the hedge funds stuck with GameStop shorts. Yet some members of the Reddit forum predict that Wall Street had in fact shorted GameStop much more than it lets on. So much that even the BlackRock portfolio won’t be enough. The New York Stock Exchange halted GameStop trading several times but that didn’t do much. The exchange may eventually resort to a longer suspension. Government regulators could also look into whether the GameStop rush was fueled by spreading false or misleading information, which would be illegal. [Bwhahahahahaha…that sort of thing only happens when the rich and powerful don’t benefit, many argue.] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement on Jan. 27 it was “actively monitoring” market volatility. Some members of the Reddit forum reject this, saying that correctly identifying an overly shorted stock and investing in it based on a prediction of a short squeeze is a legitimate investment strategy. In the evening of Jan. 27 the Reddit forum was made private by its moderators who said they could no longer manage to moderate the onslaught of new activity. Meanwhile social media platform Discord took down the forum’s discussion server. What Does This All Mean? Establishment players appear to view the GameStop rush as misguided if not malicious. But small investors seem to view it as a form of revolt as they see institutional Wall Street as unfairly playing the market to its advantage and their disadvantage. Hedge funds in particular are sometimes seen as taking advantage of struggling companies. Still, if the government steps in, it will probably be on the side of the establishment players, warned Dan David, founder of due diligence firm Wolfpack Research, in a recent Bannon’s War Room interview. Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya in a recent CNBC interview backed the small investors’ right to do what they are doing, even if it doesn’t turn out to their advantage. As long as institutional investors are allowed to take advantage of short term swings in stock prices, the small guy should be allowed to make analogous moves too, he said. “There’s a small part of momentum, there’s a part that’s fundamental analysis, and then there’s a part that’s just sticking it to the man,” he described of the situation. The Epoch Times reported on the Biden administration’s scramble: Following several days of significant short squeezes of stocks such as Gamestop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and others, the White House is looking into the situation. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are both “monitoring the situation.” [Thank goodness there’s a woman in that position, right? Apparently, gender is the only thing that matters.] “The stock market isn’t the only measure of the health of our economy,” she stated at a press briefing, adding that it “doesn’t reflect how working or middle-class families are doing.” [Experts debunked that immediately.] Psaki started off her answer by mentioning that Yellen is the first female Treasury secretary. She was responding to a question from a White House reporter about whether there have been “conversations with the [Security and Exchange Commission]” about the short squeeze initiative, which appears to be spreading via the sub-Reddit Wallstreetbets, Twitter, and 4chan. According to Reuters, “Retail traders scored against professionals on Wednesday as hedge funds Citron and Melvin retreated with heavy losses on short positions in GameStop in the week-long battle between Wall Street and Main Street, with more calling for scrutiny of anonymous stock trading posts on social media.” Meanwhile, TD Ameritrade told customers that the firm is blocking some trades for AMC, Gamestop, and certain securities. “We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,” read a notification from TD, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Because the rules are changing, people don’t like that,” technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC. “We are moving to a world where ordinary folk have the same access as professionals and can come to the same conclusion or maybe the opposite. The solution is more transparency on the institutional side not less access for retail.” A Reddit spokesperson told Reuters that the website has not been contacted by federal authorities about the Wallstreetbets board. “It does have a David and Goliath feel where the Reddit crowd is taking on the most shorted stocks by the largest hedge funds in the world and winning,” stated Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to Reuters. But some financial managers warned about the possibility of what could happen next. “It’s a dangerous game to play from both sides of the spectrum, whether you’re long or short,” said Matthew Keator, managing partner in wealth management firm the Keator Group in Massachusetts, reported Reuters. “You get close enough to the fire you’re going to get burned … it won’t matter what social media is cheering the stock on.” The Epoch Times has reached out to the Securities and Exchange Commission for comment. The DC Patriot explained it a bit more: Well that didn’t take long, the liberals over at Fake News CNN are at it again. This time trying to blame former President Donald J. Trump for the GameStop $GME Stock Surge that took place on Wednesday and hammered investors. That’s right, the CNN Editor Chris Cillizza at Large is blaming President Trump for people revolting against the system. Here’s a tid bit from the article in question blaming Trump for what happened today with GameStop. Trump elucidated this argument in its purest form at a rally in North Dakota in 2018 when he went on this riff: “I meet these people they call them ‘the elite.’ These people. I look at them, I say, ‘That’s elite?’ We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we’re smarter than they are, and they say they’re elite? We’re the elite. You’re the elite. We’re the elite.” “So I said the other day, let’s keep calling these people—and let’s face it, they’ve been stone-cold losers, the elite, the elite—so let them keep calling themselves the elite. But we’re going to call ourselves—and remember you are indeed, you work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them—let’s call ourselves from now on the super-elite. We’re the super-elite.” Mr. CNN continued.. What made Trump’s argument so potent, politically speaking, is that he wasn’t just calling out the elites. He was saying that Average Joes needed to rise up and actually show them how wrong they were — that voting him for him was the best way to express their anger and frustration with the condescension of their alleged bettors. Donald Trump offered himself up as a collective middle finger to the elites. And he won.All of which brings me to the current — seemingly inexplicable — stock surge of GameStop, the video-game seller that has made its money over the years thanks to its locations in malls. So let me get this straight, it’s Donald Trump’s fault for telling people to rise up against the elites that continue to bully them? How so? Is Wall Street finally getting a dose of their own medicine today? It sure as hell seems that way, doesn’t it! So what exactly happened? Well GameStop was about $20 bucks a share on December 28th, on Wednesday it closed at right under $335. How you might ask? Because amateurs had enough of the experts, and did what they told them not to do. That’s called capitalism, right America? Here’s another example of CNN whining about what happened and trying to toss blame on Elon Musk, who’s pro free speech in America. That effort to screw the pros — people with a short position on a stock that is surging have major vulnerabilities the higher the stock goes — got an unexpected boost from none other than iconoclast-in-chief and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tweeted “Gamestonk!” with a link to the “wallstreetbets” subreddit on Tuesday. (Musk has also been a longtime critic of social media censoring and was a prominent Covid-19 skeptic. Sound like anyone else we know?) Isn’t it amazing how when people don’t toe the line, the media and democrats now expect you to be held accountable for not doing what they expected you or wanted you to do? What happened to free speech? What happened to capitalism? What happened to being free in America?"
Laptop Case Twist: FBI Can’t Find It And Some Thinks She Never Had It At All,27 JAN 2021,7747,"Apparently, some people think that the woman accused of stealing Nancy Pelosi’s laptop during the Washington D.C. ‘riot’ never had it all. Buzzfeed News reported: After a long hearing in federal court in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, the case of Riley June Williams — a 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman accused of stealing, or helping to steal, a laptop from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office and sell it to Russia’s foreign intelligence service — is more confusing than ever. According to a statement of facts compiled by the FBI, a “former romantic partner” of Williams called the agency and alleged that Williams took the laptop during the storming of the US Capitol and “intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service.” The FBI added that the tipster said the sale fell through for “unknown reasons” and that Williams either still has the device or destroyed it. (Pelosi’s office has confirmed the laptop is missing, though one of her staffers tweeted two days after the insurrection that it was “only used for presentations.”) But during the hearing Tuesday, the purpose of which was to set the conditions of her house arrest, her defense attorney, federal public defender A.J. Kramer, argued that Williams’ house and her car had been searched, and she did not have the laptop. “In the allegation of the theft of the computer, she’s charged with aiding and abetting, not the actual theft itself,” Kramer said during the hearing. “In fact, [law enforcement] searched everywhere, and she does not have the computer. They searched the car and the house.” Following the hearing, Kramer told BuzzFeed News over the phone that Williams denies all of the accusations made against her — from the theft itself, including aiding or encouraging the theft, to the allegations of attempting to sell it to Russia — and alleged that they were all lies all made up by an ex who, as he said in the hearing, “vowed revenge on Williams for various things.” Williams has filed for a restraining order against that ex, Kramer added. Kramer added that he “thinks” that Williams never had the laptop at all. The Justice Department declined to comment on this suggestion. A screenshot from a YouTube video of the Jan. 6 insurrection, used by the FBI in their investigation of Riley Williams. The FBI affidavit, however, includes screenshots of what appears to be Williams’ account on the social media platform Discord (which was one of the services used to organize the Jan. 6 protests and insurrection), writing, “I STOLE SHIT FROM NANCY POLESI [sic]” and “I DOMT CARE I TOOK NANCY POLESIS HARD DRIVES I DONT CARE KILL ME.” The document also contains several screenshots and descriptions of videos taken during the insurrection, apparently showing Williams in the Capitol, egging on other rioters and apparently directing the crowd up the stairs toward Pelosi’s office. Screenshots of a video that tipsters told the FBI Williams livestreamed on her own social media account show the hands of people in the process of taking a laptop from a congressional desk. The FBI agent writing the affidavit says that the video appears to show Williams telling a man reaching for the computer to “put on gloves” and that writing over the video says “they got the laptop.” The complaint against Williams in the US District Court for the District of Columbia charges Williams on four counts, including aiding and abetting “others to, embezzle, steal, purloin” government property in excess of $6,000, along with the unlawfully entering and disorderly conduct charges that many of the other Capitol rioters have faced. Justice Department lawyer Kelly Smith made it clear that the government was still investigating Williams and that it was possible she could face other charges in the future. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on whether anyone else had been charged in connection with the theft of Pelosi’s laptop, or whether they had retrieved it. The FBI’s statement of facts accuses Williams of attempting to flee ahead of her arrest, deleting her social media accounts, and changing her telephone number. Williams encouraged others to delete messages related to the insurrection as well, the Justice Department said. A day after her arrest warrant was officially issued, however, Williams turned herself in. Judge Zia Faruqui expressed surprise that the government was not advocating for Williams to be detained, since the allegations in the complaint against her were “pretty shocking” and “read like something out of The Americans,” referencing the TV show about Russian spies in the US during the Cold War. Instead of asking for her to be detained, the Justice Department asked that Williams be held under house arrest with an ankle monitor under her mother’s supervision, that she not be allowed to use any device with internet access. Kelly Smith, the attorney representing the Justice Department in the case, refused to elaborate further on why they were not asking for Williams to be detained, saying that providing any more details about the case could jeopardize the government’s investigation into Williams and the events of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Smith pushed Tuesday for a complete ban from the internet, including smartphones and televisions, and asked that Williams be provided a flip phone to speak to her attorney and receive mental health treatment. “Our concern is that going forward the defendant is going to acquire new devices … that are easy to hide, and the harm that can be done can be done instantaneously in the cyber world,” Smith said during the hearing. “Yes, it’s true we don’t have evidence of things she did after her arrest, but she was aware of public media scrutiny of her involvement during the time she was deleting her accounts and instructing other people to delete her account.” Kramer pushed back saying that Williams deleted her accounts before Jan. 6 because her ex, the same one who Williams’ lawyers say tipped off the FBI, was logging into her accounts and messaging people from them. “I don’t agree with the defense’s characterization of when and why she deleted the accounts,” Smith said in response. The government recently acquired evidence that Williams, on Jan. 10, instructed “one of her Discord associates to delete messages, and those messages had to do with the Capitol riot event,” Smith said. This evidence shows that Williams “is a person who is motivated to and knows how to tell people to destroy records,” she added. Faruqui, after Kramer told him about Williams’ allegations against her ex, said without further information from the government’s investigation, he may have to “heavily discount” the allegations made by Williams’ ex, dismissing them as possibly made by someone “with an ax to grind.” “I’ll go by … what you’re saying and I believe these things,” the judge said to Smith, “but I believe Mr. Kramer too. So I’m left to consider whether there’s a megaphone being pointed at her leading her to do bad things on the internet, or one that she has also.” Finally, after two days, around four hours of back and forth, and nearly 30 minutes of off-the-record meetings about whether Williams should be allowed to watch TV if it was connected to the internet, Faruqui ruled: Williams will stay under house arrest with an ankle monitor and the supervision of her mother, will undergo a mental health assessment, and will not be allowed to use the internet unless it is a video call with her lawyer or a mental health professional. She will be allowed to use a flip phone and to watch TV, as long as she doesn’t use the TV to communicate with anyone. Her next hearing is on March 25."
"Biden Orders Female Soldiers To Shower With Men, Little Girls To ‘Bathroom’ With Biological Men",27 JAN 2021,19815,"The rights of women to feel safe in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers have been eliminated by the Biden administration. Many people point out that a man who is on video tape feeling up little girls while their parents are in the room wouldn’t have any qualms about forcing small girls into bathrooms with grown men or ordering female soldiers to shower with their male counterparts. The Federalist reported: The newly inaugurated Biden-Harris administration is off to a rocky start with military men and women. Serious affronts have come from Congress as well as the White House, adding insults to injuries with even more damage on the way. It was bad enough when Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., insinuated during a CNN interview that most of the 25,000 National Guard soldiers deployed to guard the Capitol during the Inauguration were white males and probably Donald Trump voters, so they might be in the “class” of people who “may want to do something” to cause trouble. Then we saw 5,000 troops banished to a cold parking garage with one electrical outlet, no Internet, two restroom stalls, and high risks of COVID. Not since former First Lady Hillary Clinton treated uniformed White House social aides like personal servants have we seen such disdain for military personnel doing their jobs. These affronts and reported plans to keep thousands of troops in Washington, D.C. without a clear mission were exceeded by … Joe Biden signing executive orders on his first day. As predicted, Biden issued an executive order creating special government privileges for gender identity and sexual orientation, a major policy reversal likely to affect the military first. Biden also reversed Trump’s order ending critical race theory (CRT) instruction programs in all government agencies. This means military schools at all levels likely will introduce abrasive CRT programs that accuse non-minorities of “white supremacy” and “systemic racism.” In CRT world, denials of racism prove racism. It is difficult to imagine a more divisive way to demoralize the troops instead of uniting them as an effective, cohesive force. Biden is especially letting down military women, who will be ordered to share their private facilities with biological males who claim to be transgender. Directives issued during the Obama-Biden administration, such as the 2016 “Military Transgender Policy Implementation Handbook,” brushed off concerns about personal discomfort and worse. Women, said the guidebook, will just have to “get used to it.” Eliminating any doubt, Biden’s order explicitly opens doors to sexual minorities who want “access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports” reserved for the opposite sex. Transgender ideology, which demands acceptance of the unscientific notion that gender is “designated” or “assigned at birth,” disregards psychological and biological realities. Science shows that human DNA and chromosomes determine each person’s sex. These characteristics exist long before birth and in every cell of a person’s body. Biological sex does not change with alterations in outward appearance, and abundant scientific research proves that men and women are different in strength, endurance, athletic prowess, and other physical attributes. Activists forget science, however, when it doesn’t suit leftist politics. The Trump Departments of Education and Justice showed respect for women and science by supporting female athletes fighting for the right to compete against other females, not biological males. Under President Biden’s new gender order, this support will end. Ecstatic LGBT activists insist that all government agencies must deny the science of DNA, human genetics, and physiology. Women-only teams at military schools, colleges, and service academies will have to accommodate biological men, regardless of the harm done to women. Military women and athletes deserve respect and fair treatment, but medical issues that detract from deployability and combat readiness are even more important. Consider extensive data published in the 44-page Defense Department report, which justified the 2018 DoD policy regarding transgender people and persons diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The report followed six months of study by a panel of experts, and it cited Military Health System data gathered during the years Obama-Biden transgender policies were in effect. During that time, 994 active-duty servicemembers diagnosed with gender dysphoria accounted for 30,000 mental health visits, and their medical costs increased almost 300 percent. In some commands operational and maintenance funds were diverted to pay for active-duty transgender servicemembers’ extensive travel to obtain specialized medical care. Some units also had to bear high operational costs when individuals preparing for gender transition could live a double life during three to twelve months of “real life experience” (RLE) away from their jobs. In addition, sadly, service members with gender dysphoria were eight times more likely to attempt suicide than service members as a whole (12 percent versus 1.5 percent). Individuals with gender dysphoria deserve compassion and competent psychological care, not politicized medical counselling and treatments. Such mandates disregard medical ethics, which forbid doctors to provide harmful treatments or surgeries that that will not improve and might worsen the patient’s psychological condition. Recent events suggest there will be no “conscience clauses” that respect the deeply held convictions of doctors and nurses, military chaplains, and people of faith. On January 17, President Trump’s Acting Attorney General, John B. Daukas, issued a 22-page memorandum titled “Application of Bostock v. Clayton County.”  It analyzed the Supreme Court’s landmark 2020 Bostock decision, which found that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act bans employment discrimination on grounds of “sexual orientation” or “gender identity.” The ruling, inexplicably written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, did not address other issues, such as housing, education, or the military. Among other things, the Daukas Memorandum maintained that Bostock should not affect constitutional rights of religious liberty. Incoming Biden administration officials pounced. The Daukas Memo was immediately erased from the DoJ website, including Justice Department archives. Behold Orwell’s Ministry of Truth, stuffing wrong-thinking documents right down the memory hole. The Epoch Times explored the issue further: Joe Biden signed an executive order tasking the government with redefining all its policies and regulations regarding discrimination based on sex to include “gender identity,” which would mean men who identify themselves as women can’t be excluded from using all services and amenities reserved for women. The order has been welcomed by activists for transgenderism, but critics argue it erodes protections for women and girls. It remains to be seen how the administration interprets the order in specific cases, but the language indicates that women-only sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms at federally funded institutions will have to be open to biological men who consider themselves female and vice versa. That would include all schools and colleges that accept federal dollars. “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,” the order states. It goes further by infusing “gender identity” into the definition of sex discrimination in housing, workplace, and health care settings. “Adults should be able to earn a living and pursue a vocation knowing that they will not be fired, demoted, or mistreated because of whom they go home to or because how they dress does not conform to sex-based stereotypes,” the order states. “People should be able to access healthcare and secure a roof over their heads without being subjected to sex discrimination.” It orders federal agencies to “review all existing orders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions” that pertain to sex discrimination and make changes or issue new regulations to include gender identity. How exactly the order will play out in practice will depend on how the individual agencies interpret it, in particular, what they will and won’t consider a gender identity. Mostly Fluid In general parlance, people usually understand “gender identity” to refer to men, women, and transgender individuals, as in people who choose to live their lives as the opposite sex due to gender dysphoria, the feeling of extreme discomfort with their biological sex. Yet, the term has evolved into a fluid concept that includes anything one identifies as at a given moment, based on internal feelings. About 2.1 percent of college students identify themselves as transgender, according to the spring 2020 National College Health Assessment survey (pdf). But only some 0.3 percent identify as transgender male-to-female or female-to-male. For the other 1.8 percent, among the most popular gender identities were “Non-binary,” “Genderfluid,” “Genderqueer,” and “My identity is not listed.” Online discussions between individuals who consider themselves one of these new genders indicate that not all of them call themselves transgender. Some of them indicate they are, in fact, comfortable with their bodies. A common theme appears to be that their gender identity is unstable. One day, they may consider themselves women, other days as men, androgynous, or something else altogether. Another common theme is “coming out” to make a statement to the world that they don’t consider themselves to be whatever their biological sex is—to reject to varying degrees the traditional values of biological women playing a feminine role and biological men a masculine one. That statement often takes a political turn along the lines of the quasi-Marxist “critical gender theory,” which reinterprets human history as a struggle between an oppressive “cis-gender heteropatriarchy” and oppressed “gender non-conforming” individuals. With Biden’s order, the gender ideology will to some extent become the official policy of the federal government. The consequences will take time to ascertain, but in some areas, they’re already apparent. Women’s Sports No matter how the regulations shake out, it’s clear the order intends to allow men who identify as women to compete in women’s sports, according to Christiana Holcomb, legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian advocacy group. This policy has already been adopted in Connecticut, with “devastating impact,” she told The Epoch Times in a phone call. In two years, two men who switched their identity to female swept up 15 women’s track championship titles that were previously held by nine girls, she said. “Young women across the state lost out on medals that they earned, advancement opportunities to compete at the next level of competition, and even opportunities to compete in front of college scouts, which as we know could impact a young woman’s scholarship opportunities.” Transgender athletes who undergo sex-change procedures that lower their testosterone levels lose much of the physical advantages of being born male, but research indicates the process takes years and still leaves a number of physical advantages intact. “Once male puberty is complete, testosterone suppression doesn’t undo the biological advantages men possess: larger hearts, lungs and bones, greater bone density, more-oxygenated blood, more fast-twitch muscle fiber, and vastly greater muscle mass,” said Abigail Shrier, journalist and author of “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” in a recent op-ed. And that still leaves out those who skip sex change altogether. In one case in Connecticut, a track athlete competed for several years as male before taking only several weeks to switch to competing as a female, immediately scoring two championship wins with record times. The debate around transgender athletes has become polarized to the point where many assume transgender athletes are intentionally cheating their way to trophies, while others assume that people opposing the inclusion of transgender athletes are doing so out of hate. Transgender individuals say that being perceived as their preferred gender improves their well-being. Surveys show that about 30 percent of youth identifying as transgender attempt suicide (pdf). Those who don’t face bullying or feel discriminated against seem to have a significantly lower, though still high, suicide attempt rate. Regardless of the sincerity of the athletes about their professed gender, those born male have an unfair advantage, according to Holcomb. “Frankly, it’s unlawful,” she said, arguing it violates Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which guarantees equal opportunity in education. The U.S. Department of Education reached the same conclusion in a May 15, 2020, letter saying the Connecticut policy violates girl athletes’ civil rights. This position is one of those likely on the chopping block due to Biden’s order. Bathrooms, Locker Rooms, and Beyond The order’s mention of bathroom and locker room access reinvigorates concerns over privacy, and even safety, for youth. “We have separate spaces for privacy for a reason and school districts have a duty to protect the privacy and the dignity of young women, and that’s completely violated when a biological male is allowed and is given full authorization to access these private spaces,” Holcomb said. Critics also argue that “inclusive” bathroom and locker room policies encourage criminals to harass women by pretending to be transgender. Incidents underscoring this concern have been reported by the media in recent years (pdf). “The Biden administration’s order is very broad and will touch not just public schools but also employment, potentially even women’s homeless shelters, and safe spaces from domestic abuse,” Holcomb said. Alito’s Warning Biden’s order draws on last year’s Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that the ban on discrimination based on sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also covers sexual orientation or gender identity. The decision came as a surprise to many conservatives as it was penned by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2017 and was generally expected to interpret the law as written. Yet, the opinion equaled a “judicial dictate” of “judges latching on to a novel form of living literalism to rewrite ordinary meaning and remake American law,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump nominee, noted in a dissent. The decision was explicitly limited to the employment setting and shouldn’t be interpreted to apply in any way to women’s sports, Holcomb said. But Justice Samuel Alito, in his own dissent, warned that the decision would open the door to inserting sexual orientation and gender identity into legislation banning sex discrimination across the board. “Under the Court’s decision … transgender persons will be able to argue that they are entitled to use a bathroom or locker room that is reserved for persons of the sex with which they identify, and while the Court does not define what it means by a transgender person, the term may apply to individuals who are ‘gender fluid,’ that is, individuals whose gender identity is mixed or changes over time,” he said. “Thus, a person who has not undertaken any physical transitioning may claim the right to use the bathroom or locker room assigned to the sex with which the individual identifies at that particular time. The Court provides no clue why a transgender person’s claim to such bathroom or locker room access might not succeed.” He noted that “for women who have been victimized by sexual assault or abuse, the experience of seeing an unclothed person with the anatomy of a male in a confined and sensitive location such as a bathroom or locker room can cause serious psychological harm.” This interpretation of sex discrimination would also intrude on the prerogative for religious institutions to hire employees who “live the faith,” as they’d be compelled by law to “employ individuals whose conduct flouts the tenets of the organization’s faith,” forcing the group “to communicate an objectionable message,” Alito said. The issue is “perhaps the most acute” for hiring teachers, he said. “If a religious school teaches that sex outside marriage and sex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message may be lost if the school employs a teacher who is in a same-sex relationship or has undergone or is undergoing sex reassignment.” The Biden administration seems to be following Alito’s predictions, saying that “under Bostock’s reasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 … the Fair Housing Act, … and section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, … along with their respective implementing regulations—prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.” Legal Reasoning The Bostock decision makes a core argument that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity “necessarily and intentionally applies sex-based rules.” In the case of a homosexual employee, “if the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague,” Gorsuch said. In the case of a transgender employee, “if the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth,” the justice said. But is it that a biological man who at some point in life starts to identify as a woman exhibits the same “traits or actions” as a biological woman and that a homosexual’s attraction to another man manifests in the same “traits or actions” as a man’s attraction to a woman? At least in the eyes of the employer, no, Alito’s reasoning indicates. “These two employees are not materially identical in every respect but sex,” he said. “On the contrary, they differ in another way that the employer thinks is quite material. And … this is a view that an employer is permitted to implement.” While sympathetic to the motivation of his colleagues, Kavanaugh argued the court had no business to de facto erase what he described as a well-settled and understood distinction. “The majority opinion insists that it is not rewriting or updating Title VII, but instead is just humbly reading the text of the statute as written. But that assertion is tough to accept,” he said. “Most everyone familiar with the use of the English language in America understands that the ordinary meaning of sexual orientation discrimination is distinct from the ordinary meaning of sex discrimination. Federal law distinguishes the two. State law distinguishes the two. This Court’s cases distinguish the two. Statistics on discrimination distinguish the two. History distinguishes the two. Psychology distinguishes the two. Sociology distinguishes the two. Human resources departments all over America distinguish the two. Sports leagues distinguish the two. Political groups distinguish the two. Advocacy groups distinguish the two. Common parlance distinguishes the two. Common sense distinguishes the two.” In his conclusion, the justice predicted that “the implications of this Court’s usurpation of the legislative process will likely reverberate in unpredictable ways for years to come.”"
GA Rep. Removed From Chamber After Refusing COVID ‘Test’,27 JAN 2021,2480,"If more evidence is needed that the ruling elite will not do anything to protect individual rights is needed, take a look at what just happened in Georgia. WSBTV reported:         A Georgia House of Representatives member was removed from the chamber at the State Capitol after he refused to take a COVID-19 test. House Speaker David Ralston interrupted Tuesday morning’s session to call out an unnamed house member for refusing to get the required twice a week COVID-19 test. While he didn’t mention the Gwinnett County lawmaker by name, Ralston ordered Rep. David Clark (R-Buford) out of the chamber. When he didn’t leave, the speaker took drastic action and had a state trooper escort Clark out. “Any public safety officer, member of the Georgia state patrol is authorized under Rule Four of the House to escort the member of the chamber,” he said. Clark spoke with Channel 2′s Richard Elliot after he was removed. “You can’t just pick the rules and decide who comes in and who doesn’t come in,” Clark said. “It’s called Speaker Ralston being a dictator again. I’ve read the rules. I’ve been over them.” Clark, a long outspoken Ralston critic, defended his decision not to get tested by claiming he wants others to get tested first. “You cannot come in and tell me I have to have a COVID-19 test when no first responders, no doctors, no teachers, two teachers just died in Cobb, you know. Do they get to test? No, so why are we getting them? … Both sides of the political aisle issued statements or tweets in support of Ralston’s move. Ralston himself said he is worried about the health of his fellow lawmakers. “I don’t know about y’all, but I’ve been to too many funerals and I’m getting tired of going to them,” he said. (Wait… aren’t funerals gatherings that have been banned?) House members are required to be tested for COVID-19 twice a week, which was put in place before the legislative session started earlier this month. House Majority Leader Jon Burns (R-Newington) and House Minority Leader James Beverly (D-Macon) issued the following joint statement. “We strongly support Speaker David Ralston in his efforts to preserve and protect the health and safety of the members and staff of the House of Representatives and all those who enter the doors of the Georgia State Capitol. We agree that all Members of the House of Representatives should comply with the testing procedures that have been implemented for their safety and the safety of their fellow Georgians.”"
Texas Gets Court Victory Over Biden’s Deportation Freeze,27 JAN 2021,3431,"It took only six days for Texas to stop the Biden plan to halt deportations. The Epoch Times reported: A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked an executive order issued by Joe Biden to halt the deportation of certain immigrants for 100 days. U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, issued a temporary restraining order on Jan. 26, blocking Biden’s policy nationwide for 14 days after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenged it in court. The order is a setback to the Biden administration, which has proposed far-reaching changes, including a plan to legalize about 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States illegally. Last week, the administration also issued an order that halts all U.S.–Mexico border wall construction. During former President Donald Trump’s four years in office, Democrats and immigration activists often filed lawsuits in an attempt to halt Trump’s border wall construction, among other immigration provisions. With Paxton’s lawsuit, it’s likely that Republicans may do the same—especially with hundreds of judges appointed by Trump during his term in office. Paxton hailed the victory, saying on Twitter, “Texas is the FIRST state in the nation to bring a lawsuit against the Biden Admin. AND WE WON.” “Within 6 days of Biden’s inauguration, Texas has HALTED his illegal deportation freeze. *This* was a seditious left-wing insurrection,” the Republican said. “And my team and I stopped it. David Pekoske, acting Homeland Security secretary, issued a directive on Jan. 20 directing authorities to focus on national security and public safety threats as well as anyone who was taken into custody after entering the U.S. illegally after Nov. 1. White House officials didn’t immediately respond to a request by The Epoch Times for comment. The Biden administration argued in court that Paxton’s lawsuit is unenforceable because “an outgoing administration cannot contract away that power for an incoming administration.” Pekoske had said the deportation freeze would allow the DHS to “ensure that its resources are dedicated to responding to the most pressing challenges that the United States faces.” That includes the “immediate operational challenges at the southwest border in the midst of the most serious global public health crisis in a century,” he said. “Throughout this interim period, DHS will continue to enforce our immigration laws.” But last week, Paxton, a Republican, said the DHS failed to consult with Texas before making its immigration policy changes, as is required per an agreement between Texas and the agency. “Border states like Texas pay a particularly high price when the federal government fails to faithfully execute our country’s immigration laws,” Paxton said last week, adding that an “attempted halt on almost all deportations would increase the cost to Texas caused by illegal immigration.” Like Paxton, several former Trump DHS officials expressed alarm in recent days over Biden’s orders to rescind some immigration rules. “With the stroke of a pen, President Biden made this country less safe,” former U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan told Breitbart News on Jan. 23. “It’s pure politics over public safety.” Separately, a Democratic member of Congress confirmed that border wall construction along the U.S.–Mexico border was to be halted on Jan. 26, per one of Biden’s orders."
"Wow! Israeli Creates Nasal Spray That Kills 99.9% Of COVID, Infection Reduced 95% Within 1 Day!",26 JAN 2021,5091,"A new medical breakthrough has eliminated the need to take the deadly mRNA COVID vaccine. Jewish News reported: The Israeli co-founder of a nasal spray that kills 99.9% of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, has told Jewish News that she believes the spray will be a game changer in the fight against Covid-19. Dr Gilly Regev, who co-founded SaNOtize Research and Development Corp. based in Vancouver, Canada explained via telephone that “If you use it daily, I really believe you won’t be affected by Covid-19. We have shown in the clinical trials that the people who used it did not get infected.” The first UK clinical trials for The SaNOtize Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray (NONS) begins this week. The treatment, developed by SaNOtize Research and Development Corp. based in Vancouver, Canada, co-founded by Israeli Gilly Regev, proved 99.9% effective in killing the coronavirus in independent lab tests at Utah State University’s Antiviral Research Institute. NONS is designed to kill the virus in the upper airways, preventing it from incubating and spreading to the lungs. Additional studies in rodents with COVID-19 infection showed over 95% reduction within the first day after infection. It is currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials throughout Canada approved by Health Canada, and in other countries. “We have shown in animals that we can reduce the virus in the nose so I think we have all the science and the data to support this in humans,” says Regev. Though this is the first trial they have done for early treatment, she is confident that it will prove its efficacy on humans. Lab tests on the SaNOtize treatment at Utah State University’s Antiviral Research Institute confirmed that the company’s Nitric Oxide Releasing Solution inactivated more than 99.9% of SARs-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, within two minutes. The SaNOtize treatment is based on nitric oxide, a natural nanomolecule produced by the human body with proven anti-microbial properties shown to have a direct effect on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The treatment can be delivered by nasal spray, throat gargle or nasal lavage. NONS which Regev describes as “a super simple nasal spray” is unique in that it not only creates a preventative barrier but also kills the virus too. “We call it ‘the hand sanitiser for the nose’ because the idea is everyone will carry it in their pocket like they carry a hand sanitizer today and so prevent people getting infected so we can get out of this!” she explains. Another reason Regev is so “confident of its efficacy” is because pre-Covid, it was being used to treat other diseases such as acne, athlete’s foot and even the flu. “I have always used the spray before and after getting on the plane to prevent getting the flu.” she adds. Born and raised in Israel, Dr Gilly Regev completed a PhD in Biochemistry at the Hebrew University before moving to Canada 16 years ago. While in Canada, she met her business partner, Dr Chris Miller, who introduced her to “the crazy world of nitric oxide.” Not only was this an area of science Regev found “fascinating” but it also meant that she “could do some good in the world and help people.” For Regev, that is the ultimate goal. She hopes that after the trial, the spray will be available to purchase over the counter by anyone “as there is no risk”. “It will be pretty inexpensive”, Regev adds, “because our goal is that everyone can use it and so eventually, we can get it to some of the third world countries and be able to help with the spread of the disease there.” She says they are already doing work in countries like Malaysia, “to help those that cannot afford vaccines or some of the more expensive treatment.” Regev notes that Israel is already looking to approve the spray as a medical device, where “we already have a lot of interest,” she adds. She says that so far, none of the 200 people that have trialled the spray, have shown any side effects. “It’s amazing how much a small molecule can do!” Rob Wilson, a former British government minister who represents SaNOtize in the UK and EU, is overseeing the trial. “If, as we expect, the current Phase II results in Canada confirm the very encouraging results received from the Antiviral Research Institute and ongoing studies at Colorado State University SaNOtize will be seeking emergency approval in Canada to proceed directly to Phase IV introduction of the product to the market as part of the continuing global fight against this deadly pandemic,” said Wilson. “Any intervention for treating coronavirus – the virus responsible for Covid-19 – is to be welcomed. The fact that a relatively easy and simple nasal spray could be an effective treatment is welcome news and offers a significant advance in our therapeutic armoury against this devastating disease. Ashford and St Peters Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is proud to be at the forefront of trialling this intervention,” said Pankaj Sharma MD PhD FRCP, Professor of Neurology and Director of the Institute of Cardiovascular Research at Royal Holloway, University of London."
"Biden Costs Thousands Of Union Jobs With Energy Acts, Tribe Claims “Violation”",25 JAN 2021,6604,"The Biden administration seems bent on turning Americans into poverty stricken slaves, while simultaneously enriching China. But, many experts warn this is exactly his administration’s plan. His drilling pause, in addition to putting tens of thousands of union workers out of work, according to a Native American tribe, actually “violates” their agreement with the United States, as well. The Epoch Times reported: A Native American tribe called on the Biden administration to “immediately amend” a White House executive order “to provide an exception for energy permits and approvals on Indian lands.” “The Ute Indian Tribe and other energy-producing tribes rely on energy development to fund our governments and provide services to our members,” the Ute Indian Tribe said in a letter to Acting Secretary of the Interior Scott de la Vega last week. “Your order is a direct attack on our economy, sovereignty, and our right to self-determination. Indian lands are not federal public lands. “Any action on our lands and interests can only be taken after effective tribal consultation.” One of Biden’s orders requires the agency to “conduct a review of the monument boundaries and conditions of the Grand Staircase-Escalante, Bears Ears, Northeast Canyons, and Seamounts Marine National Monuments” and will be done “in consultation with other agencies and Tribal governments, to determine whether restoration of the monument boundaries and conditions would be appropriate,” according to a statement from the Interior Department on Jan. 21, The Epoch Times has reached out to the agency for comment. The Ute tribal lands produce about 45,000 barrels of crude oil per day in the Uintah Basin, along with about 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, according to a document the tribe filed with the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 2017, Reuters reported. The tribe added that the order was issued “in violation [of] our government-to-government relationship,” as well as of previous federal directives about coordinating with Native American tribal governments. The Jan. 20 executive order suspended the authority of Interior Department offices to issue new fossil fuel permits and leases—a move that could be a first step in delivering on Biden’s campaign promise to ban all new federal drilling permits. “The Order does not impact existing ongoing operations under valid leases and does not preclude the issuance of leases, permits, and other authorizations by those specified. In addition, any actions necessary in the event of an incident that might pose a threat to human health, welfare, or safety will continue,” the Interior Department said in the statement. Other Native American tribes—including the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation in North Dakota—are also big producers of oil and gas and might push back against the order. Some GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, said the move to suspend oil and natural gas drilling will imperil tens of thousands of American jobs and raise energy prices for U.S. families. Meanwhile, these moves mean that China will reap the benefits while American workers starve. The Epoch Times reported: Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) criticized President Joe Biden’s revocation of the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, saying the oil that would have traveled through the pipeline will go to China or another country or be shipped to the United States by rail, which Rounds said is less safe. “Look, they’re going to pump the oil, and it’s going to go someplace. It’s too valuable not to, and we still need the oil. So, it’s either going to be shipped to other countries, including China, which has not the same type of environmental regulations that we have when it comes to the processing of that oil, or it could come back down into the United States to the specific locations where they actually know how to process it, to actually do that crude oil,” Rounds told Fox News in an interview aired on Jan. 23. “This was the most efficient way to do it. It’s still going to get moved, but now they’re probably going to have to go to rail cars, and when you go to rail cars, it’s not as safe. And so, this was simply the most efficient way to move about 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day, that now will probably go either by rail or it’ll go to another country.” Rounds said the decision will divert a lot of the oil onto rail cars, displacing grain shipments from his state. He also lamented the loss of 10,000 future jobs, including 2,000 Americans who were on the job when Biden signed the executive order gutting the project. Keystone XL is the fourth phase of construction of the Keystone pipeline, which adds a branch connecting terminals in Hardisty, Alberta, and Steele City, Nebraska, through a shorter route using a larger diameter pipe. It has drawn attention since environmentalists singled out the project as a symbol of the fight against fossil fuels and for natural preservation. After President Barack Obama temporarily delayed the project in 2015, President Donald Trump issued a presidential permit in 2017 to allow the project to go forward. Biden revoked Trump’s order on Jan. 20. TC Energy Corp. is planning to eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs related to the halt of the pipeline expansion project. According to the Association of Oil Pipe Lines’ CEO Andy Black, the move is tantamount to “killing 10,000 jobs and taking $2.2 billion in payroll out of workers’ pockets [and] is not what Americans need or want right now.” “I don’t work for you” – @JoeBiden It’s becoming clearer every day who “the great unifier” does and does not work for. #BidenAdministration #Biden pic.twitter.com/jc9JxUqR5S — David Webb (@davidwebbshow) January 23, 2021 BREAKING: Union leaders have been calling Biden like crazy ‘Wall, pipelines, gas, coal, etc..all of these work sites are closing on a daily basis thanks to his EO's…they're being told to call back in a few weeks, some calls aren't even answered,’ says WH official — Jack Posobiec  (@JackPosobiec) January 24, 2021 New Mexico voted for Biden so they are getting what they signed up for.

Great Reset: Slavery Coming To U.S. Courtesy Of The US Federal Reserve,25 JAN 2021,14402,"Maybe you have heard the term the Great Reset… but maybe you aren’t actually sure what that means for you and your family. Breitbart News has explained that it is here… and it means slavery for the American people: Here’s a December 15 headline in the New York Times that should not have been lost in the holiday whirl, nor in the general hubbub of news since: “Fed Joins Climate Network, to Applause From the Left.” As the article details, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the nation’s central bank, has officially joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). That’s “Greening,” as in “environmentalism,” “Greta Thunberg,” “Green New Deal,” and all that. And as the Times makes clear in its headline, the left is loving it. NGFS is an organization that few Americans have heard of, and yet it’s potentially one of the most powerful entities on the planet: Its roster of members and observers is nearly 100, including such mighties as the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. And now, the U.S. Federal Reserve. So we can see that just about all the money in the world passes through its institutions. That’s power. It’s interesting to note that in the past, the left has been mostly hostile to big financial institutions, seeing them as pillars of Capital. And yet nowadays, the left—at least its huge green faction—is cheering for the financiers. Why this turnabout? Because NGFS is an institution that the green left can control, and thus guide, in its pursuit of “sustainability”—that being the favored buzzword of the ecologically woke. As NGFS says of itself, its mission is to “contribute to the development of environment and climate risk management in the financial sector to mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy.” So now we’re starting to get the picture: NGFS is the global fusion of Big Green and Big Money, also known as Woke Capital. And yes, it’s that same Woke Capital that’s been leading the push for “The Great Reset”—the wholesale remaking of national and international societies and economies, all in accordance with the politically correct vision of Klaus Schwab and his plutocratic pals at the World Economic Forum—which Virgil, and many others here at Breitbart News, have heartily critiqued. In the meantime, conservatives, populists, and sovereigntists—those who believe that the U.S. should retain sovereignty over its own affairs—have been viewing these developments with alarm. Indeed, it’s been pressure from the right that kept the Fed from joining NGFS much earlier. As the Times explains, the Fed’s formal membership in NGFS “is something that Democratic lawmakers have been pushing for and that Republicans have eyed warily.” And yet now that Joe Biden is in the White House, pledged to the green agenda, the Fed will feel all the more emboldened to do exactly as the New York Times wishes. Fortunately, alert Republicans are on watch: The watch-leader is Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, who told the Times of his fears that the Fed and NGFS would crimp, even cripple, American business through the “backdoor” of financial regulation. “I’m going to be raising this issue much more vociferously,” Barr said, adding, “I think my colleagues will as well.” Indeed, Barr helped organize a joint letter of protest, in which a total of 47 House Republicans wrote to Fed chairman Jerome Powell on December 9, warning against “politically motivated and public relations-focused decisions to limit credit availability to [politically disfavored] industries.” (Of course, since their loss in 2018, House Republicans are now in the minority; if the majority House Democrats all stick together, House Republicans can be mostly ignored. And that’s a hard reminder, to those who see themselves as being above voting: Elections, including the ’18 midterms that cost the GOP its majority, do, in fact, have big consequences.) Meanwhile, the U.S. Fed has the power to choke off bank financing for any business, or even for a whole industry; that is, if the Fed declares something to be a “systemic credit risk,” lenders will shy away, lest they be labeled as violating their fiduciary responsibilities. In this fashion, the Fed could build a blockade against industries despised by the greens, including oil and natural gas, mining, and manufacturing.  As Barr and his allies wrote in their letter, “The enormous power of the Fed should not be weaponized to discriminate against a wide swath of American industry.” Of course, such discrimination is exactly what NGFS—now including the Fed—has in mind: to use the power of discriminatory finance to force industries, companies, and people to go green. Either that, or cease to exist altogether. Virgil should note that NGFS has plenty of friends in high places, including in the private sector, all eager to help in this mandatory greening. One such friend is Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the Manhattan-based financial colossus—assets under management: $7.8 trillion—that has, for years, been pushing a top-down liberal green agenda. Under a December 17 headline, “Larry Fink’s BlackRock Doubles Down on Woke Capitalism,” Breitbart News’s John Carney reported on Fink’s latest letter to investors, which declares, “Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects … awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.” We can see immediately that Fink’s “Fundamental Reshape” is little different from a “Great Reset.” Indeed, BlackRock’s $7.4 trillion represents about a fifth of the value of the U.S. stock market, and so its power to force investment decisions is without question. Moreover, BlackRock is being joined in its green power-playing by the likes of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and all the rest of the top banks and investment houses—not to mention super-financiers led by George Soros—and so just about anything is possible. Thus it’s likely that we’ll see the impact of this Woke Capital SWAT team in the years to come, as NGFS, plus the World Economic Forum—plus BlackRock and all the other Wokesters running billion-, even trillion-dollar outfits—put the green hammer down on politically incorrect sectors. All this is bad news for, most immediately, American coal. As an aside, we might note that, yes, it’s a bit strange that China is still building new coal plants, while global greens look the other way; greens prefer, instead, to focus on un-employing the last West Virginia coal miner, while accepting China’s promise to fix everything by 2060. Yes, that’s the scenario that China puts forward: Let us do whatever we want now, and four decades in the future, everything will be fine. And the greens are eating it up. The Hidden Green Hand We Americans might ask ourselves: How did we get here? How did we get to the point that control of our lives belongs to institutions—the Fed, NGFS, BlackRock, etc.—that few citizens know about, and that none ever voted for? And how, even if we are properly informed, could we reclaim power over our own destiny? Yes, those are interesting questions—which Joe Biden has never had to answer. During his campaign, Biden was happy to keep quiet about matters of Woke Capital, because even Democrats know that it’s never a popular-vote getter to say that you’re looking forward to turning over control of the American economy to a shadowy foreign body such as NGFS. To be sure, Biden has been happy to talk, in suitably vague terms, about his plans for greening the economy, and yet the message was always that Americans would do this, because it was good for America and for the world.  Meanwhile, the lurking reality—that the world would be dictating to America, without much regard for American jobs or prosperity—was never in Biden’s vocabulary. Indeed, Biden was able to “stealth” the green’s true agenda, and now, in the first days of the 46th presidency, here we are: The Fed is in NGFS, and so Fed chair Powell will soon be working with the world’s central banks, joined by Fink of BlackRock, et al., to chart out our future. Who elected them? Nobody, of course—and yet the Biden administration will be happy to give the unelected globalists the whip. In the meantime, a look at NGFS’s Twitter feed these past few weeks shows that it has been busy working with central banks and companies around the world to assure “green sustainability” in all economic activities. In fact, BlackRock has managed to insinuate two of its executives into senior economic jobs in the Biden administration, one running the White House National Economic Council, and the other moving in as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department. So what comes next? What will happen in 2021? An early straw in the wind came on January 16, when Breitbart News reported that global greens associated with the United Nations Environmental Programme say that the price of the U.S. reentering the Paris Climate Framework (the one negotiated by Barack Obama in 2015, and from which Donald Trump withdrew in 2017) will be $50 billion a year, minimum, and perhaps as much as $500 billion a year. If so, that will be an example of the sort of payments that Uncle Sam is making, even as the Biden administration says, “Hey, don’t look at us—it’s the U.N.!” Furthermore, we can assume that American coal mines will be goners, as the Fed joins, most obviously, with the Biden Environmental Protection Agency to shut them all down. Then the next target will likely be the oil and gas companies, starting with the biggest, Exxon. The greens can’t shut Exxon and Big Oil and Gas down right away, of course, lest the economy come to a literal standstill. (And Republican strength in the 2020 elections convinced Democrats that they have to be careful.) Instead, the Democrats will stand by as the Fed and NGFS begin a slow squeeze, screwing down on the energy companies’ access to credit and capital—which will in turn hurt their ability to finance their operations and depress their stock prices, thereby leaving them even more vulnerable to financial pressures. The key, as far as NGFS and its allies are concerned, is to be indirect, so as not to rile up the Deplorables if they can help it. As globalist Ian Bremmer, head of the Eurasia Group, wrote on January 4, “Policy will have to come through executive action, given resolute Republican opposition in Congress, but there is still much the administration can do, from new methane pollution rules to fuel efficiency standards and the integration of climate considerations into financial regulation.” Thus we can see: Bremmer and his allies want to put as little as possible before actual voters, preferring hidden-hand rulemaking by distant bureaucracies. Following this sneaky playbook, the Fed will simply declare that Exxon and the others are credit risks, and that ruling will keep the banks away, lest they be accused of violating their fiduciary duties—a serious legal charge in the finance world. And if the banks shrink away, the capital markets, too, will back off. As a result, gasoline could get a bit scarce, and maybe the price of a gallon will go up a dollar or two. Consumers at the pump will become angry, of course, but will they figure out the cause? Perhaps not: Perhaps they’ll blame “Big Oil,” or “middlemen,” or “OPEC.” In other words, it’s possible that consumers will fail to figure out the true reason for the shortages and price increases. Of course, some figures, such as Kentucky’s Andy Barr, can be counted on to point out the true cause of the coming gas crisis—and yet will smart voices be heard above the din of demagoguery? Can we count on the Main Stream Media to explain the facts and the causes of the problem? But okay, let’s suppose that the three-way choking of Exxon—as the hands of the Fed, NGFS, and BlackRock wrap around the company’s throat—were to become a salient political issue. What then? It’s a safe bet that the Biden administration would say that there’s nothing it can do. Bidenites will say that the “free market,” informed, of course, by dire environmental reality, is simply passing a harsh verdict on Exxon. That is, world capitalism has decided that oil is so dangerous and catastrophic that it must be shunned. Whereupon all the titans of finance would say, “The president is correct, Exxon is a bad investment!” (And yes, there’ll be lots of winks all around, as the top players hope that the masses never wise up to their green game-playing.) Such a shape-shifting stance, of course, would save Democratic lawmakers in Congress the trouble—and the risk—of taking responsibility for any of these changes, to say nothing of actually voting for them. That is, the Democrats will be able to say, “Don’t look at us! We didn’t vote for any of this! These decisions are being made by international organizations, and international law, way above our pay grade!” Yes, politicians in a potentially dicey situation—irate voters! pitch forks!—are always happy to pass the buck to someone else. The more nameless and faceless, the better. And NGFS fits that description to a tee. Under such a scenario, would the Republican opposition be able to explain a path forward? A path that would save the American economy from being greened into a palsy? Or a coma? Would Republicans—perhaps joined by a few Democrats, such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin—be able to articulate a way to get the Fed out of NGFS, out of the Paris Climate Agreement (that being the carbon-reduction deal that Barack Obama put us in, that Donald Trump took us out of, and that Biden plans to put us back into), and out of whatever other obscure regulatory restrictions, national and international, that the Biden administration has imposed? We’ve learned that once the U.S. enters into an international agreement, it’s hard to exit; heck, the U.S. can’t even get out of Afghanistan. Back to NGFS: The U.S. is now in. Do Americans understand what that entry will mean for their future? And if they ever were to gain understanding, could the U.S. ever find the will, or the way, to extricate itself from NGFS? Or will the green financiers keep this country in their grip forever? As of now, we don’t know the answers. All we know is that the struggle to maintain American sovereignty now has a new flashpoint: NGFS."
"Biden Doesn’t Salute Marines, Just Repeats Controller’s Instruction, Kamala Forced To “Wave” Him Back",22 JAN 2021,2704,"Yet again, the cognitive decline and hypocrisy of Joe Biden is now on full display and many people argue he’s a puppet, being told what to do every minute of every day. Not only did he not salute Marines at his ‘inauguration,’ he also had to be waved back into reality by Kamala later. https://youtu.be/21BU0YK0cO4 https://twitter.com/JimboGoestoDC/status/1351932275097743366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw The Gateway Pundit reported: Joe Biden went to church on Wednesday morning and appeared to not really know where he was at.

Biden and incoming first lady Jill Biden on Wednesday are attending a service at Washington’s Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle. With them are incoming Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff. At Biden’s invitation, the first couple is joined by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, including all four top-ranking members of congressional leadership. After slowly walking up the church steps, Biden looked lost.  He looked around at the top of the stairs as if wondering where he was at.  Kamala Harris waved at him as if to say, ‘Joe we are here’.  Next he turned for pictures to a non-existent crowd.  Only a few politicians were present along with media and some marines.  Next Biden turned and walked into the church holding his wife’s arm showing his need to have her lead him around.  When he entered the church he forgot to (or intentionally didn’t) salute the Marines: Before entering the church some believe he said to himself, “Salute the Marines”.  This was as if he was hearing someone speak to him through an earpiece.   He may have also said “Good Looking Marines”.  Either way he didn’t salute the marines: Sources have revealed that Biden wears an earpiece to get prompts from staff, but I’ve always been skeptical. But here we see Biden getting an instruction over his earpiece and instead of following them he repeats them. “Salute Marines.” pic.twitter.com/MpvAYU7hEi — @amuse (@amuse) January 21, 2021 This is not the first time Biden was accused of using an earpiece. There was rumblings Biden wore an earpiece during the debates. Biden was also accused of wearing an earpiece during a town hall in the fall: Clearly Biden’s health has been in question for the past few years.  It’s as if he was propped up so the Democrats and their allies could steal the election not caring who the candidate was.  The media hid his obvious mental deterioration from the US public. This guy is totally lost."
Biden’s 10 Executive Orders That Fully Weaponize COVID Against Citizens,22 JAN 2021,11330,"Joe Biden (or more accurately, his controllers) have done more damage in the first day of office than many democrats have done in years. He has fully weaponized COVID against the American citizen and our freedoms. Conservative treehouse explained: One of the bigger issues never fully grasped by many Americans was President Donald Trump’s restraint in relation to the power of the federal government under the guise of COVID-19 action.  No president in our lifetime was ever more reluctant to weaponize the opportunity to expand government; Donald Trump stood the gap. CTH warned since last summer of the ramifications if a leftist group used COVID-19 to expand federal power over peoples lives and livelihoods.  Today, JoeBama’s team has unleashed a series of TEN EXECUTIVE ORDERS fully weaponizing the opportunity. (1) Executive order on COVID worker Safety, weaponized Dept of Labor, OSHA.  Literally word-for-word what CTH predicted.   [Predictions HERE and HERE] (2) Executive order on COVID school safety, weaponized the Dept of Education. Leverages federal funds, grants.  Supports the education labor union effort. Exactly as expected. (3) Executive order creating COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force.  Weaponizing the HHS takeover; the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Education, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Again, exactly as predicted. (4) Executive order using National Health Crisis as a security threat.  Weaponizing the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security. (5) Executive order taking over National Guard.  The domestic terrorists need a category within the health emergency.  The isolation and detainment camps need security. “Support of Operations or Missions to Prevent and Respond to the Spread of COVID-19. (a) The Secretary of Defense shall, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with mission requirements (including geographic proximity), request pursuant to 32 U.S.C. 502(f) that all State and territorial governors order National Guard forces to perform duty to fulfill mission assignments.” (6) Executive order taking control of travel.  “The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Secretary of Transportation (including through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)), the Secretary of Homeland Security (including through the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard). You can read the rest HERE. Here’s the earlier warning: There is a COVID-19 virus; however, COVID is not more dangerous than all other flu-like viruses that impact the respiratory system. COVID-19 is very manageable and doesn’t carry a higher fatality rate.  [Usefulness As A Narrative] Why is COVID-19 being disproportionately hyped as such a dangerous threat, when the reality of the statistical danger is much less than the intense level of hype?… That is the key question. The answer is… social changes under the guise of COVID-19 mitigation, are the entry point for the goals and aspirations of the political left on a national and global scale. COVID-19 is a virus, but also a very important political weapon, and we are about to discover exactly what the purpose of the hype is all about. What follows will help understand; and when you encounter the fear it will help to reconcile what people cannot figure out. Joe Biden is an avatar; a political pawn; a cognitively declining guy who has no idea what is happening around him. The people behind the Biden campaign, those in real control of what this is about, have not hidden their goals and aspirations. These are not stupid people. They are scheming, conniving, ever-planning, ever-manipulating & Machiavellian types within the political system; lusting for power, influence and affluence. What they are planning to do is weaponize COVID-19 to attain ideological objectives. This is why they hyped the fear within it for almost a year. Nothing within their plan requires the approval or consent of any representative body in Washington DC. COVID is the tool to “fundamentally change” the way the United States exists. On October 23rd, those behind the Biden campaign dropped all pretense, openly having their candidate state publicly his intention to control the lives of all Americans using the authority of a weaponized federal government to advance national COVID-19 regulations. As you watch this video from Biden’s campaign it is important to remember state government officials have already moved to define “essential businesses” and “essential workers” during the forced shut-downs. That is going to become a bigger issue downstream; however, for now just watch closely what Joe Biden is saying here: The Dept of Transportation would be the agency enforcing a national interstate transit mask requirement. However, don’t focus on the DoT part of what he was saying… that’s only one creek… Instead focus on the downstream use of all federal regulatory agencies and how they align within a Federal COVID compliance network… that’s the river. Think about the Dept of Agriculture (SNAP/food stamps), the Dept. of Labor, the Dept of Education, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Dept of Labor, Dept of Energy and how they would join with the DoT to create the aggregate raging river of regulation. Think about the federal government using mandates for enforced national COVID-19 compliance rules. Think about USDA (Dept of Agriculture) and OSHA federal inspections for social distancing (etc) in all businesses, not just restaurants. Think about the COVID-19 regulatory and compliance system and what political beneficiaries stand to gain. Think about the Dept of Education using COVID to restructure the way education is taught and the downstream regulations on charter schools and non-compliant educational systems that do not meet the ideological objectives of the master control plan. Think about how the Dept. of Labor (complaint division) can be weaponized against political opposition based on arbitrary inspections under the guise of employee health and safety…. using federal COVID compliance rules. Think about required days off for the entire employee base if a single infection is identified in the workplace. Paid days off…. funded by Federal Government. Think about how that changes the income dependency dynamic. Think about the larger Green New Deal (goals and objectives), and then contrast those objectives while aligning an overlay map of how federal COVID mitigation rules can be applied as a back door to the EXACT SAME objective. Far beyond masks…. Workspaces being forced to be redesigned. New rules on labor density. New rules on labor/manufacturing and office proximity. New rules on uniforms. New rules on hand-washing stations. New rules on sick pay, shift hours, time-off when a COVID infection is detected in the workplace. Think about everything from rules on surfaces, to rules on packaging, to rules on ALL business operations as an outcome of federal regulatory policy under the guise of CVOID-19 mitigation. OSHA, Labor, Agriculture, Transportation, Energy, Education, Housing, Health and Human Services, and even federal building permits… the entire regulatory system and compliance network. Think about Housing and Urban Development (HUD) having new rules about dwellings and complexes for housing grants. Population density; the need to move into the suburbs and the confiscation of private property to “ensure the common safety” of the citizens. If you think this is fear-mongering, I want to to evaluate that cynicism while contemplating this recent example from California: Think about those types of business regulations applied on a National level…. and then, as seen in prior Democrat administrations with IRS etc, think about them also being enforced through the prism of political affiliation. Think about how states that refuse to participate will be cut off from federal grants and funding for college tuition, Medicare and/or medicaid reimbursement, etc. etc. Think about what happens to Main Street USA? Think about companies on the NASDAQ or national companies on the stock-market? Think about how those USA-specific federal COVID compliance regulations apply when considering U.S. business operations -vs- just taking operations overseas without those worries. Think about who in Washington DC then takes control of what types of business interests are allowed to operation…. who determines the winning and losing. Think about how Federal COVID-19 regulations can be used to put the multinational corporate world back (the globalists) on their former financial pathways, even without TPP and TTIP trade deals. [Every domestic regulation weaponized against Main Street USA is a win for the Wall Street multinationals.] Think about how much China and Europe would love to see our economy knee-capped in a Biden regulatory stranglehold; essentially achieving the same objectives as the Paris Climate Treaty. Think long and hard about how far the tentacles of achieving the Green New Deal can extend under the auspices of federal COVID-19 mitigation. Remember, those who are working on this don’t care about the middle-class and they have not for decades. The visibility of the ‘rust belt’ is the reference. This is about government bureaucrats using their DC power-base to control trillions in economic value and sell their ability to influence the winners and losers to the highest foreign bidder. Look at what blue states have already done to seize power and control. Now think about that same manipulative intent spread throughout the entire country by weaponizing federal agencies with advanced regulation. That should start to frame the reference point going forward. Remember, within totalitarian states religion is a risk… the assembly for religious worship is always considered a risk to by those who demand control over free-thought and lives. The national legislative priority will be entirely focused on retention of that power system by generating an entirely new form of congressional representation. New states, new senators, new election systems, and funding for the needs of the executive…. that will be the focus of the facilitating legislative branch. Those behind the executive branch; those controlling Joe Biden; will harness and weaponize the power. The legislative leftists will attempt to ensure the new systems they create under the guise of COVID-19 are never in a position to be withdrawn. Why? – Why all of this effort?… why such extremes?… Follow the money, it’s always about the money.  The globalist ideology is worthless without money.   Wall Street’s Rick Santelli knows, he’s watching the second deployment of an identical playbook. So when your friends ask why, talk about ‘why‘.  The weaponization of COVID is the ongoing crisis that will facilitate government solutions. As the American people resist the bait represented by the COVID crisis, those who need to weaponize it will keep turning up the pressure until they have full totalitarian control… God Forbid."
Texas Returns To Battle: Lawsuits Readied To Stop Socialist Regime Plan,21 JAN 2021,6563,"Now that Joe Biden has been ‘inaugurated,’ at least one state is planning to fight for the Constitutional Rights its citizens have remaining. Texas is gearing up federal lawsuits to stop the removal of rights in that state. The Texas Tribune reported: For eight years under Barack Obama, Texas was a conservative counterweight to a progressive administration, with its Republican leaders campaigning against liberal policies on immigration, the environment and health care and lobbing lawsuit after federal lawsuit challenging scores of Democratic initiatives. When Republicans could not block policies in Congress, they sometimes could in the courts. Now, as Joe Biden enters the White House promising a slew of executive orders and proposed legislation, the notorious “Texas vs. the feds” lawsuits are expected to return in full force. And state leaders have begun to float policy proposals for this year’s legislative session in response to expected action — or inaction — from a White House run by Democrats. Texas has sued the federal government dozens of times in recent years, targeting environmental regulations and immigration reforms. When Republican Gov. Greg Abbott was attorney general, he said his job was to “go into the office, [sue] the federal government and [go] home.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton took up that mantle in 2015, as his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, crooned onstage at campaign events, “I’m a pistol-packin’ mama, and my husband sues Obama.” That didn’t stop when Donald Trump took office. With a Republican in the White House, Texas found more success in its lawsuits against the federal government, many of them challenging Obama-era laws or administrative rules. Under Trump, Texas has often found itself aligned with the federal government in the courts. Most notably, the Trump administration lined up with a Texas-led coalition of red states seeking to end the Affordable Care Act. … Once Biden enters the White House and his appointees lead everything from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Department of Homeland Security, Texas’ conservative leaders will return to a familiar posture: adversary, not ally, to those making national policy.Bottom of Form Top of Form Bottom of Form Paul Nolette, a professor at Marquette University who studies federalism, said he expects Texas to be “at the top of the heap” among Republican attorneys general challenging the new administration in court. According to Nolette, the number of multi-state lawsuits against the federal government skyrocketed from 78 under eight years of Obama to 145 during just four years of Trump. “Republican AGs will take a very aggressive multi-state approach,” Nolette predicted. “It’ll happen quickly.” Some Texas leaders are already forecasting a stormy relationship. Abbott said last week that as the Trump presidency ends, Texas “needs to go back to the fundamentals of the 10th Amendment and reassert that against any potential encroachments that we see under the Biden administration.” “Reinforcing the 10th Amendment is essential now,” Abbott said Thursday at a conference hosted by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, the Austin-based conservative think tank, referring to the amendment concerning states’ rights. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, he said, appreciated their limited role in governments — but “we had challenges with the president before that, Barack Obama,” Abbott added. Without giving details, Abbott also floated the idea of making Texas “a Second Amendment sanctuary state” so that “no government official at any level can come and take your gun away from you.” Leaders of conservative groups in Texas are also anticipating plans to oppose the Biden administration. Chuck DeVore, vice president of national initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told the Houston Chronicle the think tank’s litigation efforts would “probably increase in size significantly.” Rob Henneke, the group’s general counsel, wouldn’t comment on staffing decisions but said there may be more litigation “because there will be more instances of unconstitutional and unlawful executive action from the Biden administration.” In particular, he said, he’s keeping an eye on Biden executive actions on health care, environmental regulations and immigration. Coronavirus-related restrictions, like a national mask mandate, might also provoke legal challenges, he said. The Texas Public Policy Foundation has already sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over its eviction moratorium, a policy Biden supports extending. Immigration will be an especially combative front for the administration and Texas officials. Efforts by the Biden administration to effect immigration policy through executive order are sure to face pushback from Texas. Texas leaders have said they expect to continue spending $800 million every two years on border security, with Abbott saying Texas might have to “redouble” its efforts in a Democratic administration. “We’re gonna have to continue that because I do think under the Biden administration that’s coming in, they’re gonna back to go back to the lax days of the Obama administration, and we’re gonna have more people pouring over the border,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a Houston TV interview last week. Biden will also inherit a pending legal challenge from Paxton over the legality of an Obama-era program that has shielded tens of thousands of Texas’ undocumented immigrants from deportation. The 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program grants recipients a renewable, two-year work permit and a reprieve from deportation proceedings. Trump announced an end to DACA in 2017, but the program has remained after a series of legal challenges, including a 2020 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that ruled the administration did not properly wind down the policy. But Paxton’s lawsuit, filed in 2018, is a separate challenge that questions the legality of the program. As of June, there were about 645,000 beneficiaries of the DACA program in the country, including about 106,400 in Texas, according to federal government statistics. The attorney general’s office did not answer questions from The Texas Tribune about its plans to challenge the Biden administration’s policies. But on Wednesday, after Biden was sworn in, Paxton promised in a tweet to “fight against the many unconstitutional and illegal actions that the new administration will take.” My statement on Inauguration Day  pic.twitter.com/Hb893NG91x — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) January 20, 2021"
Trump’s Farewell Address Spurs Speculation About “Best Is Yet To Come”,20 JAN 2021,16373,"President Trump delivered his farewell address last night, sparking more speculation for what the future of the country holds. Key Notable POTUS quotes today: “You’re going to be seeing incredible things coming”
“The future of this country has never been better”
“We will be back in some form”
“We put this miracle together” [Transcript] – THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans: Four years ago, we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again — for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do — and so much more. This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word. I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House Staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is — a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor, and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about “America First” because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA — that’s Mexico and Canada — a deal that’s worked out very, very well. Also, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China; made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women — almost everyone. Incomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: “Made in the USA.” To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done but we did it. They call it a “medical miracle,” and that’s what they’re calling it right now: a “medical miracle.” Another administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in nine months. We grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before, and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military — all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani. We recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North Star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities; it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible. Now, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.
In America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed, and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me; they came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for — and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. END"
"Trump Pardons 140, But Assange, Snowden Missing from List",20 JAN 2021,6880,"It takes a special kind of man to infuriate everyone… and that’s what Donald Trump did last night by issuing 1400 pardons and commutations, while ignoring pardons for Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. Rumors surfaced last night on social media that Mitch McConnell threatened Trump with impeachment if he pardoned these men. Townhall reported: Less than seven hours before leaving the White House, President Donald Trump issued another batch of pardons and clemencies, this time including Steve Bannon, Lil Wayne, Kodak Black, former Mayor Detroit Mayor Kwame Malik Kilpatrick. Rumors had swirled about the president issuing a large number of pardons and commutations before leaving office on Wednesday. Todd Boulanger – President Trump granted a full pardon to Todd Boulanger. Mr. Boulanger’s pardon is supported by numerous friends, as well as by past and present business associates. In 2008, Mr. Boulanger pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. He has taken full responsibility for his conduct. Mr. Boulanger is a veteran of the United States Army Reserves and was honorably discharged. He has also received an award from the City of the District of Columbia for heroism for stopping and apprehending an individual who assaulted an elderly woman with a deadly weapon on Capitol Hill. Mr. Boulanger is known as a model member of his community. In addition, he is remorseful for his actions and would like to leave his mistakes behind him. Abel Holtz – President Trump granted a full pardon to Abel Holtz. This pardon is supported by Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and friends and business colleagues in his community.

"COVID Vaccine Deaths Increase: 55 In US, 29 In Norway, Hundreds of “Life Threatening” Reactions",18 JAN 2021,5934,"Scientists and concerned citizens are calling for the suspension of the COVID vaccine, which uses experimental mRNA method, after a shocking number of deaths and irreversible reactions have occurred. In the US, the fatality rate is at 55. Zero Hedge reported: Amid increasing calls for suspension of the use of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines produced by companies such as Pfizer, especially among elderly people, the situation in Norway has escalated significantly as the Scandi nation has now registered a total of 29 deaths among people over the age of 75 who’ve had their first COVID-19 vaccination shot. As Bloomberg reports, this adds six to the number of known fatalities in Norway, and also lowers the age group thought to be affected from 80. Until Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech was the only vaccine available in Norway, and “all deaths are thus linked to this vaccine,” the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a written response to Bloomberg on Saturday. “There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,” the agency said. All the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders,” it said. “Most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.” Norway’s experience has prompted the country to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill… the exact group that ‘the science’ shows are actually at risk from this virus. Pfizer and BioNTech are working with the Norwegian regulator to investigate the deaths in Norway, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. The agency found that “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations,” Pfizer said. However, it’s not just Norway as The Epoch Times’ Zachary Stieber reports that fifty-five people in the United States have died after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, according to reports submitted to a federal system. Deaths have occurred among people receiving both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, according to the reports. In some cases, patients died within days of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. One man, a 66-year-old senior home resident in Colorado, was sleepy and stayed in bed a day after getting Moderna’s vaccine. Early the next morning, on Christmas Day, the resident “was observed in bed lying still, pale, eyes half open and foam coming from mouth and unresponsive,” the VAERS report states. “He was not breathing and with no pulse.” In another case, a 93-year-old South Dakota man was injected with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Jan. 4 around 11 a.m. About two hours later, he said he was tired and couldn’t continue with the physical therapy he was doing any longer. He was taken back to his room, where he said his legs felt heavy. Soon after, he stopped breathing. A nurse declared a do-not-resuscitate order. In addition to the deaths, people have reported 96 life-threatening events following COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as 24 permanent disabilities, 225 hospitalizations, and 1,388 emergency room visits. It’s not just the old and frail, in Israel, which proudly lays claim to the greatest vaccination effort in the world (largest percentage of the population inoculated), As RT reports, at least 13 Israelis have experienced facial paralysis after being administered the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, a month after the US Food and Drug Administration reported similar issues but said they weren’t linked to the jab. Israeli outlet Ynet reported, citing the Health Ministry, that officials believe the number of such cases could be higher. “For at least 28 hours I walked around with it [facial paralysis],” one person who had the side effect told Ynet. “I can’t say it was completely gone afterwards, but other than that I had no other pains, except a minor pain where the injection was, but there was nothing beyond that.” Ynet quoted Prof. Galia Rahav, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba Medical Center, who said she did not feel “comfortable” with administering the second dose to someone who had received the first jab and subsequently suffered from paralysis. “No one knows if this is connected to the vaccine or not. That’s why I would refrain from giving a second dose to someone who suffered from paralysis after the first dose,” she told the outlet. Finally, as we noted yesterday following the news of rising post-vaccination deaths in Noway, health experts from Wuhan, China, called on Norway and other countries to suspend the use of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines produced by companies such as Pfizer, especially among elderly people. China’s Global Times reports Chinese experts said the death incident should be assessed cautiously to understand whether the death was caused by vaccines or other preexisting conditions of these individuals. Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist from Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Friday that the death incident, if proven to be caused by the vaccines, showed that the effect of the Pfizer vaccine and other mRNA vaccines is not as good as expected, as the main purpose of mRNA vaccines is to heal patients. … A Beijing-based immunologist, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Friday that the world should suspend the use of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine represented by Pfizer, as this new technology has not proven safety in large-scale use or in preventing any infectious diseases. Older people, especially those over 80, should not be recommended to receive any COVID-19 vaccine, he said. All of which is a problem since it is the elderly who are at most risk (quite frankly at any real risk at all) and thus who need the protection the most. The Chinese health experts instead say that the most elderly and frail should be recommended to take medicines to improve their immune system.  "
President Trump Just Signed A National Proclamation On The “Sanctity Of Human Life”,18 JAN 2021,5382,"President Trump just signed a proclamation regarding the sanctity of human life. The White House posted: Every human life is a gift to the world.  Whether born or unborn, young or old, healthy or sick, every person is made in the holy image of God.  The Almighty Creator gives unique talents, beautiful dreams, and a great purpose to every person.  On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we celebrate the wonder of human existence and renew our resolve to build a culture of life where every person of every age is protected, valued, and cherished. This month, we mark nearly 50 years since the United States Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision.  This constitutionally flawed ruling overturned State laws that banned abortion, and has resulted in the loss of more than 50 million innocent lives.  But strong mothers, courageous students, and incredible community members and people of faith are leading a powerful movement to awaken America’s conscience and restore the belief that every life is worthy of respect, protection, and care.  Because of the devotion of countless pro-life pioneers, the call for every person to recognize the sanctity of life is resounding more loudly in America than ever before.  Over the last decade, the rate of abortions has steadily decreased, and today, more than three out of every four Americans support restrictions on abortion. Since my first day in office, I have taken historic action to protect innocent lives at home and abroad.  I reinstituted and strengthened President Ronald Reagan’s Mexico City Policy, issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title Ten taxpayer funding, and took action to protect the conscience rights of doctors, nurses, and organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor.  My Administration has protected the vital role of faith-based adoption.  At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life.  Just a few months ago, our Nation also joined 32 other countries in signing the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which bolsters global efforts to provide better healthcare to women, protect all human life, and strengthen families. As a Nation, restoring a culture of respect for the sacredness of life is fundamental to solving our country’s most pressing problems.  When each person is treated as a beloved child of God, individuals can reach their full potential, communities will flourish, and America will be a place of even greater hope and freedom.  That is why it was my profound privilege to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life, and it is what motives my actions to improve our Nation’s adoption and foster care system, secure more funding for Down syndrome research, and expand health services for single mothers.  Over the past 4 years, I have appointed more than 200 Federal judges who apply the Constitution as written, including three Supreme Court Justices — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.  I also increased the child tax credit, so that mothers are financially supported as they take on the noble task of raising strong and healthy children.  And, recently, I signed an Executive Order on Protecting Vulnerable Newborn and Infant Children, which defends the truth that every newborn baby has the same rights as all other individuals to receive life-saving care. The United States is a shining example of human rights for the world.  However, some in Washington are fighting to keep the United States among a small handful of nations — including North Korea and China — that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks.  I join with countless others who believe this is morally and fundamentally wrong, and today, I renew my call on the Congress to pass legislation prohibiting late-term abortion. Since the beginning, my Administration has been dedicated to lifting up every American, and that starts with protecting the rights of the most vulnerable in our society — the unborn.  On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we promise to continue speaking out for those who have no voice.  We vow to celebrate and support every heroic mother who chooses life.  And we resolve to defend the lives of every innocent and unborn child, each of whom can bring unbelievable love, joy, beauty, and grace into our Nation and the entire world. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22, 2021, as National Sanctity of Human Life Day.  Today, I call on the Congress to join me in protecting and defending the dignity of every human life, including those not yet born.  I call on the American people to continue to care for women in unexpected pregnancies and to support adoption and foster care in a more meaningful way, so every child can have a loving home.  And finally, I ask every citizen of this great Nation to listen to the sound of silence caused by a generation lost to us, and then to raise their voices for all affected by abortion, both seen and unseen. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP"
Gates Et. Al Developing ‘Digital’ COVID ‘Vaccination’ Passport,16 JAN 2021,2598,"A coalition to make sure that everyone is ‘forced’ to receive the highly suspect mRNA vaccine for COVID is underway, headed by billionaires who have not made their desire for ‘depopulation’ a secret, many argue. Breitbart News reported: A coalition of tech and health organizations including Oracle, Microsoft, and the Mayo Clinic, is reportedly working to develop a digital COVID-19 vaccination passport that would allow businesses, airlines, and governments to check if individuals have received the vaccine. The Hill reports that a coalition of health and technology organizations are working to develop a new digital COVID-19 vaccination passport that could be checked by businesses, airlines, and countries to confirm if an individual has received the vaccine. The coalition includes tech giants such as Microsoft and Oracle, along with the Mayo Clinic. On Thursday, the Vaccination Credential Initiative announced that it is developing technology to confirm vaccinations in case governments mandate that people provide proof that they have received a vaccination in order to travel. The coalition hopes that the tech will allow people to “demonstrate their health status to safely return to travel, work, school and life while protecting their data privacy.” The group is using work from the Commons Project’s international digital document that verifies a person has tested negative for COVID-19. Currently, the Commons Project’s system, which was created in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation, is being utilized by three major airline alliances. The coalition is reportedly currently in discussions with several governments to create a program requiring either negative tests or proof of vaccination to enter the country, according to Commons Project chief executive Paul Meyer. Meyer stated in a release: “The goal of the Vaccination Credential Initiative is to empower individuals with digital access to their vaccination records so they can use tools like CommonPass to safely return to travel, work, school, and life, while protecting their data privacy.” Mike Sicilia, the executive vice president of Oracle’s Global Business Units, commented that the passport “needs to be as easy as online banking,” and added: “We are committed to working collectively with the technology and medical communities, as well as global governments, to ensure people will have secure access to this information where and when they need it.” For your information: A nurse in Broward County, Florida. pic.twitter.com/CviorA20RY — Michael O'Fallon – Sovereign Nations (@SovMichael) January 14, 2021"
Los Angeles Public Schools Require All Students To Receive Experimental COVID Vaccine,15 JAN 2021,2958,"For students who live in Los Angeles and who are scheduled to return to public schools, they will be forced to accept a COVID Vaccine if they want to attend the brick and mortar schools. The New York Post reported: Austin Beutner, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said Monday that students will have to receive the inoculation once it is available before heading back into the classroom, according to a report. The Los Angeles Times reported that Beutner compared the move to how schools already require vaccinations for measles and mumps. He said that he hopes all students in the system will be vaccinated by January 2022. [The media and many ‘experts’ seem to forget that this vaccine is NOT like measles or mumps. Those are based on building an immunity through a small actual does of the virus. The COVID vaccine changes the very framework of your RNA.] The paper reported that he made the comments during a pre-recorded briefing and told parents who are skeptical about the vaccine that there is the option for “a child to stay online learning and therefore not have to go back to campus.” The Pfizer vaccine authorized in the U.S. last month is for people 16 and older. Testing began in October in children as young as 12 and is expected to take several more months. The Food and Drug Administration will have to decide when there’s enough data to allow emergency use in this age group. Dr. Robert Frenck, who is the lead researcher for Pfizer’s study in kids at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, told the Associated Press in December that even though children usually don’t get very sick from COVID-19, they can spread the virus to others. At least 1.6 million youth have been infected, 8,000 have been hospitalized and 162 have died from the virus, he noted. The Times pointed out that Beutner did not suggest that schools stay closed until all children are inoculated. Not The Bee commented: The Los Angeles Unified School District is the 2nd largest district in America and enrolls over 600,000 students in kindergarten through twelfth grade at over 1,000 schools. They’re all gonna have to get the Rona Poke if they wanna continue going to school there in person. Are we all ignoring the fact that schools — especially below middle school — have been proven to NOT spread the virus? And even Dr. Fauci said so? Are we all ignoring the fact that this is a vaccine that has been thrown together in record time without any of the standard time-testing that all other vaccines get — which is why tons of healthcare professionals are refusing to get it? Are we all ignoring the fact that these are KIDS? … But these are young kids who have their whole lives in front of them. What if, God forbid, some medium-term effects begin manifesting from the vaccine? They’ll have to deal with them their whole lives. And what if, God Forbid! This vaccine produces a ‘super strain’ like the Gates funded/developed vaccines for Polio?"
Pfizer Vaccine Deaths Mount In Israel As 240 Contract COVID 19 After Injection,9 JAN 2021,4849,"Health Impact News has been cataloging the problems with the Pfizer vaccine for COVID 19, and the results are less than encouraging. RT.com reported: With the vaccine not providing immediate immunity to the coronavirus, over two hundred Israeli citizens have been diagnosed with the disease days after getting the Pfizer/BioNTech jabs, local media reported. The number of those who got Covid-19 despite being vaccinated was at around 240 people, according to data from Channel 13 News. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which the Israeli health authorities rely on, doesn’t contain the coronavirus and can’t infect the recipient. But time is needed for the genetic code in the drug to train the immune system to recognize and attack the disease. The Jewish state is currently undertaking a massive vaccination campaign, which already saw over one million people or almost 12 percent of the population getting the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. That’s the largest span per capita in the world, according to Oxford University. The first phase of the program aims to immunize medics and elderly people before expanding on to other categories. Around one in a thousand people have reported mild side effects after the injection, including weakness, dizziness and fever as well as pain, swelling and redness in the spot where the shot was given. Only a few dozen of them required medical attention, the Health Ministry said. Since vaccinations kicked off on December 20, at least four people in Israel died shortly after getting the jab, Kan public broadcaster reported. However, the Health Ministry said that three fatalities were unrelated to the vaccine, with the fourth case of an 88-year-old man with preexisting conditions currently being investigated. Read the full article at RT.com. Vaccine Impact reported: The Mexican Press is reporting that a 32-year-old female doctor in Coahuila has suffered seizures and become paralyzed after receiving the Pfizer experimental COVID mRNA vaccine on December 30, 2020. Dr. Karla Cecilia Pérez Osorio reportedly was working as an internist at the General Hospital of Zone No. 7, in the municipality of Monclova. She was subsequently transferred to the High Specialty Medical Unit No. 25 of the IMSS, in Monterrey, Nuevo León. She was reportedly evaluated by a neurologist and diagnosed with transverse myelitis, a known side effect of vaccines, and specifically of the COVID experimental mRNA vaccines as this injury was observed in some of the vaccine trials of the various COVID19 experimental trials being conducted around the world. According to the Mayo Clinic, transverse myelitis: “can cause pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, sensory problems, or bladder and bowel dysfunction… Other conditions, such as a stroke of the spinal cord, are often confused with transverse myelitis.” Medical authorities in Mexico are downplaying the adverse reaction as “mild,” but relatives reported yesterday (January 4, 2021) that although she is conscious, she has difficulties speaking and moving her legs and arms. Her husband, Ángel Palestino Gallardo, and her cousin, Carolina Rivas Gallardo, confirmed that she had tingling in her lips and extremities just after receiving the experimental vaccine, so they gave her medication and she returned to work. But 20 minutes later she experienced paralysis of her arms and legs and suffered several seizures until she was unconscious. This incident follows a report out of Portugal that a “perfectly healthy” 41-year-old Pediatric Assistant and mother of 2 died suddenly after receiving the experimental Pfizer COVID vaccine. See: “Perfectly Healthy” 41-year-old Pediatric Assistant Dies Suddenly After Injected with Experimental Pfizer COVID Vaccine In the U.S., there appears to be a public cover-up in place to try and conceal these injuries and deaths, as the CDC received a lot of negative reactions to their first report following the FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer experimental vaccine. The CDC’s own report showed that in the first week alone in the U.S. 3150 injuries occurred, serious enough to prevent the healthcare workers from performing their jobs and performing their normal activities, requiring medical treatment. See: 3,150 Injuries in First Week of Illegal Experimental COVID Vaccines Among American Healthcare Workers! Pregnant Women Included This report was provided during the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting on December 22, 2020, and no further reports or meetings have been published since then. One has to wonder why? It doesn’t help when a nurse in Tennessee, Tiffany Dover, passes out on live camera just after receiving the Pfizer experimental COVID vaccine, and then disappears, leading the hospital to fake a video of her supposedly appearing alive, when Internet sleuths uncovered records of her death."
COVID Vaccine ‘Severe Reactions’ Happening At Rate Higher Than Flu Shot,7 JAN 2021,3937,"The numbers of adverse effects from the COVID vaccines seem to be scarier than the virus itself, many people argue. And apparently, the number of severe allergic reactions is higher than the flu shot. The Epoch Times reported: Severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are happening at a higher rate than adverse reactions to flu vaccines, federal health officials said on Jan. 6. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the reactions, known as anaphylaxis, are happening at a rate of 11.1 per million vaccinations. With flu vaccines, anaphylaxis occurs at a rate of 1.3 per 1 million injections. “The anaphylaxis rate for COVID-19 vaccines may seem high compared to flu vaccines, but I want to reassure you, this is still a rare outcome,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a call. Twenty-one people experienced severe allergic reactions out of those who received the first 1.89 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which were administered between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23, 2020. Seventeen of the people who experienced severe allergic reactions had a history of allergies or allergic reactions. The average time between getting a shot and symptom onset was 13 minutes; most patients experienced symptoms within 15 minutes. The median age of the patients was 40 years old. Information available for 20 of the 21 showed they’d recovered or had been discharged, the CDC said in a report. Eighty-six other cases were determined to be allergic reactions that weren’t severe. Sixty-one were considered nonallergic adverse events. The remaining seven are still under investigation. There’s no federal database of confirmed allergic reactions. The report doesn’t include data for the past two weeks. Approximately 3.4 million doses have been administered since the time period studied in the report. Hundreds of people who received one of the new vaccines, including one from Moderna, were sent to hospital emergency rooms, according to data that was reported to federal authorities through Jan. 5. Over 1,000 experienced an adverse event. Messonnier noted that the CDC has been adapting its recommendations as it reviews reports of adverse events. The agency recently said anyone who experiences an allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine shouldn’t get a second dose. The agency also directed administrating officials to observe anyone with a history of allergic reactions to injectable vaccines or a history of anaphylaxis due to any cause for 30 minutes post-vaccination. The typical observation period is 15 minutes. Anyone with a history of allergic reactions to any components of the vaccines, officials said last month, should not get them. The benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks, officials have stressed. “Our vaccine safety systems haven’t picked up any worrisome signals. This means that right now the known and potential benefits of the current COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the known and potential risks getting the COVID-19,” Messonnier said. “That doesn’t mean, however, that we couldn’t see potential serious health events in the future.” The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which issued emergency authorization for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, are reviewing all serious adverse event reports with clinicians to figure out if they’re connected with vaccination. The reactions could be coincidental, as are many adverse events, according to Messoinner. Both vaccines are new types that use Messenger RNA, a molecule that teaches a body’s cells to make a spike protein that then triggers an immune response. That differs from vaccines of the past, which deliver a weakened or inactivated germ into bodies to activate a response. Many people wonder why the old fashioned kind of vaccine couldn’t be used for this virus, which has a survival rate of over 98 percent."
Mask Mandates Explained: CA Made $1 Billion Deal With China For Face Masks,6 JAN 2021,10404,"If you’ve wondered why California and other democrat states are so keen on forcing Americans to wear masks that don’t work, Judicial Watch has learned of one potential reason. The liberal controlled state deviated from the “normal” procurement process to cut a $1 billion deal with the Chinese Communist Party to make masks. Judicial Watch reported: Judicial Watch announced today that it received 848 pages of documents revealing the contract materials and communications related to a $1 billion contract for face masks between the California Office of Emergency Services and the Chinese Communist Party linked BYD. BYD reportedly has been barred by law from some federal contracts for providing faulty electric vehicles and lithium batteries to American buyers. The documents reveal that the Office of Emergency Services Assistant Chief Counsel admits that they deviated from their normal procurement process for this contract. Additionally, in the contract between Office of Emergency Services and BYD, BYD uses a different name, Global Healthcare Product Solutions, LLC., and BYD provides no liability or warranty for the masks if they are faulty. The records were produced in response to a Judicial Watch California Public Records request sent to the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services for all records and communications related to the state’s contract for masks with BYD. The records include an April 7, 2020, email from the Office of Emergency Services Assistant Chief Counsel Jennifer Bollinger to Oscar Su, Senior Director of BYD America, in which Bollinger states, “Our normal procurement process has been deviated from given the exigency of the situation.” In an April 6, 2020, email Stella Lu, the president of BYD Motors (the guarantor of the masks) tells Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the Office of Emergency Services that they should, “open champagne tomorrow morning at our conference call,” where they will finalize the purchase by California of $1 billion worth of BYD masks. On April 7, John Zhuang, counsel for BYD and BYD’s lead negotiator, sent the finalized contracts to Bollinger, who led the negotiations for the Office of Emergency Services. Bollinger replied, “This is very exciting!!! We will circle back today with the signature as soon as we can.” In an amendment to the master agreement, BYD had to refund $247 million to California of the $495 million down payment they had received apparently because they weren’t able to meet the deadline of receiving National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certification for their N95 masks. The certification deadline was extended from April 30, 2020, to May 31, 2020. On March 28, 2020, Brian Stansbury, a member of the board of the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System, emailed Grady Joseph of the CA Office of Emergency Services and Paul Teng of Himalaya Capital in order to introduce Joseph to Teng, saying, “Grady as we discussed the pension system for the City of San Francisco – the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System (SFERS) – reached out to our investment partners to see how they can help in the fight against COVID-19. Teng responded, offering to assist with the procurement of N95 masks: “Paul I would like to introduce Grady Joseph Assistant Director of Recovery Operations for Cal OES from the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. We know Grady is in good hands and want to thank you for your partnership.” Teng later responds, “Hi Grady, nice to meet you through email though I wish it was under better circumstances. We have a deep relationship with BYD which is now the largest mask maker in the world capable of producing 10MM masks a day. I have just facilitated an order between BYD [redacted] to procure 4 MM in N95 masks and 3 MM surgical masks that will be delivered over the next three weeks or so in batches. Happy to make the same connection as well. My number is below if you need to reach me.” Brian Stansbury, a member of the board of San Francisco Employees Retirement System (SFERS), introduced Paul Teng of Himalaya Capital (with whom SFERS reportedly had invested $200 million and which Stansbury calls their “investment partners”), to Grady Joseph, Office of Emergency Services Asst. Director Of Recovery Operations to help in the procurement of face masks. Teng tells Joseph that Himalaya has a “deep relationship” with BYD, which he claims, “is now the largest mask maker in the world.” Oscar Su, a BYD executive introduced by Teng to Joseph and another Office of Emergency Services official, responds, “Thanks Paul for the introduction.” According to the “Equipment Master Supply Purchase Order Agreement” effective April 7, 2020, BYD lists the “Seller” to the State of California as a Wilmington, DE-based company called Global Healthcare Product Solutions, LLC. The contract states that the “Buyer will support the Seller’s efforts to obtain the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (“NIOSH”) certification for the N95 masks purchased under this Agreement.” A provision of the contract calls for BYD Motors, a subsidiary of BYD Co, Ltd, to be the Guarantor of the contract, in the event the Seller breached the “Guaranteed Material Obligation” of the contract. Pursuant to a “Sweatfree Code of Conduct” provision of the contract, the Seller guarantees that no material furnished to the Buyer “have been produced in whole or in part by sweatshop labor, forced labor, convict labor, indentured labor under penal sanction, abusive forms of child labor or exploitation of children in sweatshop labor…” In a “Nondiscrimination” clause of the contract, the Seller agrees to not “unlawfully discriminate” against any employee based on “ancestry” or “religious creed.” The provision also calls for the Seller to adhere to the “Fair Employment and Housing Act.” California’s Office of Emergency Services had to provide a 50% down payment totaling $495 million (one-half of the total $990 million contract) under the payment terms of the contract. According to a purchase order, Global Healthcare Product Solutions (the Seller) is a subsidiary of BYD International Development based in Los Angeles. BYD was to supply 300 million N95 masks at a unit price of $3.30 each. In an April 3, 2020, email exchange between Bollinger and BYD’s counsel, Zhuang, Bollinger asks Zhuang why BYD is using a company called “Global Healthcare Product Solutions, LLC” as the “contracting entity” for the masks. She notes that “I understood this to be a contract directly with BYD North America.” Zhuang then responds, saying, “BYD’s contract manufacturing division started Global Healthcare Product Solutions earlier this year to sell healthcare products in the US … They picked the name because they wanted folks to recognize it as a business that sold healthcare products, not to be conflated with the EV [Electric Vehicle] / clean energy business.”   In the master agreement, under “Limits of Liability” section, the contract notes that “In no event shall Seller be liable for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages …” In the contract provision titled “Limits on Warranty,” the contract notes that Seller … makes no warranties or representations … as to the Equipment … provided for under this Agreement …” The contract contains a provision that “Seller warrants that no gratuities … were offered or given by the Seller, or any agent or representative of the Seller, to any officer or employee of the Buyer with a view toward securing the Agreement …” California purchased a total of 300 million N95 masks from BYD for $990 million on April 7, 2020. In an April 2, 2020, email, Trevor Houser of “Frontline Support” connects multiple BYD and the Office of Emergency Services representatives. Frontline Support shares the same address in Oakland, CA, as Rhodium Group, where Trevor Houser is listed as a partner. Rhodium describes itself as “an independent research provider” combining “economic data and policy insight to analyze global trends.” In an April 24, 2020, email, Shige Honjo from “Frontline Support” provided advice/directives to BYD on quality control measures for the masks that were to be provided to the Office of Emergency Services, describing various metrics that BYD should supply to ensure that the masks being provided met certain standards. These metrics included, “Product cleanliness spec – number and size of particles allowed, blemish, etc.” and “Reliability specs – when does filtration become no good, how many times can the straps be stretched out, etc.” The BYD representative in charge of handling shipments of the masks to the Office of Emergency Services is Sean Li, Procurement and Logistic Supervisor of BYD Coach and Bus LLC. In an email on March 21, 2020, a California lobbyist named Mark Weideman sent Gov. Newsom’s Chief of Staff, Ann O’Leary, a copy of an article about BYD titled “A Chinese Electric Car Maker Backed by Warren Buffett Re-Tooled to Make Face Masks When Covid-19 Hit – Now It Says It’s the World’s Largest Mask Factory.” Weideman says in his email that BYD was willing to “donate” 50,000 masks to California, along with hand sanitizer, and asked if someone could “notify GGN” [presumably Governor Gavin Newsom] so they could “hopefully execute on BYD’s offer to help California, a place they and their unionized workforce call home for their North American operations.” Abby Browning of the Office of Emergency Services responds to Weideman, noting she’d been forwarded his email from O’Leary, and said, “I am happy to help you facilitate this donation.” Weideman replies to Browning, “Yes, address and receiving information would be great. I am copying Frank Girardot and Nancy Liu with BYD who can help coordinate logistics.” In an April 24, 2020, email exchange among the Office of Emergency Services officials handling delivery of 3.4 million masks from BYD, CA Office of Emergency Services Dep. Director Mitchell Medigovich notes that “The physical count will be at the airport and upon movement into the warehouse for inventory and QC [quality control], we will notify receipt and if there are any deficiencies. We are only checking 1% due to volume.” “The documents show how a well-connected and controversial Chinese firm was able to get a leg up on a billion-dollar mask contract with California politicians,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton."
New Info Released On Rep’s Death: COVID Blamed But He Suffered Heart Attack After Procedure,31 DEC 2020,1533,"Every media outlet on Tuesday blasted the news that Louisiana Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, age 41, died from COVID. However, like every supposed ‘COVID death,’ he really passed away from a heart attack following a hospital procedure. The fact that he supposedly had COVID-19 was apparently enough to blame the virus. The New York Post reported: The 41-year-old was receiving treatment in the intensive care unit at Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport when he died Tuesday, the Monroe News-Star reported. LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor G.E. Ghali confirmed Letlow underwent an operation related to the virus and later went into cardiac arrest. “It’s devastating to our entire team,” Ghali told the paper, adding that he “had no underlying conditions.” The Republican had first announced that he tested positive for the virus Dec. 18 and said he was quarantining at his Richland Parish home. But his health began to deteriorate and on Dec. 19, he was admitted to St. Francis Medical Center, and eventually transferred to Ochsner LSU Health. Letlow is survived by his wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, in addition to his children, 3-year-old Jeremiah and 11-month-old Jacqueline, the paper reported. “The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” Letlow’s spokesman Andrew Bautsch said in a statement to the Monroe News-Star. Letlow was set to be sworn in to Congress on Sunday after he won the Pelican State’s 5th District seat in a Dec. 5 runoff race."
DC Lawmakers Pass Bill To Vaccinate Kids Without Parental Knowledge Or Consent,30 DEC 2020,5541,"In Washington, DC, lawmakers just made it possible for children (namely students) to become vaccinated without their parent’s knowledge or consent. Neon Nettle reported: The “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act,” B23-017, was passed in D.C. last month. The bill that permits a child aged 11 years or older “to consent to receive a vaccine where the vaccination is recommended by the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “It also establishes that if a minor is able to comprehend the need for, the nature of, and any significant risks inherent in the medical care then informed consent is established.” The bill not only permits children of this age to provide consent to doctors and other vaccine administrators without a parent’s knowledge or consent, but also requires school administrators, insurance companies, and medical personnel to conceal a child’s vaccination from their parents. In lines 37–38, the legislation mandates that “[p]roviders who administer immunizations under the authority of this subsection shall seek reimbursement, without parental consent, directly from the insurer” rather than involving a parent in this process. The bill requires school officials to hide a child’s vaccination from their parents Secondly, it mandates that insurance companies are not to notify parents of such payouts in the standard way, according to LifeSite News. “Insurers shall not send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) [to the child’s parents] for services provided,” the bill states (line 40). Finally, B23-017 requires a health care provider to leave part of the immunization record “blank” in order to conceal from parents that their own child has been vaccinated (lines 48–52). In addition to this being a violation of fundamental and natural parental rights, critics say it may also lead to situations where children could be double-vaccinated. Following such a “confidential” vaccination of the child in school, a parent may take him to the doctor at a later occasion, where he may be vaccinated again. More fundamentally, if this bill becomes law, The Vaccine Reaction (V.R.) warns, “it is clear that minor children will be at risk of being pressured and coerced into getting a COVID-19 vaccine behind their parents’ back.” V.R. also demonstrates how B23-0171 violates the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA), which requires health care providers to supply parents or guardians with vaccine information from the CDC prior to administering the vaccine to their minor child. The CDC itself affirms this to be a legal requirement on its website. According to an “FAQ” question, “Is there a requirement to verify that parents/legal representatives have actually received and reviewed the VIS (Vaccine information Statement)?,” the answer is “Yes.” Obviously, V.R. argues, children are “far less likely than an adult parent to understand personal and family medical history, including vaccine reactions,” nor do they “have the same kind of critical thinking skills or emotional maturity required to make a well-informed vaccine benefit-risk decision compared to an adult.” In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed the NCVIA, which, with its 1987 amendment, and a subsequent Supreme Court decision, effectively removed all legal and fiscal liability from vaccine-manufacturers, doctors, and other vaccine administrators when mandatory vaccines cause even permanent injury or death. Earlier this year, federal regulators explicitly reinforced the same policy for coronavirus vaccine–makers. Some degree of liability is now covered by the U.S. taxpayers in the federally run Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, also created by the NCVIA. To date, this program has paid out approximately $4.4 billion as compensation for permanent injury and death. If a child accepts a vaccination without parents’ knowledge, and if he develops a serious reaction, parents may not recognize the symptoms as being potentially related to their child’s vaccine and fail to seek appropriate medical care in a timely fashion. Such a situation could be life-threatening. And considering the fact that vaccine-manufacturers are immune from all liability, V.R. affirms, “[t]here is no justification for the state to eliminate a parent’s legal and moral right to make an informed benefit and risk decision about vaccination on behalf of a minor child.” According to V.R., B23-0171 also violates the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in compelling schools to conceal the vaccine status of children from their parents. FERPA “guarantees parents the right to have access to their children’s education records. “The definition of ‘education records’ include health and vaccine records at the K-12 level.” As parents have become more self-educated and less comfortable with their children being given different vaccinations, support for the circumventing of their natural rights, with minor consent legislation, has recently grown in the medical community. Last year, The New England Journal of Medicine published an opinion piece supporting the idea, and the American Medical Association passed a resolution encouraging the ratification of state laws allowing minors to consent to vaccinations. Due to this effort, 34 minor consent bills were introduced in state legislatures over the last two years. Having listened to parents, legislators have rejected a total of 33 of them, with the D.C. bill being the only one remaining in play. More such bills are expected to be introduced across the nation in 2021."
GA Dem Blasted For Church Camp ‘Abuse’: Witnesses Come Forward About Disgusting Acts,29 DEC 2020,6552,"Apparently, many in the media have known about the horrific abuses connected to a church camp overseen by Georgia Democrat candidate Raphael Warnock. However, it is just now being made public thanks to a detailed report by the Washington Free Beacon: Among the indignities 12-year-old Anthony Washington endured at the church camp overseen by Reverend Raphael Warnock: counselors who tossed urine on him and locked him outside his cabin overnight. Washington, now 30, recounted the events in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon and said his experience at the camp resulted in a 2003 lawsuit that ended two years later, when Washington says he and his family received a large financial settlement. Washington’s account of the 2002 events provides the first direct insight into the alleged abuse and neglect that transpired at Camp Farthest Out, which Warnock oversaw as senior pastor of Maryland’s Douglas Memorial Community church, and raises new questions for the Democrat, who is currently vying for a Senate seat in Georgia. Washington expressed surprise when he was told Warnock is currently running for U.S. Senate in Georgia. “I don’t think nobody like [Warnock] should be running for damn Senate nowhere, running a camp like that,” he told the Free Beacon. “He should not be running for government.” Warnock has faced scrutiny over his 2002 arrest for allegedly obstructing a child abuse investigation by Maryland State Police that centered on the camp’s treatment of children. Washington’s account is buttressed by records from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, obtained by the Free Beacon earlier this month, which indicated that campers were routinely left unsupervised; staffers were not subject to required criminal background check; and at least five cases of child abuse or neglect were brought against the camp’s director, who was ultimately forced to resign. Warnock served as senior pastor at Baltimore’s Douglas Memorial Community Church from 2001 until around 2005. His job included overseeing the expansion of the church’s sleepaway camp, Camp Farthest Out, which served inner city children. Warnock’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Free Beacon reached out to Washington and members of his family because his name appears on a lawsuit filed against Warnock, the camp, and several of the counselors. “I just wanted to get the hell away from that camp,” Washington said in an interview. “I didn’t want to spend another day there. … That camp was real messed up.” A court docket from the case shows that lawyers from both sides moved to dismiss the case “with prejudice” in May 2005, a resolution that frequently occurs when lawsuits are settled out of court. Officials from the courthouse and the Maryland state archives told the Free Beacon that they are unable to locate any records from the case. The lawyer who represented Washington’s family said he was unable to discuss the matter on the record. Washington’s sister, Dominique, who also attended Camp Farthest Out the summer her brother says he was abused, corroborated the family’s involvement in the lawsuit when contacted by the Free Beacon. Another source close to the Washington family told the Free Beacon that the lawsuit was related to an incident when counselors “poured urine on [Anthony], at the camp.” Washington said the camp was his first extended trip away from his parents as a child, and his first time in such a rural environment. His mother sent the two children because they had recently moved from California to Baltimore and she hoped they would make friends in the area, according to Washington. Counselors were young, in their late teens or early 20s, and showed little interest in taking care of the campers, Washington said. As a punishment for wetting his bed, he said a counselor forced him to spend the next night sleeping outside by himself on the basketball court. “I’m like, ‘Hell no I’m not, it’s cold out there,’” he said. “[The counselors] wouldn’t let me in the house, not at all. … Shut the door to the cabin, locked it,” he said. “It was dark. There wasn’t nothing out there but the basketball court. I ain’t never experienced nothing like that. Like, you’re not in a tent, you’re not in nothing. You’re just out, God knows where.” Counselors also threw urine on him from a bucket they used when there wasn’t a bathroom nearby, he added. “I went through that experience myself. I don’t even like talking about this shit. That shit happened. … It was like in a bucket. They would keep that shit in a bucket,” he said. Washington said he saw counselors “grab kids,” but didn’t know the extent of abuse at the camp or whether others had experiences similar to his. “I just knew that shit happened to me, and that’s what I was worried about, me and my sister,” he said. Campers were prohibited from calling their parents, he said. When he was finally able to tell his mother what happened, she was furious at the camp. “I can hear her in there, screaming at them,” Washington said. “Next thing I knew, my mother was going to court. … I thank my mother for doing what she did. She is a life saver.” The family eventually received a financial settlement in the case, said Washington. At least three state agencies—the Maryland State Police, the Department of Social Services, and the Department of Health—looked into allegations of child abuse at the camp between 2002 and 2003, according to government records obtained by the Free Beacon. Warnock was arrested at Camp Farthest Out on July 31, 2002, after a Maryland state trooper said he repeatedly disrupted her interviews with counselors while she was investigating allegations of child abuse. Warnock and another reverend were charged with “hindering and obstructing” police, but the charges were later dropped by the state prosecutor. When inspectors from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene visited Camp Farthest Out in 2002, they also found multiple health and safety violations. “Staff are not supervising campers,” wrote a health inspector in a July 31, 2002, report. “Conversations w/ medical staff & pool staff indicate that this is routine among the counselors. It was observed during inspection today.” In June 2003, the Department of Health denied Camp Farthest Out’s certificate to operate a youth camp. One reason for the denial, according to the records, was that the camp failed to report at least five findings of child abuse levied against its director, Brian Carter, by the Department of Social Services."
CDC Silently ‘Updates’ COVID Guidelines: Masks Don’t Work,29 DEC 2020,1254,"In a recent, silent ‘update,’ the CDC website explained that masks don’t work. Hal Turner caught the change and reported: The CDC quietly updated their guidelines to say that masks don’t work if you’ve come into close contact with someone for 15 minutes or more, according to the CDC website. The media is almost completely ignoring this fact. According to the CDC, anyone who has symptoms or tests positive is a risk to others even if masks are worn. According to the CDC update: Exposure to Note: This is irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask or whether the contact was wearing respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE). Hal Turner Remarks “Irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask.” ???? So, what’s the point of these mask mandates again? The point is now, what it has always been: Submission.  You do what they tell you or else they – and their useful idiot pals — will make your life miserable. Even though the mask serves no purpose, these dingbats and their useful idiots DEMAND you wear one.  This isn’t about your health, it’s about CONTROL. … Free men are not wearing them. Incidentally, studies have PROVEN that asymptomatic cases can’t spread COVID."
"Porkulus Bill Gives Billions To Foreign ‘Aid,’ Keeps MS-13 Pipeline Open And Millions For ‘Former Presidents’",22 DEC 2020,10325,"Yesterday, Americans were finally given a glimpse of the pork-stuffed spending included in the supposed COVID ‘stimulus’ package… and the billions of dollars that are being funneled to democrats has many people furious. Oh yeah… Congress also got huge raises. Just The News reported: The $900 billion compromise bill heading toward passage on Capitol Hill includes a $600 check for Americans struggling to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic, an amount that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls “significant.” [Significant for us slaves, that is… she, of course, owns a freezer that costs more than many people make in a year.] Under the last stimulus bill passed by Congress in March, more than 150 million Americans received $1,200 payments as the government returned nearly $270 billion to Americans. In a short statement on the House floor on Monday, Pelosi took the opportunity to bash President Trump as she discussed the new relief checks. “I would like them bigger, but they are significant, and they will be going out soon,” Pelosi said. “The president may insist on having his name on the check. But make no mistake, those checks are from the American people. The American people’s name should be on that check, no individual. Pelosi, it’s worth noting, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with a net worth estimated at more than $100 million (she makes $223,000 a year in salary). And for the record, when Trump signed into law tax cuts that prompted numerous businesses to give $1,000-$2,5000 bonuses to millions of workers, Pelosi called that amount “crumbs.” You can’t make this up…Pelosi in 2018 called $1,000+ bonuses being handed out by businesses after tax cuts “crumbs” and “pathetic” but just called the $600 stimulus checks “significant.” pic.twitter.com/vVaizbk6O1— Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) December 21, 2020 When the first stimulus bill passed, the payments began about two weeks after the legislation was approved. More than 81 million payments totaling more than $147 billion were disbursed within weeks, all through electronic transfers to recipients’ bank accounts, according to the Government Accountability Office. In August, as lawmakers continued to debate more direct payments to Americans, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the federal government could roll out new checks the week after Congress passed a bill. “We did it the first time — I can get out 50 million payments really quickly, a lot of it into people’s direct accounts,” Mnuchin told reporters then. … Social media had a field day with the paltry amount for Americans included in the compromise bill.

Another said: “What are you going to do with your $600 stimulus check? Pay 1 of your 10 overdue bills – buy barely 2 weeks worth of groceries – pay a quarter of your rent – ???? – use it to wipe your tears.” What are you going to do with your $600 stimulus check?  – pay 1 of your 10 overdue bills – buy barely 2 weeks worth of groceries – pay a quarter of your rent – ???? – use it to wipe your tears— Jordan Lancaster (@jordylancaster) December 21, 2020 But there’s more… the bill also keeps open the MS-13 pipeline to the U.S. and ‘limits’ border protections. Breitbart News reported: A relief package for Americans during the Chinese coronavirus crisis includes a continuation of a de facto amnesty pipeline for illegal aliens while placing limits on where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can construct United States-Mexico border wall. First enacted at the beginning of 2019, Congress is looking to continue a de facto amnesty pipeline that can be readily used by members of the violent MS-13 Gang which recruits Central American teenagers. In a year-end spending bill, meant to be relief for struggling Americans, lawmakers have included provisions that ban the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency from deporting any illegal aliens who are living in households with or are related to “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UACs) who quickly get released to relatives after arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Under the provisions, ICE agents cannot detain, deport, or even refer for deportation illegal aliens who are “a sponsor, potential sponsor, or member of a household of a sponsor or potential sponsor” to a UAC so long as they have not been convicted of a felony. The provisions provide a legal shield, or de facto amnesty, to all illegal aliens claiming to be part of a household that is sponsoring a UAC, even those affiliated with the MS-13 gang. At the same time, the bill provides nearly $1.4 billion to construct 56 miles of border wall along the southern border. The money comes with limitations, though, that bans DHS from constructing wall within: In November, more than 67,000 border crossers were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, including nearly 4,500 UACs. Another more than 58,500 border crossers were single adults. The UAC program is widely used by the MS-13 gang to import illegal alien members into the U.S. Annually, about 22,000 potential recruits for the MS-13 gang are resettled throughout the country by the federal government. The MS-13 gang originated in El Salvador and has used the U.S. immigration system to slowly build up its membership Breitbart News also reported on the billions in foreign aid being shelled out: American taxpayers still reeling from coronavirus lockdowns will be shelling out billions to foreign countries if Congress passes a $2.3 trillion spending bill unveiled Monday. The 5,593 page budget-busting bill was posted online Monday afternoon, only hours before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a vote would be held. For some countries, Christmas came early: Rep. Andy Biggs slammed the bill before the details even emerged: We still don’t have text yet for this massive spending bill, and we’ll likely be expected to vote on it later today. Just another bill we have to pass before the American people discover all the goodies that special interests jammed into it over the past week. https://t.co/l2A6ygSEPF — Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) December 21, 2020 “Just another bill we have to pass before the American people discover all the goodies that special interests jammed into it over the past week,” he wrote.

"Study: Asymptomatic Spread Of COVID Is False, 10 Million People “Close Contact” Zero Transmissions",21 DEC 2020,5621,"Yet again, scientific studies have proven that the lies being told about COVID are just that…. Lies. In a new study, researchers learned that positive patients were not able to transmit the virus to others, as long as they were without symptoms. Conservative Treehouse reported: An interesting article from the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) is gaining increased attention as questions about asymptomatic spread of COVID-19, the baseline for all COVID mitigation, is being reconciled with the latest tracing data. In essence, the larger question being asked is: can people without coronavirus symptoms spread the COVID-19 virus?  This question is at the heart of all current COVID mitigation efforts.  If there is no asymptomatic spread then what is all of this mask wearing nonsense and shut-down mandates all about? A research paper published on November 20th highlights a case study of almost 10 million people in China.  What the study found was there were 300 cases of Coronavirus in the population being carried without any symptoms at all.  So the scientists then tracked the asymptomatic carriers.  The contact tracing of 1,174 “close contacts” with the asymptomatic carriers showed ZERO transmission.  Not a few, not a couple, but zero -none-  not a single transmission of Coronavirus from a person without symptoms. The conclusion is not that asymptomatic spread is rare or that the science is uncertain. The study revealed something that hardly ever happens in these kinds of studies. There was not one documented case. Forget rare. Forget even Fauci’s previous suggestion that asymptomatic transmission exists but not does drive the spread. Replace all that with: never. At least not in this study for 10,000,000. [STUDY] … Stringent COVID-19 control measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23 and April 8, 2020. Estimates of the prevalence of infection following the release of restrictions could inform post-lockdown pandemic management. Here, we describe a city-wide SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening programme between May 14 and June 1, 2020 in Wuhan. All city residents aged six years or older were eligible and 9,899,828 (92.9%) participated. No new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270–0.339/10,000) were identified. There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases. 107 of 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients tested positive again (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423–0.574%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was therefore very low five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown. One might suppose that this would be huge news. It would allow us to open up everything immediately. With the whole basis for post-curve-flattening lockdowns crumbled, we could go back to living a normal life. The fear could evaporate. We could take comfort in our normal intuition that healthy people can get out and about with no risk to others. We could take off our masks. We could go to movies and sports events. … We keep hearing about how we should follow the science. The claim is tired by now. We know what’s really happening. The lockdown lobby ignores whatever contradicts their narrative, preferring unverified anecdotes over an actual scientific study of 10 million residents in what was the world’s first major hotspot for the disease we are trying to manage. You would expect this study to be massive international news. So far as I can tell, it is being ignored. [More] In essence, what the study of 10 million people confirmed is what many people, doctors, scientists and World Health Organization already suspected. Like the common cold and flu when a person is infected with the virus they are only infecting others when they have symptoms: cold, runny nose, coughing, aching, sneezing, fever, congestion etc; hence, when a person has an illness they should isolate to not spread the virus. However, when a person has no external symptoms of the virus, just like the cold and flu, they are not a risk of transmitting the virus to others. ♦ This is a major issue with massive ramifications because all of the current COVID-19 mitigation effort is based on the principle that people can carry and spread the virus while having no idea they have it, and no symptoms. If asymptomatic transmission is not happening, and it appears with scientific certainty it is not, then all of the current lock-down regulations, mask wearing requirements and social distancing rules/decrees are based on a complete fallacy of false assumptions. The asymptomatic case study published in November affirms the earlier reporting from the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is only known to transmit from people who are showing symptoms of the virus.  In June of 2020, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said transmission of the coronavirus by people who aren’t showing symptoms is “very rare.” As you can see from the video explanation, in June 2020 Ms. Kerkhove could not identify a single study or case that was traced to asymptomatic spread; but scientists still thought it might be possible so she -and others- kept using the “very rare” terminology. However, with the latest information and a far more lengthy timeline to study the disease, the cumulative 2020 data shows “very rare” actually means “never”, asymptomatic spread just doesn’t happen – EVER. So why is the entire world engaged in COVID-19 mitigation processes to block the transmission of a virus that has never, not even once, been identified as occurring?"
"Lab Results Show Toothpaste, Mouthwash Neutralizes 99.9% Of COVID Virus",21 DEC 2020,4292,"Apparently, there’s yet another reason to practice good dental hygiene. Certain toothpastes and mouthwashes neutralize 99.9 percent of the virus. Philstar reported:   Laboratory studies show that toothpastes containing zinc or stannous and mouthwash formulas with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) neutralize the virus that causes COVID-19 by 99.9%. The studies are part of a Colgate research program that includes clinical studies among infected people to assess the efficacy of oral care products in reducing the amount of the virus in the mouth, potentially slowing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. In the laboratory studies—the first to include toothpaste—Colgate Total and Meridol toothpastes neutralized 99.9% of the virus after two minutes of contact. Colgate Plax and Colgate Total mouthwashes were similarly effective after 30 seconds. The studies, completed in October, were conducted in partnership with Rutgers New Jersey Medical School’s (NJMS) Public Health Research Institute and Regional Biosafety Laboratories. The results suggest that some toothpastes and mouthwashes may help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by temporarily reducing the amount of virus in the mouth. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’re at the early stages of our clinical investigations, but our preliminary laboratory and clinical results are very promising,” said Dr. Maria Ryan, Colgate’s chief clinical officer. “While brushing and rinsing are not a treatment or a way to fully protect an individual from infection, they may help to reduce transmission and slow the spread of the virus, supplementing the benefit we get from wearing masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing.” she added [FYI, no studies have proven that masks do a darn thing.] Dr. David Alland, Chief of Infectious Diseases and Director of the Center for COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness, who led the Rutgers NJMS study along with colleagues Drs. Pradeep Kumar and Riccardo Russo said: “Given that saliva can contain amounts of virus that are comparable to that found in the nose and throat, it seems likely that SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the mouth contributes to disease transmission, especially in persons with asymptomatic COVID-19, who are not coughing. This suggests that reducing virus in the mouth could help prevent transmission during the time that oral care products are active.” [Which, new studies show isn’t transmissible to others if the person is asymptomatic.] Concurrent to the laboratory study, Colgate sponsored a clinical study involving some 50 hospitalized subjects with COVID-19.  This study demonstrated the ability of Colgate Total (with CPC and zinc), Colgate Peroxyl, and Colgate PerioGard mouthwashes to substantially reduce the amount of the virus in the mouth temporarily. The researchers plan to share their findings in December. Additional Colgate-supported clinical research studies on toothpaste and mouthwashes are in early stages at Rutgers, the Albert Einstein Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Adams School of Dentistry, with some 260 people with COVID-19 participating in these studies. “Colgate is collaborating with numerous investigators throughout the globe to conduct clinical research to explore the potential of oral care products to reduce oral viral loads as a risk reduction strategy,” Dr. Ryan said. “We think oral care has a role to play in fighting the global pandemic, alongside other preventive measures.” Dr. Mark Wolff, Morton Amsterdam Dean of Penn Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania said that: “With this pandemic, the more we understand about the virus, the more effective we can be in fighting it, so I am excited to see the impressive research program Colgate has undertaken,” “We need to continue to take the precautions recommended by health authorities, and with these studies we may demonstrate an additional way to address the transmission of disease among people in close contact, particularly in dental practice. That would be an important advance.” he added"
"COVID Relief Bill Done: Provides Billions For Democrats, Mere $600 For Starving Families",21 DEC 2020,10336,"Apparently, staring Americans are supposed to be thankful to our masters that they decided to give us a whopping $600 check, while they themselves continued to collect tens of thousands of dollars each month, and while they give themselves and their democrat cities billions. Seriously. This ‘agreement’ is a slush fund for failing democrats to dip their hands in at will… it’s pathetic. Just The News reported: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Sunday evening a final deal on a long-awaited COVID-19 relief and stimulus package totaling about $900 billion. The House and Senate could vote to approve the package as early as Monday, and President Trump is expected to sign it. “More help is on the way,” McConnell, R-Ky., said when he announced the deal on the Senate floor. Added House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “We are going to crush the virus and put money in the pockets of the American people.” Nancy Pelosi gets her very own Air Force Gulfstream V to fly as much as she wants…. This plane costs approximately $7,100/hour to operate. That means she spends $600 every 5 minutes she's in the air, NOT including her $102,000 per year allowance for in air food and booze. FACT pic.twitter.com/5ca6OjmJCK — President-Elect Wild Bill  (@wmmII88) December 21, 2020 The two chambers passed a one-day extension of federal funding Sunday night to ensure the government stayed open until the bill is passed. Here are highlights of the deal, according to various summaries released by lawmakers late Sunday: Individual stimulus checks:  The bill offers up to $600 stimulus checks per person, including adults and children, for families making less than $99,000 annually. The payment begins decreasing for those above $75,000 in annual income. Business relief: The bill includes more than $284 billion for more forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans. The bill expands eligibility for nonprofit organizations and news outlets, and lets churches and faith-based organizations qualify. Jobless benefits: Unemployment benefits of up to $300 per week will be extended at least through March 14. Tax relief: Businesses that received PPP loans and had them forgiven will be allowed to deduct the costs covered by those loans on their federal taxes. The bill also will provide a White House-backed tax break for corporate meal expenses. COVID vaccine assistance: The bill sets aside $48 billion for COVID health care needs, including $20 billion to make vaccines available for free to those who need it. Entertainment industry aid: The legislation will provide $15 billion for independent movie theaters and cultural institutions. Eviction moratorium: The legislation extends until Jan. 31 a moratorium on evictions that was slated to expire at the end of the year. Rent Assistance: The deal provides $25 billion in emergency assistance to renters. Education funding: There is $82 billion set aside for colleges and schools to fund AC and heating repair and retrofitting to reduce coronavirus risks and reopen classrooms. Child Care Aid. The deal provides $10 billion for child care assistance. But, that’s not all… Stimulus package is trash.

According to recent reports (which seem accurate) congress has just agreed to the largest bailout and budget combined spending bill in history.  The seriously sketchy COVID “relief” (insert term “bailout”) package is $900 billion, and they are throwing in a $1.4 Trillion omnibus spending bill… This is literally identical to what Pelosi and crew did when Obama was coming into office in 2007. ~ The total combined package is over $2.3 TRILLION ~ (Via Politico) […] House and Senate are now on a glide path to approve the aid package and its partner, a $1.4 trillion bill funding the government through September. Though the Fed feud dominated the past 48 hours, the crux of the package remains the same: a $300 boost in weekly unemployment benefits, $600 relief checks for adultsand children, more than $300 billion for small business aid and huge pots of money for schools, hospitals and vaccine distribution. (read more) Butter my buns and call me a biscuit, how can people not see what is going on here?  2020 is an exact replica of 2007 with COVID taking the place of TARP.  And… to top it all off, we have omnibus spending bills replacing the federal budgetary process all over again. FML.   Heck, I’m just going to repeat right here what I already predicted three weeks ago… it has unfolded EXACTLY as we suspected it would… The audacity of the elites who run both wings of the UniParty is jaw-dropping. [December 5, 2020] The COVID-19 narrative becomes a tool to achieve a variety of objectives … Without COVID as a tool the manufactured process is more difficult. The ‘never let a crisis go to waste‘ strategy includes the creation of a crisis. Why? – Why all of this effort?… why such extremes?… why would blue state governors willingly destroy their economy?….  Follow the money, it’s always about the money. The global ideology is worthless without money.   Wall Street’s Rick Santelli knows, he’s watching the second deployment of an identical playbook. So when your friends ask why, let’s talk about ‘why‘. The response to the opportunity of the financial crisis of 2007/2008 was all about using the housing market collapse to create a financial mechanism to bail-out Blue Team members. TARP, Auto-bailouts, QE1, QE2 and the stimulus packages were specifically directed to the controlled crony capitalists who funded the rise of the previous tool, Barack Obama. In 2008 the orcs were deployed.  Beyond the Wall Street crowd, the SEIU, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, NEA were some of the more visible politically activist beneficiaries.  There was a massive hole in the U.S. economy and all the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds were specifically targeted to ensure the Blue Team did not suffer. Winners and losers were selected.  Overall Main Street didn’t get a dime. In 2020, we are seeing the exact same operational execution around COVID-19.  This time the crisis is a virus and the planned primary beneficiaries are the Blue Team states and their collapsing and unstable financial mechanisms. The American electorate (writ large) would never support targeted taxpayer funded  bailouts to Blue State beneficiaries.  As a consequence, the crisis needs to hit Main Street so that public support for massive bailouts can be accepted. Nancy Pelosi sets up the proposal, takes the accounting of the Blue Team needs, and sits down with inside party club members to organize the funding mechanisms. Obviously, all of this big picture outcome is contingent upon successful execution of President Trump’s removal… hence, the firm-reliance on election fraud.  The transparency of the fraud needs to be obfuscated, denied and ridiculed; that’s where the media come in. Meanwhile, Blue State teams work earnestly to create a worsening financial crisis for the American electorate, the workers and business owners.  Shutting down the economy is part of a coordinated effort. When do both wings of the UniParty bird most visibly flap in unison? ANSWER: When they get to the part of the playbook where ‘their tribe’ starts positioning for the trough. Yes, COVID-19 as a weapon has many benefits… including the purposefully convenient stopping of assemblies, crowds and visible public opposition as the larger schemes are deployed hastily. BIG TECH steps-in to assist the goal of isolating the electorate by shutting down voices and keeping people isolated from larger community understanding.  Communication lines are cut, as they would be in any war strategy.  Dividing people has many benefits. As soon as enough pressure is applied to Main Street, the electorate get desperate. There will be an outcry for help and that is where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is waiting in the wings with the previously constructed bailout package that the American people will now be more apt to support.  Opposition voices will be framed as heartless; the media will immediately jump into action; and we go right into that cycle were fearful people do not stop to recognize the financial strategy as it is carried out. The Blue Team state bailout will come at the top of a massive 2020 COVID federal spending package. As with the previous 2009 spending package, it will be gift-wrapped in paper to appear like Main Street is a beneficiary… However, just like the ARRA, there will be no ‘shovel ready jobs‘ saved or created.  It is all a ruse for a transfer of taxpayer wealth. The weaponization of COVID is the ongoing crisis that will facilitate the government solutions.  As the American people resist the bait represented by the COVID crisis, those who need to weaponize it will keep turning up the pressure. That pressure will continue until the American people can no longer take it and will accept the solution.  We are watching deployment of an identical playbook used previously to bail-out Wall Street, Big Banks and political benefactors/beneficiaries in 2009. …And the great reset begins. God forbid."
Texas University Medical Center Busted Showing Vaccines With Empty Syringe,18 DEC 2020,1967,"Watch as the sheeple are shown the first vaccinations at Texas University Medical Center… Whoops! There’s nothing in that syringe and the administrator doesn’t depress the plunger. After being caught faking the vaccinations on television, the medical center responded to local affiliate KTSM, which reported: Some of our viewers raised questions about video KTSM 9 News showed from Tuesday’s COVID-19 vaccine injections at University Medical Center of El Paso, specifically the second vaccine that was administered. In our video, you can see the UMC health care worker with his sleeve rolled up, but when it comes time for the injection, it appears that the person administering the shot doesn’t push down on the plunger — the plunger looks like it is already depressed. Some eagle-eyed KTSM 9 News viewers wondered if the worker received the vaccine at all. KTSM reached out to UMC — on Tuesday a UMC spokesperson maintained that all five health care workers were given full doses of the vaccine, and the hospital agreed to take a closer look at our video. UMC said its nurse received a second COVID-19 shot to eliminate doubt that he was vaccinated. [Sure… okay.] “After numerous reports emerged on social media claiming one of the five nurses receiving a
vaccination on Tuesday did not receive a full dose of vaccine, we want to remove any doubt raised that he was not fully vaccinated and further strengthen confidence in the vaccination process,” UMC said in a statement to KTSM. “The nurse in question today was vaccinated again. UMC has confirmed with the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that re-vaccinating the nurse will not cause adverse effects. The nurse will need to return after three weeks to receive his second dose.” You're a professional but don't know when you have an empty syringe? Allegedly, this is the first COVID-19 vaccinations at UMC this week. pic.twitter.com/E6yMYplnfk — Hotep Jesus (@HotepJesus) December 17, 2020"
Iowa Newspaper Fights Democrat Attempt To Forcibly Steal House Seat,17 DEC 2020,6070,"In a story that is finally gaining the publicity it needs to show just how fully corrupt democrats are, and how determined they are to illegally steal power from the American people, a race in Iowa is under the spotlight. Townhall explained how Pelosi could ‘decide’ the winner of the House race: This is a story we won’t let go of until the issue is resolved, and Democrats’ attempted steal is put down. For background, read this, this, and this, in order. The short version is as follows: In Iowa’s Second Congressional District, the Republican candidate has won and the Democratic candidate has lost. This is what the initial vote tally determined, as did the official recount. The state formally certified the result. The losing candidate chose not to appeal to Iowa’s courts. Instead, she’s appealing to the Democrat-run House of Representatives to ignore the will of voters and Iowa’s entire system in order to “get the result we need” (i.e., overturning the outcome and stealing the election): Wild video clip here.@RitaHartIA says she’s having @SpeakerPelosi decide the election result instead of Iowa courts because “there was only one way they could get the result they needed” Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found This is as antithetical to democracy as it gets #Ia02 pic.twitter.com/GC8bLMf7Tt — Calvin Moore (@CalvinMoore_) December 10, 2020 This may sound like an ill-fated, outrageous affront that will go down in flames. But Democrats have successfully done this before — in an Indiana race 36 years ago. Having failed to win on the merits, and having decided against going through proper legal channels to challenge a very close election result, Democrat Rita Hart is hoping her fellow partisans will simply “determine” that she actually “won,” declare her the victor and seat her in the new Congress. She’s also likely hoping that this is all accomplished with relatively little scrutiny. Unfortunately for Hart and her party, the audacity of this scheme is gaining attention, and many in the local press aren’t taking kindly to her outrageous gambit. The editors at the Des Moines Register, who endorsed Joe Biden for president and Theresa Greenfield for Senate (both candidates lost the Hawkeye State by fairly substantial margins), are unimpressed: In Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, Rita Hart, the loser by six votes to Mariannette Miller-Meeks, has picked a path that will inflame. Her team skipped the appeal process available through Iowa’s courts and elected to petition a U.S. House of Representatives panel to oversee a recount, before the full House decides the outcome.  It’s true that this is a legal path and that there are legitimate reasons to question the fairness of aspects of Iowa’s recount process. But even if Hart prevails, a decision that’s ultimately made by a Democratic-controlled House will forever taint her service in Congress. And the move could well backfire on her party, providing Iowa Republicans a potent rallying cry of Democratic chicanery for years in races up and down the ballot…Hart could have granted a powerful endorsement to Iowa’s election system by conceding. She should reconsider and do that now, for the sake of her party and all Iowans. Iowa doesn’t need more partisan bile infecting its politics…Meanwhile, all Iowans should welcome Miller-Meeks as a new member of Iowa’s congressional delegation. Miller-Meeks served in the U.S. Army for 24 years, where she gained her training as an ophthalmologist. She worked in private practice in Ottumwa, served as a director of the Iowa Department of Public Health and was elected as a state senator in 2018. While this editorial board disagrees with many of her policy positions, she has shown herself to be smart, hardworking and thoughtful, and we believe she will serve Iowans well. Incidentally, the DMR also endorsed Rita Hart, along with every Democrat running for Congress in the state (three of four lost). The liberal Quad City Times, which similarly endorsed Hart, has also criticized her maneuvering — albeit while pulling punches and using words like “disappointing,” “premature” and “unfortunate.” The Omaha World Herald in neighboring Nebraska has called on Hart to accept defeat: “Hart and Iowa Democrats, having chosen not to pursue a remedy in state court, should accept the certified election result. Miller-Meeks should be seated.” The Wall Street Journal editorialized on these developments as well: Democrats in Washington could overrule Iowa voters to seat a co-partisan and grow their majority. The Iowa race was decided by six votes. The counting went on for weeks as 24 counties canvassed and recanvassed over 390,000 ballots, and lawyers from both sides haggled with election officials over machine counting, ballot qualifications and voter intent. Normally this exhaustive process would end matters. Not this year. Ms. Hart’s campaign said it will bypass an Iowa court appeal and ask the Committee on House Administration to intervene. The House has final say on its Members’ elections and the Supreme Court has held that courts can’t intervene in those decisions under the Constitution’s Article I…That means the count in Iowa’s 2nd District will become a political fight rather than a legal one…Donald Trump’s unproven claims of election theft are damaging to public trust, but they’ve been going nowhere in court. Democrats could outright steal one or two House seats, while the media ignore the power grab. The way Democrats behave in these two disputed districts in the coming weeks will demonstrate the likely state of political norms in a post-Trump era. The other race the Journal piece refers to is NY-22, where last-minute “liberal voting rules helped make the race nearly impossible to resolve.” Republican Claudia Tenney is clinging to a fractional lead in the contest, which is still being adjudicated in court. Asked about the battle earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it “may end up in the House.” She insists the process would be treated as “not a political” matter. Sure."
Vaccine Update: Alaskan Worker Suffered “Anaphylactic Shock” Immediately After Injection,17 DEC 2020,1992,"An mRNA vaccine, before 2019, was a highly controversial idea. Study after study showed the problems associated with a vaccine that essentially alters a person’s DNA, but that aspect of the COVID vaccine has all but disappeared from reporting. In addition to at least four volunteers who have suffered Bell’s Palsy from the vaccine, now a health care worker in Alaska has had a severe allergic reaction to the injection, requiring hospitalization. Just the News reported: A health care worker in Alaska is reportedly doing “well” and in stable condition after suffering a serious allergic reaction minutes after receiving the new Pfizer Inc. coronavirus vaccine. The worker, who has been identified as a middle-aged woman, suffered anaphylactic shock and required hospitalization. She remains under monitoring by medical professionals. She will not be receiving the second dose of the two-jab vaccine. Two similar incidents were recorded in initial vaccine recipients in the United Kingdom last week, as the major pharmaceutical company’s distribution begins across the Western world. This is the first reported case of such an incident occurring in the United States. It will reportedly not impact the distribution plan across Alaska or the rest of the country. Many people cite the fact that COVID has a current survival rate of 99 percent for most people, and don’t plan to take a vaccine that has a 95 percent effectiveness and is connected to Bill Gates, whose ‘miracle’ vaccines in third world countries have sterilized women (against their knowledge) and killed and paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children. Moreover, they point to the information that the vaccine contains materials harvested from aborted fetuses, and some of the more wild rumors that claim that it injects ‘DNA’ particles that prevent salvation. Regardless of the rumors, the fact that it apparently can cause serious and potentially deadly results in some individuals is cause enough for many to be concerned.  "
Wisconsin Supreme Court Rules “Exemptions” Can’t Be Counted As Biden Elector Caught In Illegal Act,15 DEC 2020,4986,"Yesterday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued two rulings. One, denying the president’s lawsuit, and the other, a slap to the leftist controlled governor who issued an illegal change to the voting requirements. Basically, that second ruling could lead to over 200,000 votes being disqualified. However, the real kicker was the Biden elector who brazenly broke the law and lied to the state about her “confinement.” Just The News reported: The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Monday that state and local election officials erred when they gave blanket permission allowing voters to declare themselves homebound and skip voter ID requirements in the 2020 election, potentially opening the door for Republicans to challenge tens of thousands of ballots. In a case challenging the practice in Dane County, one of Wisconsin’s large urban center around the city of Madison, the state’s highest court ruled only those voters whose “own age, physical illness or infirmity” makes them homebound could declare themselves “indefinitely confined” and avoid complying with a requirement for photo ID. The mere existence of a COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown orders was not sufficient under Wisconsin law for all persons to skip the voter ID requirements to seek to vote absentee, the justices ruled. “We conclude that both the contention that electors qualify as indefinitely confined solely as the result of the COVID19 pandemic and the declared public health emergency and the contention that Wis. Stat. § 6.86(2)(a) could be used for those who ‘have trouble presenting a valid ID’ are erroneous because those reasons do not come within the statutory criteria,” the court ruled. WisSupCrtIndefinetlyConfinedRuling.pdf In so doing, the court ruled that local officials like Dane County and Gov. Tony Evers did not have legal authority to exempt all voters to get an absentee ballot without an ID. Evers had issued an executive order earlier this year. “We conclude that [Evers’] Emergency Order #12 did not render all Wisconsin electors ‘indefinitely confined,’ thereby obviating the requirement of a valid photo identification to obtain an absentee ballot,” the majority ruling concluded. The court filings indicated nearly 200,000 voters declared themselves permanently confined in the state’s spring primary, a marked rise over prior years, and even more did so in the general election. The ruling opens the door for Republicans to potentially challenge those votes if it can be shown the voters weren’t sick or elderly as required by the law. One of those invalid votes came from a Biden elector. The Gateway Pundit reported: One of Joe Biden’s Wisconsin electors falsely claimed she was “indefinitely confined” to her home leading up to Election Day, but pictures on her social media show her out and about campaigning. Wisconsin Democrat state senator Patricia Schachtner will cast one of her state’s 10 electoral votes for Joe Biden on Monday. However, Schachtner claimed to the Wisconsin Elections Commission in a signed statement that she was “indefinitely confined” to her home due to Covid and therefore needed a mail-in ballot. Schachtner posted Facebook photos of her and her husband (who also claimed to be indefinitely confined) outside enjoying themselves. It’s National Public Lands Day and Hunting & Fishing Day! So Joe and I are going to get out and enjoy all the wonderful natural resources that our state has to offer- I hope you will too! Posted by Patty Schachtner on Saturday, September 26, 2020 Schachtner was seen out and about campaigning with treasurer Sarah Godlewski in October. As we head into the winter months and in the middle of a pandemic, it has never been more critical that we make sure… Posted by Patty Schachtner on Thursday, October 8, 2020 Exclusive story via Newstalk1130: Schachtner and her husband Joseph appear on the Wisconsin Elections Commission list of nearly 250,000 voters who signed a statement on their mail-in ballots that they were indefinitely confined to their homes because of “because of age, physical illness or infirmity” or if they are “disabled for an indefinite period.” The Wisconsin Elections Commission’s list of indefinitely confined voters obtained by “The Dan O’Donnell Show” includes both Schachtner, a Democrat from Somerset who lost her bid for re-election last month, and her husband. Senator Schachtner has not yet responded to repeated requests for comment. Wisconsin Statute 12.13 defines election fraud as making “false statements to the municipal clerk, board of election commissioners, or any other election official whether or not under oath.” A false statement of indefinite confinement is a false statement to elections officials, and thus could be a Class I felony punishable by 3.5 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000. Additionally, making “false statements in order to obtain an absentee ballot” is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine “of not more than $1,000, not more than six-months imprisonment or both.”"
Colorado Strikes Blow For Freedom: Declares Places Of Worship “Essential”,10 DEC 2020,2579,"In a move that shouldn’t be necessary, Colorado has declared places of worship “essential.” KOAA reported: Worship leaders across the state are preparing to be able to do things a bit differently after a new public health order from the governor will allow places of worship to exceed mandated capacity limits. The order redefines worship services as essential, meaning they’re allowed to go over mandated capacity limits if they can’t perform their essential service without doing so. “I grew up in church and sensed that this is what I wanted to do,” said Vista Grande Baptist Church Pastor Chris Moore. “After college I felt that seminary would be the next step.” And now, here he is. “I’ve been a pastor for 15 years,” Moore said. The last five of those years he’s spent at Vista Grande. “On normal Sunday mornings, we would have two services, and we would have about 900 people here on campus,” he said. That’s until the pandemic forced his team to get creative. “We initially were solely online,” Moore said. Since June, they’ve been able to have limited capacity services in-person per state guidelines. “We have done our best from the beginning to follow the guidelines given to us,” he said. Monday evening, John Plastow, a pastor at Academy Christian Church, joined a conference call with Governor Polis and other faith leaders, which resulted in the new guidelines. “They’re now classifying worship events as an essential service,” Plastow said. That classification came in the form of the public health order from the governor. “But it does just remove the legal restriction of capping the attendance,” Plastow said. That includes attendance at not only regular worship services, but also things like weddings and funerals. With the loosened restrictions still come some requirements. At weddings and funerals, the state still requires people to wear masks indoors and keep six feet apart. It all comes after the U.S. Supreme Court issued an injunction last week blocking the state of New York from restricting capacities at worship services. “It gave us some weight to what we’re trying to do here,” Plastow said. Both he and Moore say, even though they don’t have to, they’ll keep their existing safety measures in place. “We want to be good law abiding citizens and we believe the Bible is pretty clear that we’re supposed to be good law abiding citizens,” Moore said. For him, it’s more about perspective. “I would argue that it’s not really the government’s job to decide if a church is essential or non-essential, this is just a first amendment right,” he said."
NY Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Force Vaccinate If Residents Won’t Submit,10 DEC 2020,3552,"Apparently, for the ‘good’ of society, if enough people in New York won’t willingly submit to taking a vaccine that is completely unnecessary for the large majority of the population, then lawmakers will have to force citizens to take it…. For their own good. Just The News reported: New York lawmaker is proposing legislation to make a COVID-19 vaccine mandatory if too few residents voluntarily get the immunization. Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who represents parts of Manhattan’s West Side, has introduced a bill that would require the state to “safely and effectively” distribute an FDA-approved vaccine “in accordance with the department [of health]’s COVID-19 vaccination administration program,” according to the language of the legislation. The bill states, “If public health officials determine that residents of the state are not developing sufficient immunity from COVID-19, the department shall mandate vaccination for all individuals.” The text of the bill also states, in part, “if public health officials determine that residents of the state are not developing sufficient immunity from COVID-19, the department shall mandate vaccination for all individuals or groups of individuals who, as shown by clinical data, are proven to be safe to receive such vaccine.” However, the bill does not define “sufficient immunity,” so public health officials would presumably decide whether that benchmark has been met. A memo with the bill states: “While steps have been taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19, epidemiologists and public health experts have concluded that a vaccine will be necessary to develop herd immunity and ultimately stop the spread of the disease. The state must make efforts to promote vaccination and ensure that a high enough percentage of the population is vaccinated against COVID-19 to develop sufficient immunity.” Still, the bill allows residents with underlying health conditions to opt out. “Any individual who has received a medical exemption from a licensed medical professional shall not be mandated to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and shall be excluded from the requirements of this section,” the bill states. “It’s a protective health measure,” Rosenthal told WGRZ-TV. “It’s to ensure that our residents are safe and protected against further spread.” She added: “the concept of herd immunity is very important, and not everyone will have to get the vaccination if a certain threshold of the population has gotten it.” She said the threshold would have to be 75%-80% and added that she thinks enough people will be voluntarily to take the vaccine to reach that. “However, there is the possibility that we don’t and in that event to protect the public health, the department of health of the state can then say that we need people to get the vaccination,” Rosenthal said. A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee said earlier this week said the vaccine by Pfizer and BioNTech meets safety and efficacy standard, which is expected within days to result in full FDA emergency-use approval. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Dec. 2 voted to direct that healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities will be the first to get the shots in the initial rollout – once federal regulators authorize use of a vaccine. The recommendation was approved CDC Director Robert Redfield, but governors will eventually have the final say on who gets the vaccine first. The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Dec. 17 to review data from the two companies."
"FDA Claims Vaccine Is Safe, But Second Shot ‘Side Effects’ Stun As Bell’s Palsy Reported",9 DEC 2020,6898,"The COVID vaccine… a ‘treatment’ that alters a person’s DNA, for a virus that has a 99% recovery rate… may not be as safe as you think. In addition to some very strong ‘side effects’ from the second dose, a few people have developed Bell’s palsy, but the spontaneous development of that paralysis is not being connected to the vaccine. CNBC reported: The Pfizer–BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is both safe and effective, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In a report released Tuesday morning, the FDA indicated that it could greenlight the country’s first Covid-19 inoculation within days. If Pfizer’s shot is granted an emergency use authorization, or EUA, the immunizations — which are administered in two doses about three weeks apart — could start as soon as next week. Many people are now wondering whether this will be just like getting the flu vaccine. The short answer is: No, not really. One Pfizer trial participant told CNBC that after the second shot, he woke up with chills, shaking so hard he cracked a tooth. “It hurt to even just lay in my bed sheet,” he said. Others experienced headaches and fatigue. The FDA said that while side effects of the Pfizer vaccine are common, there are “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA.” The Pfizer vaccine is one of four U.S.-backed candidates in phase three trials. Next up is one from U.S. biotech firm Moderna, which has also submitted its EUA application. Both companies have said that taking their vaccines could result in side effects similar to mild Covid symptoms. Think muscle pain, chills and a headache. When trial participant Yasir Batalvi first read Moderna’s 22-page consent form warning of side effects ranging from nothing at all to death, he felt pretty worried, he told CNBC. “You have to keep in mind, I joined the trial when we didn’t know it was going to be a safe vaccine,” said Batalvi, a recent college graduate living in Boston. The 24-year-old said that when he got the first injection in mid-October, it felt just like a flu shot. “I experienced stiffness and pain in my left arm where I had gotten the shot, but it was mild,” he explained. “By that evening, I didn’t want to move my arm above my shoulder, but it was localized, and it disappeared by the next day.” The second dose was a different story. “After the injection, I had the same side effects as the first: localized pain and stiffness, but it was a little bit worse. My arm got sore faster, and by the time I got home, I started feeling fatigued and like anyone would feel if they were coming down with the flu,” said Batalvi. More significant symptoms presented that evening. “I developed a low-grade fever and had chills,” he said. “That evening was rough.” After a restless night, he called the study doctors, who reassured him it was a normal reaction and no cause for concern. By that afternoon, Batalvi said, he felt like himself again. Moderna stopped testing the highest dose of its vaccine during the trial because of the number of reports of severe adverse reactions. As for any long-term effects, Batalvi isn’t giving it much thought. “I’m not too concerned,” he said. “We know from vaccination trials that any adverse events mostly show up in the first couple of months.” How an mRNA vaccine works Front-runners Pfizer and Moderna built their candidates with a new kind of technology that’s never before been licensed in the U.S. Messenger RNA vaccines, called mRNA for short, aren’t like your normal flu vaccine. Typically, a vaccine puts a weakened or inactivated virus into our bodies to trigger an immune response, which then produces antibodies. Those antibodies are what ultimately protect us from getting infected if we ever encounter the real thing. An mRNA vaccine, on the other hand, is essentially just a piece of genetic code that contains instructions for our body. The mRNA tells our cells to make a protein — the same protein that is the spike on top of the actual coronavirus. This is what triggers the immune response in these types of vaccines. [Basically, it ALTERS YOUR DNA!] So even though some trial participants reported Covid-like symptoms, it is impossible to contract the coronavirus from the vaccine, because the mRNA vaccines that Pfizer and Moderna are making don’t use the live virus. The Daily Mail reported: Four people who got Pfizer‘s coronavirus vaccine in the firm’s trial developed Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, according to U.S. regulators’ report on the shot. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators said there wasn’t any clear way that the vaccine caused Bell’s palsy, but warned that doctors should watch for the alarming side effect and Pfizer should continue to keep tab on how many people it strikes. No one knows what exactly causes Bell’s palsy, which resolves on its own most of the time. This isn’t the first time it’s been linked to vaccines, but scientists have ultimately ruled that shots did not trigger Bell’s in all but one case – a Swiss flu vaccine that was sold during the 2001-2002 flu season there, then promptly taken off the market. So far, the FDA said that the number of Bell’s palsy cases seen in the Pfizer vaccine trial was ‘consistent with the background frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group that is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time,’ but will keep a close watch on future cases. Four people who received the real shot in Pfizer’s trial of its coronavirus vaccine developed a form of temporary facial paralysis known as Bell’s policy, new data from the firm and the FDA published ahead of regulators’ Thursday approval meeting revealed. Pictured: a UK trial participant gets Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine … Bell’s palsy typically resolves on its own but can cause one side of the face to droop rather alarmingly for weeks. It’s exact cause is unknown but it’s more common among pregnant women, people with diabetes and those with upper respiratory infections The four cases of Bell’s palsy were the only side effect that the FDA saw as ‘imbalanced’ with more occurring in the vaccine group than the placebo group, and fewer than 0.5 percent of the trial participants had serious side effects. Among the four people who developed Bell’s palsy, one saw facial paralysis or weakness within three days after they received the shot. As a respiratory infection, it’s possible that COVID-19 itself could be a risk factor for Bell’s palsy. Facial palsy was reported in three Brazilian COVID-19 patients, at least one person in China, a pregnant woman in Portugal, and in a number of Indian patients. … Enough concern has been expressed that scientists have conducted a number of studies to try to work out if these shots really could cause temporary palsy."
Inaugural Committee Votes “No” To Acknowledge Biden As President Elect,9 DEC 2020,3264,"Although many Americans falsely assume that Joe Biden is the president elect, that is not the case. The media doesn’t get to determine that, and neither does a political party. That’s congress’s job. But interestingly, in their desperate push to achieve the largest rigged election in history, democrats had a brilliant idea to “vote” for a resolution in the Inaugural Committee that “acknowledged” Joe Biden as President Elect. It failed. The Epoch Times reported: The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies voted down a resolution to acknowledge Joe Biden as the president-elect as President Donald Trump and other Republicans continue lawsuits challenging the results of the Nov. 3 election, according to several members of the bipartisan panel. There are three Republicans and three Democrats on the panel from both the House and Senate, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) are also on the committee. Republicans said they made the decision because there are election-related processes that need to play out first before a president-elect can be decided. “It is not the job of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to get ahead of the electoral process and decide who we are inaugurating,” Blunt said in a statement afterward. “The JCCIC [Inaugural Committee] is facing the challenge of planning safe Inaugural Ceremonies during a global pandemic. I would hope that, going forward, the members of the JCCIC would adhere to the committee’s long-standing tradition of bipartisan cooperation and focus on the task at hand.” McConnell, speaking to reporters, noted that the Electoral College meets to elect the president on Dec. 14. “This has become a weekly ritual. The Electoral College is going to meet on the 14th and cast a vote, and we’re going to have a swearing in of the next president on the 20th of January,” McConnell said at the Capitol. Hoyer issued a statement after the resolution was rejected, criticizing the GOP’s position. “The extent to which Republicans are refusing to accept the outcome of the election and recognize Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next President and Vice President is astounding,” Hoyer told media outlets after the vote, confirming Biden wasn’t acknowledged. Hoyer told The Hill that GOP lawmakers have a “deference to President Trump’s post-election temper tantrums.” But he said the Inauguration Committee agreed on limiting public participation during the Jan. 20 inauguration event due to the CCP virus. “I think there was a consensus that we’re going to limit far beyond what we’d like to do,” he told reporters. Biden has declared victory in the election but Trump and other Republicans are contesting election results in court. The Epoch Times isn’t calling the race at this time. According to the text of the resolution that was shot down, it had proposed that the public be notified “in coordination with the Biden Presidential Inaugural Committee and public health experts” as “we observe this transition of power.” So, the public will NOT be notified of that lie."
Seattle Law Would Legalize ‘Poor’ Crimes: “Basic Need” Is Get Out of Jail Free,8 DEC 2020,4824,"Although Seattle has become the land of progressive insanity, allowing an actual military-style insurrection to flourish, that’s apparently not good enough for the liberals who control the town. A new measure would allow anyone who’s poor enough to skirt charges for robbing others. And Magazine reported: Once upon a time Seattle was one of my favorite cities in the world. Situated as it is beside the beauty of Puget Sound with the Cascades in one direction and the majesty of the Olympic Peninsula in the other, it is placed in one of the world’s most beautiful locations. The climate also is enviable, never too cold, never too hot, perhaps a bit damp but nothing compared to the nearby rain forests. Wandering through Pike Place market was a magical experience then. Not anymore. Seattle has gone mad, lost to the inherently irrational “progressive” agenda that is raging across the United States. Nothing makes sense. Nothing is logical. It is as if the madness of Alice’s Wonderland had come to life all around you. Witness the ongoing consideration of a bill by the Seattle City Council, which will make it impossible for the city to prosecute “crimes of poverty.” If approved, the ordinance would excuse and dismiss, effectively legalizing, misdemeanor crimes committed by any offender who could show: So, if this ordinance becomes law in Seattle and you are a junkie you will be handed what is, in effect, a get out of jail free card for any misdemeanor you desire to commit. If you are clean and straight and sober but don’t have a job and decide you need to walk out of the local supermarket with an armload of steaks and a case of Coke, you skate. And, if you have a mental disorder all bets are off. Commit whatever misdemeanor you want. Scott Lindsay, the former public safety advisor for Seattle, had this to say. “I’m not aware of any legislation like this anywhere in the United States (or) even globally. All cities have criminal codes to protect their citizens from criminal acts. This would essentially create a legal loophole that swallows all those codes and creates a green light for crime.” “If you don’t feel very protected right now, this would wipe out almost all remaining protections that we have,” Lindsay added. “This would absolutely open the floodgates for crime in Seattle, even worse than what we often currently struggle with,” Lindsay said. “It’s basically a blank check for anybody committing theft, assault, harassment (and) trespass to continue without disruption from our criminal justice system.” Christopher Rufo, writing for the Seattle City Journal, had this to add about the impact of this proposed ordinance. “On a practical level, if this ordinance becomes law, it will effectively legalize an entire spectrum of misdemeanor crimes, including theft, assault, harassment, drug possession, property destruction, and indecent exposure… The impact of this measure would be enormous. In 2019, the Seattle Police Department reported 25,993 thefts, 8,442 assaults, 6,430 property offenses, 4,194 frauds, 3,910 trespasses, and 1,640 narcotics violations—representing 72 percent of all reported crimes. If the ordinance passes, nearly all these crimes would be permitted under law.” In short, this is not an attempt to work around the edges of the criminal justice system. This is a proposal to gut it and effectively legalize most of the crime that occurs in the city. The proponents of this measure believe that the “system” is inherently racist and oppressive. They don’t think men and women who prey on law abiding citizens are criminals who deserve punishment. They don’t even think of them as drunks or drug addicts who should be put in rehab and forced to deal with their substance abuse problems. No, these individuals are victims. They have been abused by an evil capitalist, democratic system and they have been forced to engage in criminal activity by that system. The man who knocks you down and takes your purse is not a thug. He is a hero fighting back against the “man.” The guy exposing himself and urinating on the sidewalk is not a drunk or even someone who needs to be compelled to undergo treatment for a mental health disorder. He is, instead, at the vanguard of the new society we must build. A rational person would say this is madness. He or she would predict that the city will rapidly become unlivable, not that it is not already well on its way. He or she might also note that empowering criminals, the mentally ill and those whose lives are ruled by drugs to steal from convenience stores, expose themselves in public and assault fellow citizens is hardly a prescription for moving those people off the street and turning them into productive members of society. It doesn’t matter. Rationality has no place in this. This is Seattle. Welcome to crazy town."
Defense Dept. Issues COVID “Vaccination Record Card” And Kits For National “Registration”,5 DEC 2020,3096,"This week, the Department of Defense issues images of the planned COVID vaccination record and kits, to be used as a national registry. The move has caused many people to scratch their heads over this massive move for a virus with a survival rate of nearly 100%. They ask, why wait? Why not just go ahead and issue barcodes for everyone’s forehead and hands… you know, so they can buy and sell. Zero Hedge reported: On Wednesday the Department of Defense released the first images of a COVID-19 vaccination record card as well as vaccination kits, according to CNN. “Everyone will be issued a written card that they can put in their wallet that will tell them what they had and when their next dose is due,” says Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition. “Let’s do the simple, easy thing first. Everyone’s going to get that.” What’s more, vaccination clinics will also report to their state immunization registries which vaccine was given so that third parties can verify one’s vaccination status regardless of what their card says (or if they’ve lost it). Moore said many places are planning to ask patients to voluntarily provide a cell phone number, so they can get a text message telling them when and where their next dose is scheduled to be administered. Every dose administered will be reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. –CNN The DoD also released information on vaccine kits, which include a card, needle, syringe, alcohol wipes and a mask. There are approximately 100 million such kits ready to go as soon as ‘the’ vaccine(s) is(are) chosen, according to Operation Warp Speed CEO, Gen. Gustave Perna. The announcement comes less than two weeks after the UK government proposed “freedom passes” in order to reboot their economy – which would seemingly allow those willing to vaccinate a return to normal life. It also comes after signs of industries adapting to a future of immunity cards and vaccinations – with Ticketmaster and Quantas airlines both announcing they will require proof of vaccination before people can attend concerts or fly. Meanwhile, the vaccination roadshow has begun. On Wednesday, former presidents Obama, Clinton and Bush publicly announced that they would take the vaccine, on camera. “I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science,” Obama said in a Wednesday interview with Sirius XM radio – while Bush and Clinton made similar vows. The next day, NIH Director Dr. Anthony Fauci ominously warned that it would create a “very serious situation” if people don’t take the vaccine. From the party of “you don’t need an ID to vote” comes “show me your papers” to go anywhere and do anything. — Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) December 3, 2020 The frontrunning vaccine candidates come from two companies – Pfizer and Moderna – which are both awaiting emergency use authorizations in the United States. And FDA panel is expected to discuss the issue on December 10 and 17."
President Trump Delivers Hope In “Most Important Speech Ever”,3 DEC 2020,35492,"The following is the transcript of the president’s remarks. President Donald Trump: Thank you. This may be the most important speech I’ve ever made. I want to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to expose the tremendous voter fraud and irregularities which took place during the ridiculously long November 3rd elections. We used to have what was called, election day. Now we have election days, weeks, and months, and lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous period of time, especially when you have to prove almost nothing to exercise our greatest privilege, the right to vote. As President, I have no higher duty than to defend the laws and the Constitution of the United States. That is why I am determined to protect our election system, which is now under coordinated assault and siege. For months, leading up to the Presidential election, we were warned that we should not declare a premature victory. We were told repeatedly that it would take weeks if not, months, to determine the winner, to count the absentee ballots and to verify the results. My opponent was told to stay away from the election, don’t campaign. “We don’t need you. We’ve got it. This election is done.” In fact, they were acting like they already knew what the outcome was going to be. They had it covered and perhaps they did, very sadly for our country. It was all very, very strange. Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner even while many key states were still being counted. The constitutional process must be allowed to continue. We’re going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted. This is not just about honoring the votes of 74 million Americans who voted for me, it’s about ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections. Today I will detail some of the shocking irregularities, abuses and fraud that had been revealed in recent weeks but before laying out just a small portion of the evidence we have uncovered, and we have so much evidence, I want to explain the corrupt mail-in balloting scheme that Democrats systematically put into place that allowed voting to be altered, especially in swing states, which they had to win. They just didn’t know that it was going to be that tough, because we were leading in every swing state by so much, far greater than they ever thought possible. While it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter fraud from Detroit to Philadelphia, to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places. What changed this year was the Democrat party’s relentless push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind. This allowed fraud and abuse to occur in a scale never seen before. Using the pandemic as a pretext, Democrat politicians and judges drastically changed election procedures just months, and in some cases, weeks before the election on the 3rd of November. Very rarely were legislatures involved and constitutionally, they had to be involved, but very, very rarely, and you’ll see that as we continue to file our suits, it’s constitutionally, absolutely incorrect what took place, even from a legal standpoint. Many states, such as Nevada and California sent millions of live ballots to every person on their voter rolls whether those individuals had requested ballots or not, whether they were dead or alive, they got ballots. Other states such as Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, instituted universal absentee balloting right in the middle of an election year, sending absentee ballot requests forms to all voters on all rolls. It didn’t matter who they were. This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the flood gates to massive fraud. It’s a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state, and even our non-citizens of our country. Beyond this, the records are riddled with errors, wrong addresses, duplicate entries, and many other issues. This is not disputed. It has never been disputed. Dozens of counties in the key swing states have more registered voters on the rolls than they have voting age citizens, including 67 counties in Michigan. All of this is evidence. In Wisconsin, the state’s Board of Elections could not confirm the residency of more than 100,000 people, but repeatedly refused to remove those names from its voter rolls before the election. They knew why, nobody else did. I knew why. They were illegal voters. It is a travesty that in the year 2020, we do not have any means of verifying the eligibility of those who cast ballots in an election and such an important election it is, or determining who they are, whether they live in the state or whether they’re even American citizens. We have no idea. We have an in all swing states major infractions or outright fraud, which is far more in numbers or votes then we need to overturn the results of a state. In other words, in Wisconsin, as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes. I can show you right here, that Wisconsin, we’re leading by a lot and then at 3:42 in the morning, there was this, it was a massive dump of votes, mostly Biden, almost all Biden. To this day, everyone’s trying to figure out, “Where did it come from?” But I went from leading by a lot, to losing by a little and that’s right here. That’s at 3:42 in the morning, that’s Wisconsin, a terrible thing, terrible, terrible thing. But we will have far more, many times more than the 20,000 votes needed to overturn the state. If we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can’t be president. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of votes. We’re talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before. Just as an example, in certain states, we’ll be down by, let’s say, 7,000 votes, but we’ll find later on 20,000, 50,000, 100,00, 200,000 discrepancies or fraudulent votes, and that includes votes that went through when they were not allowed to be seen by Republican poll watchers, because the poll watchers were locked out of the building. Or people that innocently came to vote on November 3rd, who were all excited about their vote, they were happy. They were proud to be citizens of the United States of America, and they went up and they said, “I’d like to vote.” They were told that they can’t vote. “I’m sorry,” they were told, “I’m sorry. You’ve already voted by mail-in ballot. Congratulations. We received a ballot, so you can no longer vote.” They didn’t know what to do. They had no one to complain to, most just left and said, “That’s strange.” But many people complained and complained vehemently, and in a lot of cases, they filled out a provisional ballot, which was almost never used, but in virtually every case was a vote for Trump. In other words, they went in to vote and they were told that they voted and they didn’t vote. They left and they felt horror and they lost respect for our system. This happened tens of thousands of times all over the country. That’s how desperate the Democrats were. They would fill out ballots of people not even knowing if these people were going to show up. When they did show up, they said, “Sorry, you’ve already voted.” On top of everything else, we have a company that’s very suspect. Its name is Dominion, with the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you could press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden. What kind of a system is this? We have to go to paper, maybe it takes longer. But the only secure system is paper. Not these systems that nobody understands, including in many cases, the people that run them. Although, unfortunately, I think they understand them far too well. In one Michigan County, as an example, that used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6,000 votes had been wrongly switched from Trump to Biden, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is what we caught. How many didn’t we catch? Are there 100s of other examples throughout the country? Are there 1000s? We just got lucky and they called it a glitch, but we found numerous glitches that evening. 96% of the company’s political donations went to Democrats, not surprisingly. Frankly, when you look at who’s running the company, who’s in charge, who owns it, which we don’t know, where are the votes counted? Which we think are counted in foreign countries, not in the United States, Dominion is a disaster. Election authorities in Texas have repeatedly blocked the deployment of Dominion systems due to concerns about security vulnerabilities and the potential for errors and outright fraud. Every district that uses Dominion systems must be carefully monitored and carefully investigated- [inaudible 00:12:00] monitored and carefully investigated, but not only for the future. Right now, we’re worried about the present, and what went on with an election that we won without question. Under my lead, the Republicans won almost every state house in the United States, which they weren’t expected to do. We went up to 16 seats in the house. The numbers are still being tabulated, because there are nine seats that nobody really knows. They don’t know. Two weeks later, it’s still under consideration, because it’s a mess. Republicans were supposed to lose many seats, and instead they won those seats in the house, and a very important election that’s coming up will determine whether, or not we hold the Senate. David Perdue and Kelly Leffler are two tremendous people. Unfortunately, in Georgia, they’re using the same horrible dominion system, and it’s already been out that, think of it, hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots have been requested. You check it out who’s requesting those ballots. The difference is, it’s one state, and we will have our eyes on it like nobody’s ever watched anything before, because we have to win those two Senate seats. The tremendous success we had in the House of Representatives, and the tremendous success we’ve had so far in the Senate, unexpected success all over the country, and right here in Washington. It is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge lost. The greatest pollsters, the real pollsters, not the ones that had us down 17 points in Wisconsin when we actually won, or the ones that had us down four or five points in Florida, and we won by many points, or had us even, and down in Texas, and we won by a lot, not those pollsters, but real pollsters. Pollsters that are fair, and honest said, “We can’t understand a thing like this. It’s never happened before. You led the country to victory, and you were the only one that was lost. It’s not possible.” The speaker of the house of a certain state said, “Sir, I expected to lose my seat, and instead, because of you, and because of that incredible charge, and all of those rallies, we had a tremendous victory, and everybody knows it. You are much more popular than me, sir, except I got many more votes than you did, and it’s impossible that that happened. There is something wrong.” I’ll tell you what’s wrong, voter fraud. Here’s an example. This is Michigan. At 6:31 in the morning, a vote dump of 149,772 votes came in unexpectedly. We were winning by a lot. That batch was received in horror. Nobody knows anything about it. By the way, there’s your line. This is one of many. Here’s what is normal, and all of a sudden, look at that. This is normal, normal. Look even here, normal, and then boom, all of a sudden, I go from winning by a lot to losing a tight race. It’s corrupt. Detroit is corrupt. I have a lot of friends in Detroit. They know it, but Detroit is totally corrupt. Look at this, look at this. That’s at 6:31 in the morning, unexpectedly came in. In the recent recount in Georgia, which means nothing because they don’t want to check signatures, and if you’re not going to check signatures in Georgia, it doesn’t work, but we have a secretary of state, and a governor who made it very difficult to check signatures. Why? You’ll have to ask them, but without a signature match, or a check, it doesn’t matter. They found thousands and thousands of votes that were out of whack, all against me. This was during a recount that I didn’t even think mattered. They found many thousands of votes, and that recount didn’t matter. The one that matters is the one that’s going on now, that because of the fact it’s so close, they had to by law give another recount, but the recount has to be a recount where they check the signatures. Otherwise, they’re just checking the same dishonest thing. It won’t matter. In this case, the signatures on envelopes are the only thing that is relevant. We will compare the signature on the envelope to the signatures from past elections, and we will find that many thousands of people signed these ballots illegally. The Democrats had this election rigged right from the beginning. They used the pandemic, sometimes referred to as the China virus, where it originated as an excuse to mail out tens of millions of ballots, which ultimately led to a big part of the fraud, a fraud that the whole world is watching, and there is no one happier right now than China. Many people received two, three and four ballots. They were sent to dead people by the thousands. In fact, dead people, and we have many examples filled out ballots, made applications, and then, voted, which is even worse. In other words, dead people went through a process. Some have been dead for 25 years. Millions of votes were cast illegally in the swing states alone, and if that’s the case, the results of the individual swing states must be overturned, and overturned immediately. Some people say that’s too far out, that’s too harsh. Well, does that mean we take a precedent, and we’ve just elected a president where the votes were fraudulent? President Donald Trump: (19:01)
No, it means you have to turn over the election, and everybody knows without going much further, and they’ve seen the evidence, but they don’t want to talk about it what a disaster this election was, a total catastrophe, but we’re going to show it, and hopefully, the courts in particular, the Supreme Court of the United States will see it, and respectfully, hopefully, they will do what’s right for our country, because our country can not live with this kind of an election. We could say, let’s go on to the next one, but no, we have to look also at our past. We can’t let this happen. Maybe you’ll have a revote, but I don’t think that’s appropriate. When those votes are corrupt, when they’re irregular, when they get caught, they’re terminated, and I very easily win. In all states, I very easily win, the swing states, just like I won them at 10 o’clock in the evening, the evening of the election. We’re not looking to show you 25 faulty or fraudulent votes, which don’t mean anything, because it doesn’t overturn the state, or a fifty, or a hundred. We’re showing you hundreds of thousands far more than we need, far more than the margin, far more than the law requires. We can show many times what is necessary to win the state. The media knows this, but they don’t want to report it. In fact, they outright refuse to even cover it, because they know the result if they do. Even what I’m saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that’s okay. I just keep on going forward, because I’m representing 74 million people, and in fact, I’m also representing all of the people that didn’t vote for me. The mail-in voting scam is the latest part of their four year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election, and it’s been like living in hell. Our opponents have proven many times again and again, that they will say, and do anything to get back into power. The corrupt forces who are registering dead voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same people who have perpetrated one phony and fraudulent hoax after another. You’ve been watching it now for four years. These entrenched interests oppose our movement, because we put America first. They don’t put America first, and we’re returning power to you the American people. They don’t want America first, they only want power for themselves. They want to make money, that’s why they don’t want me as your president. I’ve been investigated from soon after I announced I was running for president. When I immediately went to number one in the Republican primary polls, the investigations never stopped. They went on for four years, and I won them all, I beat them all. Russia, Russia, Russia, the impeachment hoax, and so much more. Robert Mueller spent $48 million of taxpayer money investigating me for two and a half years, issued over 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, issued 230 orders for communications records, and conducted 500 witness interviews, all looking to take me down. There was no collusion in the end, none whatsoever. Senator Marco Rubio, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee stated, “The committee found no evidence that then candidate Donald Trump, or his campaign colluded with the Russian government.” And, I thank Senator Rubio for that statement. Now, I hear that these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece of information to New York, so that they can try to get me there. It’s all been gone over, over and over again. For $48 million you go through tax returns, you go through everything. The New York attorney general, who recently ran for office campaigned without knowing me stating, “We will join with law enforcement and other attorneys general across this nation in removing this president from office.” I never met her. It’s important that everybody understand she’s… … better. “It’s important that everybody understands”, she said, “that the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end.” And all it’s been is a big investigation in Washington and New York and any place else that can investigate because that’s what they want to do. They want to take not me, but us down. Then we can never let them do that. Everything has been looked at. A friend of mine, who’s very smart, said, “You’ve probably seen more than anybody else. You’ve probably been investigated more than anybody else. And for you to come out with a clean bill of health makes you probably the cleanest person in this country.” Some people in this administration, but fortunately not all have been beaten down and disparaged. They just disappeared. Nobody knows what happened to them. Why aren’t they active? Why aren’t they involved? There’s so much to be involved in. The corruption is so rampant. They just couldn’t take it anymore. They were threatened by Democrats with impeachment and horrible things were said about them. And they’re good people. Even recently, the head of the GSA was hounded and harassed as she reported, like she has never been before. What can I say? We caught Comey cold, we caught McCabe cold. We caught them all. We’re still waiting for a report from a man named Durham, who I have never spoken to, and I have never met. They can go after me before the election as much as they want, but unfortunately Mr. Durham didn’t want to go after these people, or have anything to do with going after them before the election. So who knows if he is ever going to even do a report. But if you look at the lies, and the leaks, and the illegal acts of behavior done by so many people, and their desire to hurt the president of the United States, something should happen. The hardest thing I have to do is explain why nothing is happening with all of these people that got caught spying on my campaign. It’s never happened before and it should never happen again to a president of the United States. All you have to do is watch the hearings and see for yourself. The evidence is overwhelming. The fraud that we’ve collected in recent weeks is overwhelming, having to do with our election. Everyone is saying, ” Wow, the evidence is overwhelming”, when they get to see it. But really it’s too late to change the course of an election. It’s too late to change the outcome. In fact, there is still plenty of time to certify the correct winner of the election and that’s what we’re fighting to do. But no matter when it happens, when they see fraud, when they see false votes and when those votes number far more than is necessary, you can’t let another person steal that election from you. All over the country, people are together in holding up signs, “Stop the steal.” To understand how we will challenge this fraud, it is important to know the problems with mail-in balloting. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and most other states allowed anyone to get an absentee ballot and cast their vote without showing any ID. The voting took place entirely on the honor system, no identification of any kind was required. Most Americans would also be shocked to learn that no state in the country verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal elections. This is a national disgrace. No other advanced country conducts elections this way. Many European countries have instituted major restrictions on mail-in voting, specifically, because they recognize the nearly unlimited potential for fraud. Out of 42 European nations, all but two prohibit absentee ballots entirely for people who reside inside the country, or else they require those who need absentee ballots to show a very, very powerful ID. Throughout the Democrat effort to dramatically expand mail-in voting, the Democrat party leaders were also, feverishly working to block measures, designed to protect against fraud, such as signature verification, residency verification, or voter ID. And citizenship confirmation was almost unthought of that we should ask for it. Can you believe this? These are not the actions of people who want fair elections. These are the actions of people who want to steal elections, who are willing to create fraud. The only conceivable reason why you would block common sense measures to verify legal eligibility for voting, is you are trying to encourage, enable, solicit, or carry out fraud. It is important for Americans to understand that these destructive changes to our election laws were not a necessary response to the pandemic. The pandemic simply gave the Democrats an excuse to do what they have been trying to do for many, many years. In fact, the very first bill that house Democrats introduced when Nancy Pelosi became speaker, was it attempt to mandate universal mail-in voting and eliminate measures such as voter ID, which is so necessary. Dramatically eroding the integrity of our elections was the Democrats number one priority for a simple reason, they wanted to steal the 2020 presidential election. All of the Democrat efforts to expand mail-in balloting laid the groundwork for the systematic and pervasive fraud that occurred in this election. In Pennsylvania, large amounts of mail-in and absentee ballots were processed illegally. And in secret, in Philadelphia, in Allegheny counties, without our observers present. They were not allowed to be present. In fact, they weren’t even allowed in the same room. They were thrown out of the building and they looked from outside in, but they had no way of even seeing, because there were no windows. And the windows that were there were boarded up. Democrats even went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to block observers from receiving access. There is only one possible reason that the corrupt Democrat political machine would oppose transparency during the vote counting. It’s because they know they are hiding illegal activity. It’s very simple. This is an egregious, inexcusable. And irreversible harm that stains the entire election, yet this unprecedented practice of excluding our observers, our vote watchers, as some people call them, occurred in Democrat run cities and key states all across the nation. Here are just some of the additional facts that we’ve uncovered. Many voters all across Pennsylvania received two ballots in the mail, and many others received mail-in ballots for which they never applied. So many get ballots, they didn’t even know what they were for. And again, so many received more than one ballot. In some cases, more than two ballots. And they happened to be, for the most part, Democrats. In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, multiple voters received ballots that were already filled out. They didn’t know what happened. In Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a poll watcher, overheard unregistered voters being told to return later to try to vote under a different name. Tens of thousands of voters across Pennsylvania were treated differently based on whether they were Republicans, or Democrats. Voters who submitted floored ballots in some Democrat precincts were notified and asked to fix their ballots, while Republican precincts, and in particular Republican voters, were not so notified which plainly violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. “If you are a Democrat, we’re going to fix up your ballot. make sure it’s perfect. If you are Republican, don’t even talk about it.” In Michigan, a career employee of the city of Detroit, with the city workers, coaching voters to vote straight Democrat, while accompanying them to watch who they were voting for, violating the law and the sanctity of the secret ballot. You can’t do that. The same workers say she was instructed not to ask for any ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures. She was also told to illegally backdate ballots, many, many ballots, received after the deadline. This is something that is so unconstitutional and she estimates that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated by her and many others. Other witnesses in Detroit also saw our election officials counting batches of the same ballots many times, as well as illegally duplicating ballots. One observer testified to seeing boxes and boxes of ballots, all bearing the same signature. Another observer in Detroit gave sworn testimony that he saw countless and valid ballots that did not belong to properly registered voters and then witnessed election workers in Wayne County entering fake birth dates into the system, in order to illegally count them. Witnesses of science wore an affidavit, so in other words, you go to jail if you lie, testifying that after election officials announced the last absentee votes had been received, a batch of tens of thousands of ballots arrived, many without envelopes, all voting for Democrats. In Wisconsin, a record number of voters were categorized as indefinitely confined. A status reserved for severely disabled individuals, also for the elderly that allow them to vote without showing ID. Last year, approximately 70,000 people claimed this status statewide. This year, the number miraculously was nearly 250,000 voters, after election officials in Milwaukee and Dane County, a couple of the most corrupt political places in our country, urged citizens to improperly register under this status. And register they did in levels that don’t exist. In Wisconsin, there are approximately 70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law in Georgia, nine observers have testified to seeing countless irregular ballots without… Testified to seeing countless irregular ballots without the creases or typical markings indicating that the ballots did not arrive in envelopes as required. A poll watcher in Fulton County estimated that approximately 98% of the large number of unusually pristine ballots that she witnessed were for Biden. Highly unusual number. In addition, thousands of uncounted ballots were discovered in Floyd, Fayette, and Walton counties weeks after the election, and these ballots were mostly from Trump voters. They weren’t counted. They were from Trump voters. In Detroit, everybody saw the tremendous conflict and the horrible way that the two Republican canvassers were treated so horribly because they wouldn’t vote when they saw that 71% of the precincts didn’t balance. Also, there were more votes than there were voters. Think of that. You had more votes than you had voters. That’s an easy one to figure, and it’s by the thousands. In Arizona, in-person voters whose balanced produced error messages from tabulation machines were told to press a button that resulted in their votes not being counted. Also in Arizona, the attorney general announced that mail-in ballots had been stolen from mailboxes and hidden under a rock. In Clark County, Nevada, where most of the state’s voters reside, the standards for matching a signature using the signature verification machine were intentionally lowered to allow large numbers of ballots to be counted that otherwise would never have passed muster. This machine was set at the lowest level. According to one report, in order to test the process, nine voters in Clark County cast ballots with intentionally incorrect signatures, and eight of the nine ballots were accepted and counted. They said you could sign your name as Santa Claus, and it would be accepted. Last week, the Clark County Commission threw out the results of a local election after the registrar reported finding, quote, “discrepancies that we can’t explain.” Also in Nevada, some voters were entered into a raffle for more than a dozen gift cards worth as much as $250 if they could prove they had voted. This took place on Indian reservations. One of the most significant indications of widespread fraud is the extraordinarily low rejection rates for mail-in ballots in many key states. These are the states that I had to win. In swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience. That means years and years of voting. In Georgia, just 0.2%, that’s substantially less than 1%, of mail-in ballots have been rejected. In other words, almost none have been rejected. They took everything. Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016. There are those that think that 6.4 was a low number. Think of it. Almost none were rejected. The previous election, 6.4% were rejected. We have seen similar declines in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan. Ballots weren’t rejected, especially if they happen to be in Democrat areas. These irregularities are inexplicable unless there is a deliberate effort to accept ineligible ballots or fraudulent ballots. In Pennsylvania, the secretary of state and the state supreme court in essence abolished signature verification requirements just weeks prior to the election, in violation of state law. You’re not allowed to do that. It has to be approved by the legislature. A judge can’t do it. A state can’t do it. An official can’t do it. The only one that can do it is the legislature. The reason for this is clear. They were not verifying signatures because they know the ballots have not been filled out by the voters in whose names they were cast. In other words, people filled them out that had nothing to do with the names on the ballot. A simple recount of the ballots under these circumstances only compounds the fraud. The only way to determine whether there was an honest vote is to conduct a full review of the envelopes in the relevant states. You will find that many of them, tens of thousands, have fraudulent signatures. A full forensic audit is required to ensure that only legal ballots from lawfully registered voters that were properly cast are included in the final count. This election is about great voter fraud, fraud that has never been seen like this before. It’s about poll watchers who were not allowed to watch. So illegal. It’s about ballots that poured in, and nobody but a few knew where they came from. They were counted, and they weren’t for me. It’s about big leads on election night, tremendous leads, leads where I was being congratulated for a decisive easy victory. All of a sudden, by morning or a couple of days later, those leads rapidly evaporated. It’s about numbers of ballots that were sent that nobody know where they came from. It’s about machinery that was defective, machinery that was stopped during certain parts of the evening, miraculously to open with more votes. It was about many other things, but above all, it was about fraud. This election was rigged. Everybody knows it. I don’t mind if I lose an election, but I want to lose an election fair and square. What I don’t want to do is have it stolen from the American people. That’s what we’re fighting for. We have no choice to be doing that. We already have the proof. We already have the evidence, and it’s very clear. Many people in the media and even judges so far have refused to accept it. They know it’s true. They know it’s there. They know who won the election, but they refuse to say, “You’re right.” Our country needs somebody to say, “You’re right.” Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result, and I hope that Joe Biden is as well. We already have the proof. We already have tens of thousands of ballots more than we need to overturn all of these states that we’re talking about. This is an election for the highest office in the greatest country in the history of the world. Every reasonable American should be able to agree, based on what we have already documented, that we need a systematic analysis of the mail-in ballots to review the envelopes. It’s about the signature. If they’re on the envelopes, we can only review the envelopes, and that will tell us everything. This is the absolute minimum we should expect. This is not just about my campaign, although it has a lot to do with who’s going to be your next president. This is about restoring faith and confidence in American elections. This is about our democracy and the sacred rights that generations of Americans have fought, bled, and died to secure. Nothing is more urgent or more important. The only ballots that should count in this election are those cast by eligible voters who are citizens of our country, residents of the states in which they voted, and who cast their ballots in a lawful manner before the legal deadline. Moreover, we must never again have an election in which there is not a reliable and transparent system to verify the eligibility, identity, and residency of every single person who casts a ballot, a very, very cherished ballot. Many very smart people have congratulated me on all we’ve done: the biggest tax cuts in history, regulation cuts, the biggest in history. We rebuilt our military. We took care of our vets like never before, Space Force, and so much more. Then they went on to say, as big and as important as these events were, the single greatest achievement in your presidency will be exactly what you’re doing right now: voter integrity for our nation. It’s more important than any of the things that we discussed. If we don’t root out the fraud, the tremendous and horrible fraud that’s taken place in our 2020 election, we don’t have a country anymore. With the resolve and support of the American people, we will restore honesty and integrity to our elections. We will restore trust in our system of government. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.  "
COVID Court Case Proves Probability Of Receiving “False Positive Is 97% Or Higher”,30 NOV 2020,5917,"In a groundbreaking case that proves the COVID lie was designed to actually destroy economies and establish state control, a court has found that the likelihood of receiving a “false positive is 97% or higher” when taking a coronavirus test. RT reported: Four German holidaymakers who were illegally quarantined in Portugal after one was judged to be positive for Covid-19 have won their case, in a verdict that condemns the widely-used PCR test as being up to 97-percent unreliable. Earlier this month, Portuguese judges upheld a decision from a lower court that found the forced quarantine of four holidaymakers to be unlawful. The case centered on the reliability (or lack thereof) of Covid-19 PCR tests. The verdict, delivered on November 11, followed an appeal against a writ of habeas corpus filed by four Germans against the Azores Regional Health Authority. This body had been appealing a ruling from a lower court which had found in favor of the tourists, who claimed that they were illegally confined to a hotel without their consent. The tourists were ordered to stay in the hotel over the summer after one of them tested positive for coronavirus in a PCR test – the other three were labelled close contacts and therefore made to quarantine as well. Unreliable, with a strong chance of false positives The deliberation of the Lisbon Appeal Court is comprehensive and fascinating. It ruled that the Azores Regional Health Authority had violated both Portuguese and international law by confining the Germans to the hotel. The judges also said that only a doctor can “diagnose” someone with a disease, and were critical of the fact that they were apparently never assessed by one. They were also scathing about the reliability of the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, the most commonly used check for Covid. The conclusion of their 34-page ruling included the following: “In view of current scientific evidence, this test shows itself to be unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt that such positivity corresponds, in fact, to the infection of a person by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”   In the eyes of this court, then, a positive test does not correspond to a Covid case. The two most important reasons for this, said the judges, are that, “the test’s reliability depends on the number of cycles used’’ and that “the test’s reliability depends on the viral load present.’’ In other words, there are simply too many unknowns surrounding PCR testing. Tested positive? There could be as little as a 3% chance it’s correct  This is not the first challenge to the credibility of PCR tests. Many people will be aware that their results have a lot to do with the number of amplifications that are performed, or the ‘cycle threshold.’ This number in most American and European labs is 35–40 cycles, but experts have claimed that even 35 cycles is far too many, and that a more reasonable protocol would call for 25–30 cycles. (Each cycle exponentially increases the amount of viral DNA in the sample). Earlier this year, data from three US states – New York, Nevada and Massachusetts – showed that when the amount of the virus found in a person was taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who tested positive could actually have been negative, as they may have been carrying only tiny amounts of the virus. The Portuguese judges cited a study conducted by “some of the leading European and world specialists,” which was published by Oxford Academic at the end of September. It showed that if someone tested positive for Covid at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher, the chances of that person actually being infected is less than three percent, and that “the probability of… receiving a false positive is 97% or higher.” While the judges in this case admitted that the cycle threshold used in Portuguese labs was unknown, they took this as further proof that the detention of the tourists was unlawful. The implication was that the results could not be trusted. Because of this uncertainty, they stated that there was “no way this court would ever be able to determine” whether the tourist who tested positive was indeed a carrier of the virus, or whether the others had been exposed to it. Read more Sshhh – don’t tell anyone It is a sad indictment of our mainstream media that such a landmark ruling, of such obvious and pressing international importance, has been roundly ignored. If one were making (flimsy) excuses for them, one could say that the case escaped the notice of most science editors because it has been published in Portuguese. But there is a full English translation of the appeal, and alternative media managed to pick it up. And it isn’t as if Portugal is some remote, mysterious nation where news is unreliable or whose judges are suspect – this is a western EU country with a large population and a similar legal system to many other parts of Europe. And it is not the only country whose institutions are clashing with received wisdom on Covid. Finland’s national health authority has disputed the WHO’s recommendation to test as many people as possible for coronavirus, saying it would be a waste of taxpayer’s money, while poorer South East Asian countries are holding off on ordering vaccines, citing an improper use of finite resources. Testing, especially PCR testing, is the basis for the entire house of cards of Covid restrictions that are wreaking havoc worldwide. From testing comes case numbers. From case numbers come the ‘R number,’ the rate at which a carrier infects others. From the ‘dreaded’ R number comes the lockdowns and the restrictions, such as England’s new and baffling tiered restrictions that come into force next week. The daily barrage of statistics is familiar to us all by this point, but as time goes on the evidence that something may be deeply amiss with the whole foundation of our reaction to this pandemic – the testing regime – continues to mount."
Vote Tabulation Data Suggests Nearly 100K Votes “Missing” From Trump Totals,30 NOV 2020,4688,"In the battleground states, Dominion made sure that Donald Trump wouldn’t win. But, President Trump received a historic wave of real votes, forcing them to stop the counting to infuse fake ones. Just The News reported on “anomalies” that show missing votes: Vote tabulation data in various battleground states contain “anomalies” with massive swings toward Joe Biden that suggest missing ballots for President Trump, according to data expert Justin Hart, who helped raise millions of dollars for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Trump has retweeted charts from Hart questioning vote tabulations, including retweeting Hart’s calculation showing that Trump would have had to lose votes in Pennsylvania if the real-time, individual, timed stamped entries from The New York Times were accurate. Hart said his analysis was used in a Pennsylvania legislative hearing Wednesday with numerous witnesses alleging voter fraud and voter irregularities. “You know what’s even MORE suspicious than BIG vote dumps giving Biden the lead in WI and MI? Taking AWAY votes from @realDonaldTrump in Pennsylvania!,” Hart tweeted Nov. 20 in a tweet that Trump retweeted on Tuesday. “This chart: the 25 data dumps where Trump LOST votes from the Dominion feeds. 97,676 votes LOST! And Biden GAINED 160K+ votes!” “There’s a lot of anomalies in that data,” Hart said in an interview with Just the News. “And then I think the real evidence though is in the pure volume, when you have a big batch that comes in at like 96%, for Biden, it’s unclear where they would find enough precincts that would have that many votes.” While the Times released percentage changes and did not release raw vote numbers, Hart said his analysis of Pennsylvania was based on the percentage change that would have had to have occurred to have that level of swing toward Biden and away from Trump, which would yield votes lost for the president if the tally was accurate. Pennsylvania has been ground zero for questions about voter fraud, with a state judge in Pennsylvania on Friday announced she was upholding her earlier injunction against the state’s certification of 2020 election results, stating that plaintiffs have “viable claim” that state mail-in ballot rule was illegal. The state Suprem Court later overturned her ruling. In Georgia, Hart said he spotted a similar trend, with Trump appearing to lose votes rather than simply seeing his lead shrink or Biden surpass his share of the electorate. “I have no idea if fraud was involved,” Hart tweeted. “There is no audit of what happens between all of the dashboards we watch and when the voters votes. It’s an opaque black box. But between misplaced votes, thumb drives and algorithms smelling to high heaven – I want more sunlight please.” Hart said the high prevalence of Dominion Voting Systems is a red flag for him in terms of how many steps that must take place to reduce user error when tabulating votes. Dominion has repeatedly stated there were no problems with its machines during the Nov. 3 election. “When you go look at, for example, the training videos on Dominion, you realize how quickly all this can go south,” Hart told Just the News. “There’s so much room for user error. And I’ve worked in enterprise workflows before—both in healthcare and startups and in government, when I was working for different political entities–and one of the things you quickly realize is when you have a workflow or a flow that someone needs to follow, is remove as much user input as needed. Because otherwise there’s just going to be mistakes, and there’s so much room for awfulness there that it just blows the mind. And every IT person is just cringing when they look at these videos.” Hart said the Dominion training videos, for example, shows that when votes are tallied and they’re ready to be added together, “you go to the shared drive and you select the files that you want to use, and then you upload them, be sure to check this file—so much room for user error, let alone the fraud applications, it’s just a lot of room for error.” In his analysis of Wisconsin, two days after the election, Hart noticed another questionable trend, tweeting out that “49K people voted for a Republican House candidate down ballot but DID NOT vote for Trump. Meanwhile, 64K people voted for Biden and did NOT vote for a Democrat house candidate. Also, 14,952 people DID NOT vote for a house candidate and just voted for Prez. Ok.” … “I make clear that the real issue is the opaqueness of the entire endeavor,” Hart said in a Wednesday tweet. “I would love to be proven wrong about the fraud… but the entire pipeline in between votes and dashboard is dark and smelly frankly.”"
Federal Judge Rules In Kentucky Governor’s Shut Down Of Private And Public Schools,26 NOV 2020,7534,"In Kentucky, the democrat governor just got schooled by a federal judge. His totalitarian order to shut down all public and private schools was just stopped… at least by half. The Courier Journal reported: A federal judge has struck down a portion of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s executive order requiring private as well as public schools to halt in-person classes until early January amid the latest wave of COVID-19 cases. U.S. District Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove ruled Wednesday the governor’s order cannot apply to private, religious-based schools across the state because it infringes on their constitutional rights. The order can, however, remain in place for public schools. “If social distancing is good enough for offices, colleges, and universities within the Commonwealth, it is good enough for religious private K-12 schools that benefit from constitutional protection,” Van Tatenhove wrote in the ruling. “Ultimately, ‘[t]he First Amendment protects the right of religious institutions ‘to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.’” As such, Beshear is “enjoined from enforcing the prohibition on in-person instruction with respect to any religious private school in Kentucky that adheres to applicable social distancing and hygiene guidelines,” according to the ruling. Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said his office has already appealed to the Sixth Circuit, will request an emergency stay of the judge’s order and, if necessary, appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “Let’s be clear: lives are on the line, and everyone must do their part to defeat the virus,” Staley said. Elementary schools not in “red” counties, which average 25 or more new daily coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents, can resume in-person classes Dec. 7 as long as they follow the state’s “Healthy At School” guidance, according to Beshear’s order. Danville Christian Academy, a Boyle County school that serves 234 students in preschool through 12th grade, and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron filed their lawsuit against Beshear last week to seek a statewide temporary restraining order for the ban on in-person classes. The suit, which was filed Nov. 20 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, argued Beshear’s executive order violates the First Amendment as well as the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Cameron and attorneys for Danville Christian Academy also questioned why private schools following public health guidelines to safely hold in-person classes during the pandemic must close if places like malls, child care centers, offices and movie theaters can remain open. Attorneys from the Texas-based First Liberty Institute who represented the Danville school argued in-person classes should not have to stop when many religious-based schools are connected to churches that can keep holding in-person worship services. In addition, they said the Boyle County Health Department noted Danville Christian Academy is “doing it right” by enacting safety precautions for in-person classes. “The court recognized that Gov. Beshear’s order prohibiting religious schools from holding in-person classes goes beyond his authority and violates the First Amendment,” Roger Byron, senior counsel at First Liberty, said after the ruling.  “We are grateful the court restored the rule of law. The CDC has made it clear that students are safest when they are at school, and Danville Christian Academy has implemented extensive safety protocols approved by local health officials.” Van Tatenhove ruled this summer Beshear could not stop churches from holding in-person worship services during the pandemic. “We are disappointed but not surprised that Judge Van Tatenhove, for the second time, has refused to acknowledge the U.S. Supreme Court decision that found an action like this is both legal and constitutional,” Staley said Wednesday night. The new ruling from Van Tatenhove comes about two weeks after the Kentucky Supreme Court had unanimously upheld Beshear’s authority to issue executive orders in a public health emergency. In a statement tweeted out Wednesday night, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron approved of the court’s decision, adding that “this is not the first time during this pandemic where religious exercise has been threatened.” On Nov. 18, Beshear issued the school-related order and unveiled new restrictions that apply until mid-December for restaurants, bars, gyms, offices, indoor gatherings, weddings and funerals. The governor has said the new orders are necessary to try to stem the third wave of coronavirus cases in Kentucky, which has reported over 160,000 cases of the virus and 1,800 deaths since March. … The governor and his legal team argued the ban on in-person classes is not violating the religious freedoms of private schools because it also applies to public schools. But Van Tatenhove wrote Beshear’s argument is not consistent with a previous Sixth Circuit opinion this year in a case involving whether Maryville Baptist Church could hold in-person worship in Bullitt County. “This Court wonders why under this executive order, one would be free to attend a lecture, go to work, or attend a concert, but not attend socially distanced chapel in school or pray together in a classroom that is following strict safety procedures and social distancing,” Van Tatenhove wrote in Wednesday’s ruling. Several Republican leaders in the General Assembly responded to the new orders by vowing to rein in Beshear and limit his powers with new legislation in early 2021. Nine additional Christian schools, more than 1,000 parents and Kentucky State Treasurer Allison Ball also filed briefs to support Danville Christian Academy in its suit. A group of private Christian schools, churches and parents followed the lead of Danville Christian Academy by also suing Beshear for his in-person classes ban as well as the order limiting indoor social gatherings to eight or fewer people from two separate households. … Debates over continuing with in-person classes have taken place around the country and world in recent months. In Kentucky, all but a few of the state’s 120 counties have been in the “red” zone for their higher case rates per 100,000 residents, with local schools switching to remote learning in response to safety concerns. “There is ample scientific evidence that Covid-19 is exceptionally contagious,” Van Tatenhove wrote in his ruling. “But evidence that the risk of contagion is heightened in a religious setting any more than a secular setting, or in K-12 schools as opposed to preschools, universities, or colleges, is lacking.” … Supporters of Danville Christian Academy and other schools that seek to continue in-person classes point to comments last week from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Robert Redfield said during a Nov. 19 White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing that K-12 schools “can operate with face-to-face learning, and they can do it safely and they can do it responsibly.” “The truth is, for kids K through 12, one of the safest places they can be, from our perspective, is to remain in school,” Redfield said. “And it’s really important that — following the data, making sure we don’t make emotional decisions about what to close and what not to close.” Van Tatenhove cited Redfield’s comments in his Wednesday ruling, writing Beshear’s executive order “also seems to run counter to CDC recommendations.”"
“Pandemic Is Over”: Scientist Silenced By YouTube Exposes Second Wave Almost All “False Positives”,23 NOV 2020,14766,"The supposed pandemic is over, people. That’s according to the former chief scientist of Pfizer. Zero Hedge compiled the evidence that almost all these new cases are “false positives”: This video provides one of the most erudite and informative looks at Covid-19 and the consequences of lockdowns. As AIER notes, it was remarkable this week to watch as it appeared on YouTube and was forcibly taken down only 2 hours after posting. The copy below is hosted on LBRY, a blockchain video application. In a year of fantastic educational content, this is one of the best we’ve seen. Consider the presenter’s bio: Dr. Michael Yeadon is an Allergy & Respiratory Therapeutic Area expert with 23 years in the pharmaceutical industry. He trained as a biochemist and pharmacologist, obtaining his PhD from the University of Surrey (UK) in 1988. Dr. Yeadon then worked at the Wellcome Research Labs with Salvador Moncada with a research focus on airway hyper-responsiveness and effects of pollutants including ozone and working in drug discovery of 5-LO, COX, PAF, NO and lung inflammation. With colleagues, he was the first to detect exhaled NO in animals and later to induce NOS in lung via allergic triggers. Joining Pfizer in 1995, he was responsible for the growth and portfolio delivery of the Allergy & Respiratory pipeline within the company. He was responsible for target selection and the progress into humans of new molecules, leading teams of up to 200 staff across all disciplines and won an Achievement Award for productivity in 2008. Under his leadership the research unit invented oral and inhaled NCEs which delivered multiple positive clinical proofs of concept in asthma, allergic rhinitis and COPD. He led productive collaborations such as with Rigel Pharmaceuticals (SYK inhibitors) and was involved in the licensing of Spiriva and acquisition of the Meridica (inhaler device) company. Dr. Yeadon has published over 40 original research articles and now consults and partners with a number of biotechnology companies. Before working with Apellis, Dr. Yeadon was VP and Chief Scientific Officer (Allergy & Respiratory Research) with Pfizer. What likely triggered the Silicon Valley censor-mongers is the fact that a former Chief Science Officer for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer says “there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.” The “Big Pharma” insider asserts that false positive results from inherently unreliable COVID tests are being used to manufacture a “second wave” based on “new cases.” As Ralph Lopez write at HubPages, Yeadon warns that half or even “almost all” of tests for COVID are false positives. Dr. Yeadon also argues that the threshold for herd immunity may be much lower than previously thought, and may have been reached in many countries already. In an interview last week (see below) Dr. Yeadon was asked: “we are basing a government policy, an economic policy, a civil liberties policy, in terms of limiting people to six people in a meeting…all based on, what may well be, completely fake data on this coronavirus?” Dr. Yeadon answered with a simple “yes.” Even more significantly, even if all positives were to be correct, Dr. Yeadon said that given the “shape” of all important indicators in a worldwide pandemic, such as hospitalizations, ICU utilization, and deaths, “the pandemic is fundamentally over.” Yeadon said in the interview: “Were it not for the test data that you get from the TV all the time, you would rightly conclude that the pandemic was over, as nothing much has happened. Of course people go to the hospital, moving into the autumn flu season…but there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.” In a paper published this month, which was co-authored by Yeadon and two of his colleagues, “How Likely is a Second Wave?”, the scientists write: “It has widely been observed that in all heavily infected countries in Europe and several of the US states likewise, that the shape of the daily deaths vs. time curves is similar to ours in the UK. Many of these curves are not just similar, but almost super imposable.” In the data for UK, Sweden, the US, and the world, it can be seen that in all cases, deaths were on the rise in March through mid or late April, then began tapering off in a smooth slope which flattened around the end of June and continues to today. The case rates however, based on testing, rise and swing upwards and downwards wildly. Media messaging in the US is already ramping up expectations of a “second wave.” The survival rate of COVID-19 has been upgraded since May to 99.8% of infections. This comes close to ordinary flu, the survival rate of which is 99.9%. Although COVID can have serious after-effects, so can flu or any respiratory illness. The present survival rate is far higher than initial grim guesses in March and April, cited by Dr. Anthony Fauci, of 94%, or 20 to 30 times deadlier. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) value accepted by Yeadon et al in the paper is .26%. The survival rate of a disease is 100% minus the IFR. Dr. Yeadon pointed out that the “novel” COVID-19 contagion is novel only in the sense that it is a new type of coronavirus. But, he said, there are presently four strains which circulate freely throughout the population, most often linked to the common cold. In the scientific paper, Yeadon et al write: “There are at least four well characterised family members (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) which are endemic and cause some of the common colds we experience, especially in winter. They all have striking sequence similarity to the new coronavirus.” The scientists argue that much of the population already has, if not antibodies to COVID, some level of “T-cell” immunity from exposure to other related coronaviruses, which have been circulating long before COVID-19. The scientists write: “A major component our immune systems is the group of white blood cells called T-cells whose job it is to memorise a short piece of whatever virus we were infected with so the right cell types can multiply rapidly and protect us if we get a related infection. Responses to COVID-19 have been shown in dozens of blood samples taken from donors before the new virus arrived.” Introducing the idea that some prior immunity to COVID-19 already existed, the authors of “How Likely is a Second Wave?” write: “It is now established that at least 30% of our population already had immunological recognition of this new virus, before it even arrived…COVID-19 is new, but coronaviruses are not.” They go on to say that, because of this prior resistance, only 15-25% of a population being infected may be sufficient to reach herd immunity: “…epidemiological studies show that, with the extent of prior immunity that we can now reasonably assume to be the case, only 15-25% of the population being infected is sufficient to bring the spread of the virus to a halt…” In the US, accepting a death toll of 200,000, and a survival rate of 99.8%, this would mean for every person who has died, there would be about 400 people who had been infected, and lived. This would translate to around 80 million Americans, or 27% of the population. This touches Yeadon’s and his colleagues’ threshold for herd immunity. Finally, the former Pfizer executive and scientist singles out one former colleague for withering rebuke for his role in the pandemic, Professor Neil Ferguson. Ferguson taught at Imperial College while Yeadon was affiliated. Ferguson’s computer model provided the rationale for governments to launch draconian orders which turned free societies into virtual prisons overnight. Over what is now estimated by the CDC to be a 99.8% survival rate virus. Dr. Yeadon said in the interview that “no serious scientist gives any validity” to Ferguson’s model. Speaking with thinly-veiled contempt for Ferguson, Dr. Yeadon took special pains to point out to his interviewer: “It’s important that you know most scientists don’t accept that it [Ferguson’s model] was even faintly right…but the government is still wedded to the model.” Yeadon joins other scientists in castigating governments for following Ferguson’s model, the assumptions of which all worldwide lockdowns are based on. One of these scientists is Dr. Johan Giesecke, former chief scientist for the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who called Ferguson’s model “the most influential scientific paper” in memory, and also “one of the most wrong.” It was Ferguson’s model which held that “mitigation” measures were necessary, i.e. social distancing and business closures, in order to prevent, for example, over 2.2 million people dying from COVID in the US. Ferguson predicted that Sweden would pay a terrible price for no lockdown, with 40,000 COVID deaths by May 1, and 100,000 by June. Sweden’s death count is under 6,000. The Swedish government says this coincides to a mild flu season. Although initially higher, Sweden now has a lower death rate per-capita than the US, which it achieved without the terrific economic damage still ongoing in the US. Sweden never closed restaurants, bars, sports, most schools, or movie theaters. The government never ordered people to wear masks. Dr. Yeadon speaks bitterly of the lives lost as a result of lockdown policies, and of the “savable” countless lives which will be further lost, from important surgeries and other healthcare deferred, should lockdowns be reimposed. Watch the full discussion by following this link. Yeadon’s warnings are confirmed by a new study from the Infectious Diseases Society of America., summarized succinctly in the following twitter thread from al gato malo (@boriquagato) Anyone still presuming that a Positive PCR test is showing a COVID case needs to read this very carefully: a lot of people still seem to not understand what this means, so let’s lay that out for a minute. PCR tests look for RNA. there is too little in your swab. so they amplify it using a primer based heating and annealing process. Each cycle of this process doubles the material the US (and much of the world) is using a 40 Ct (cycle threshold). so, 40 doublings, 1 trillion X amplification. This is absurdly high.   The way that we know this is by running this test, seeing the Ct to find the RNA, and then using the same sample to try to culture virus. If you cannot culture the virus, then the virus is “dead.” it’s inert. if it cannot replicate, it cannot infect you or others. it’s just traces of virus, remnants, fragments etc PCR is not testing for disease, it’s testing for a specific RNA pattern and this is the key pivot When you crank it up to 25, 70% of the positive results are not really “positives” in any clinical sense. i hesitate to call it a “false positive” because it’s really not. it did find RNA. but that RNA is not clinically relevant. It cannot make you or anyone else sick so let’s call this a non-clinical positive (NCP). no one can culture live virus past about 34 and we have known this since march. yet no one has adjusted these tests. presuming it bears out, this is a key finding. it shows that many patients that are PCR+ for COV-19 are not shedding infectious virus. this would imply shorter quarantine needed and provide a testable basis for discharge of isolated patients. pic.twitter.com/UvumjkxVxv — el gato malo (@boriquagato) March 27, 2020 This is more very strong data refuting the idea that you can trust a PCR+ as a clinical indicator. That is NOT what it’s meant for. at all. Using them to do real time epidemiology is absurd. The FDA would never do it, the drug companies doing vaccine trials would never do it… it’s because it’s nonsense. And this same test is used for “hospitalizations” and “death with covid” (itself a weirdly over inclusive metric) PCR testing is not the answer, it’s the problem. It’s not how to get control of an epidemic, it’s how to completely lose control of your data picture and wind up with gibberish and we have done this to ourselves before. The last major false positive pseudo-epidemic was Swine Flu in 2009. Everyone said we would never let it happen again. pic.twitter.com/Hdif5l5Gam — Dr Clare Craig (@ClareCraigPath) November 16, 2020 A quick word what this data does and does not mean. Saying “a sample requiring 35 Ct to test + has a 3% real clinical positive rate” does not mean “97% of + tests run at 35 Ct are NCP’s” People seem to get confused on this, so lets explain: Most tests are just amplified and run. they don’t test every cycle as these academics do. that would make the test slow and expensive, so you just run 40 cycles then test. Obviously, a real clinical positive (RCP) that would have been + at 20 is still + at 40. But when you run the tests each cycle as the academics do, that test would already have dropped out. So saying that only 3% at 35 are RCP really means that 3% of those samples not PCR + at 34 were PCR and RCP + at 35. This lets us infer little about overall NCP/RCP rate. So we cannot say “at 25 Ct, we have a 70 NCP rate.” in fact, it’s hard to say much of anything. it depends entirely on what the source material coming in looks like. You cannot even compare like to like. This is what i mean by “the data is gibberish” Today at 40 Ct, 7% PCR positive rate could be 1% RCP prevalence when that same thing meant 6% RCP prev in April. If there is lots more trace virus around, more people who have recovered and have fragments left over, etc this test could be finding virus you killed 4 months ago. So if we consider RCP rate/PCR+ rate, we would expect that number to drop sharply late in an epidemic because there is more dead virus around for PCR to find, but we have no idea what that ratio is or how it changes. This spills over in to deaths, reported hospitalization etc. Testing is being made out to be like the high beams on a car, but when it’s snowing like hell at night, that is the LAST thing you want. It is not illuminating our way, it’s blinding us. A bad inaccurate map is much worse than no map at all, and this is a world class bad map… We’re basing policy that is affecting billions of humans on data that is uninterpretable gibberish. It’s a deranged technocrat’s wet dream, but for those of us along for the ride, it’s a nightmare. Testing is not the solution, it’s the problem. Any technocrat or scientist that does not know this by now is either unfit for their job or has decided that they just don’t care and prefer power to morality. This is, of course, precisely the kind of person who winds up running a gov’t agency… oopsie. The head of the NIH is not the best scientist, it’s the best politician. All this wild and reckless government policy has never been about the science. It’s politics and panic. You can read the whole paper here: ciaa1491 by Zerohedge"

""If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted."" It's about to *go down* in Milwaukee & Dane counties.https://t.co/ynJZB2Ksuw pic.twitter.com/Ja70qrmjUc — Kyle Becker (@kylenabecker) November 18, 2020 The Epoch Times reported: The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday night issued an order to recount ballots in two counties following a request by President Donald Trump’s campaign. Commissioners in a video teleconference on Wednesday argued for nearly six hours before ultimately agreeing to conduct the recount. “An order will be issued mandating that the recount take place. This is not a discretionary decision. This is simply what will happen,” Chairwoman Ann Jacobs, a Democrat, said at the beginning of the hearing. But members of the commission, which has three Republicans and three Democrats, debated for hours over how the recount would be conducted. Some said state law governing a recount contained ambiguities. Republican Commissioner Dean Knudson said he believed the commission should issue guidance to canvassers that they should set aside ballots that had a correction made to the witness address. “They’ve essentially filed in advance a mass objection to all such ballots, that in this era of pandemic, and all our concerns for public health, and so on, it’s kind of ridiculous to have the observers have to be close enough to see each one and object individually to each one, when instead, we could give guidance at the outset that says, ‘hey, those need to be set aside, because those are going to be under litigation,’” Knudson said. “I don’t necessarily think that as a commission, we should be pre-determining what ballots are going to be questioned or what envelopes are going to be questioned. That’s not our position,” Democrat Commissioner Julie Glancey said, though the Republican Party of the Trump campaign could recommend canvassers do so. Knudson sparked stronger pushback when he wondered whether clerks sent out thousands of ballots that weren’t requested by voters as he proposed including written applications in the recount. “I am shocked and offended that you have implied in any way that clerks in Madison and Milwaukee have sent out thousands of unrequested ballots,” Jacobs said. “I think that’s absurd. I think it’s factually bizarre.” “What we ought not be doing is watering that plant of baloney,” she added, referring to allegations by the Trump campaign. The commission eventually approved an order that made no reference to its recount manual, which has guidelines for how local officials should conduct recounts. Trump’s campaign earlier in the day filed a petition asking for recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties because of alleged “illegally altered absentee ballots, illegally issued absentee ballots, and illegal advice given by government officials allowing Wisconsin’s voter ID laws to be circumvented.” “The Wisconsin Elections Commission directed Wisconsin municipal clerks to illegally alter incomplete absentee ballots contrary to Wisconsin law,” the campaign added. The commission has said clerks are required by guidance issued before the 2016 election to fix addresses. The campaign also alleged that clerks across the state issued absentee ballots to voters without requiring an application, in direct conflict with Wisconsin’s absentee voting safeguards. The campaign transferred $3 million to the state to cover the estimated cost of the partial recount. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden finished with 20,427 more votes than Trump, or 0.62 percent of the vote, according to unofficial statewide results. State law allows a candidate who ends up within 1 percent of the winner’s total to request a recount. If the margin is less than 0.25 percent, the state foots the bill, but if it’s between 0.25 percent and 1 percent, the requestee must. A full recount can still be requested. The commission chair will on Thursday issue the recount order, triggering a 13-day recount clock. Recount boards can meet as soon as Nov. 19 and no later than Nov. 21. All recounts must be completed and results filed with the commission by noon on Dec. 1, a day that also marks the deadline for the commission to certify results from the election. “We understand the eyes of the world will be on these Wisconsin counties over the next few weeks,” Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief election official, said in a statement. “We remain committed to providing information about the process and assisting our county clerks by providing facts on the mechanics of a recount and status updates.”"
"Anti-COVID Lockdown Protest in Germany: Over 700,000 Scientists, Citizens Demand End",19 NOV 2020,8841,"The people in Germany have had enough! They are fighting to prevent COVID lockdowns, and nearly 700,000 other scientists and citizens are joining the pushback.   The scene at an anti-covid lockdown protest in Berlin, Germany
pic.twitter.com/eIWqmliDZg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) November 19, 2020 Just The News reported: Six weeks after it was first published, the Great Barrington Declaration — an international pronouncement meant to shine light on what it calls the “damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies” — has garnered nearly 700,000 signatures from scientists, academics, doctors and citizens worldwide, with more signatories being added each day as a fresh spate of lockdowns continues across Europe and parts of the United States. Regional and nationwide lockdowns have been an international feature of the COVID-19 pandemic since almost the start of the year. At the outset of the pandemic, China instituted a severe lockdown of the Hubei province where the disease first originated. Global health officials were initially skeptical of the Chinese lockdown, which went against many major established pandemic guidelines. As the virus spread west into Europe and the United States, however, many heads of state began instituting their own lockdowns, with major countries such as Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom instituting broad stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns, school closures and other unprecedented policies in order to prevent a modeled catastrophic death toll.  In the United States, President Trump declined to impose a national lockdown, but throughout March and April governors and local leaders across the country issued their own shutdown orders, some of them lasting for months at a time. The ongoing fall spike of positive COVID-19 tests, meanwhile, has been followed by governors reimposing some of those measures after they were loosened over the summer. Lockdown policies ‘yield more damage than the disease itself’ Many public health officials, scientists, epidemiologists and other experts have been broadly supportive of these measures, with many arguing that they are necessary to avoid huge death rates, overwhelmed medical systems and destabilized societies. Yet the Great Barrington Declaration has, in the relatively brief period since its Oct. 4 publication, managed to snag several dozen thousand signatures from experts in those fields and others who believe the lockdowns are causing, in the words of the declaration, “irreparable damage.” “Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,” the document states. “The results … include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health — leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden.” The ideal policy, according to the signatories, is “to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.” “Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,” the document continues, arguing that “schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching” and “extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed.” Work should be in-person as well, it adds, while restaurants, storefronts, art exhibits and other cultural activities should be permitted to resume normal operations.  In many areas throughout the world, that advice has gone largely ignored over the past month and a half. Yet multiple signatories to the document this week still stood by their endorsement of its aims. Boris Kotchoubey, a medical psychology professor at the Universiy of Tubingen who has affixed his signature to the proclamation, told Just the News: “I signed the Declaration … because I share the views formulated in it.” “Anti-Corona measures in all countries that I know (mostly, West Europe) are non-directed, imprecise and, therefore, yield more damage than the disease itself,” he said. “Actually, we know more or less where the infection is spread,” he continued. “(1) big events like high level sport events, rock concerts etc.; (2) loud parties; (3) activities in closed rooms, particularly with screams or songs (worship); (4) public transportation, particularly in big cities; (5) last but not least invasion of the infection in retirement homes. “Efficient measures should be directed to the prevention of infection in THESE situations,” he wrote. “Instead, for example, the German  government forbids theaters and restaurants, although there is not the slightest evidence that anybody has been infected in such places, because all of them had highly developed sanitary concepts (e.g., since May all seats in theaters are at least 2 meters from each other;
etc.; the same in restaurants).” Rodney Sturdivant, another signatory and the director of Baylor University’s Statistical Consulting Center, echoed those criticisms of lockdown policies. Epidemiological research “does not reflect what has been reported and cited as justifying many policy decisions,” he told Just the News. He described the Declaration as “a call to return to public health practice supported by data and science.” “An important public health principle is to not ignore the totality of public health with fixation on a single aspect,” he said. “The consequences of doing so is catastrophic. We are already seeing the impacts: mental health issues, missed cancer treatments, missed immunizations, hunger, drug overdose, domestic abuse, incredible harm to children … the list is tragically long and preventable.” “Continuing with current approaches will lead to far more harm than Covid will produce,” he said. Apart from the Declaration itself, a variety of other health officials have warned of the effect that lockdowns are having on non-virus related aspects of public health. Parents in the U.S. over the course of the lockdowns here have reported “behavioral issues that previously their children had not exhibited,” WebMD Chief Medical Officer John Whyte told Fox News this week. Whyte attributed those issues to the “loneliness, anxiety and anger” he said many children are experiencing during school closures and stay-at-home orders. The New York Times last week, meanwhile, reported on the deleterious mental health effects that lockdowns can have on younger individuals. Recent research, for instance, suggests that adolescents in the Netherlands over the course of that country’s shutdown experienced “a significant increase in severe anxiety and sleeping problems,” the paper reported. Experts have also warned that delayed medical treatments could contribute to significant spikes in mortality following the eventual conclusion of the pandemic, at which point medical conditions normally detected by early screenings may have progressed too far to be adequately treated. Still, comparatively few health officials and scientists have spoken out publicly against lockdown measures. One motivation for staying silent might be fear of reprisal: Those who have been critical of the prevailing consensus of COVID shutdowns have often been publicly vilified as being insufficiently concerned about the pandemic. American surgical oncologist David Gorski, for instance, last month called the signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration “COVID-19 deniers,” comparing them to “creationists, HIV/AIDS denialists, and climate science deniers.” That sort of negative publicity can have adverse professional effects, as Sturdivant found out after he signed the Declaration. He shared with Just the News an email he received from some colleagues with whom he was participating in a “large multi-institution grant proposal.” The colleagues said that the stances of both the foundation funding the project and the project’s program officer could jeopardize the initiative’s success due to Sturdivant’s participation in the Declaration. “At this time, given the quick deadline for this project, we think it would be best to pause collaboration in light of what we know about this funder and program officer,” they wrote to Sturdivant. “We hope there will be opportunities to collaborate in the future.” Sturdivant said he eventually resumed working with those colleagues, but he said fear of opposing viewpoints is “too typical in academia.” “Fear/panic due to misreporting of data and science are resulting in actions that mislead people into a false notion about non-scientific ‘solutions’ that do not work,” Sturdivant said. The Great Barrington Declaration, he added, “comes at a critical time in trying to rectify these issues.”"
Governor Dictator Facing Impeachment As Michigan Has Had Enough,17 NOV 2020,5278,"Governor Gretchen Whitmer has out-socialized the rest of the democrat party with her arbitrary, un-scientific restrictions designed to destroy small business and clamp down the iron fist on the state.

According to a number of judicial rulings, she’s isn’t.] When asked about the criticism from Republican leaders, Whitmer said they have not been taking the pandemic seriously, noting a recent outbreak in the Legislature. “If they spent half as much time doing their jobs as they have criticizing how I’m doing mine, we would be in a much stronger position. Unfortunately, they haven’t shown real seriousness here,” Whitmer told News 8 Monday morning. “They won’t do a mask mandate. They can’t even wear masks themselves and they got COVID spreading through the Republican caucuses in both the Senate and in the House. Right now, they are on hunting break through December. We are in an urgent crisis.” The governor went on to call on lawmakers to do their jobs. “The Legislature could be meeting right now, passing legislation. They are on hunting break until December,” Whitmer said, referencing the two-week recess that lawmakers take every year around this time. “They have done very little over the course of the last nine months. We don’t have time to wait for people to start doing their jobs. I’m going to do mine and I’m going to use every tool available to do that.” A spokesperson for the Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield told News 8 last week sponsors of the GOP plan want the governor’s feedback but “they haven’t heard anything yet.” Whitmer said she has asked for the Republicans’ plan but they have not shared it with her. “We have looped them into our meetings. But in asking them what your plan is, what are your actions, they don’t have one,” she said. “That is precisely why we just can’t simply wait for people to come to the table. We have to act now. I will continue to make available information and opportunities to work together but I’m not going to wait for them to come back from hunting break. We have got lives on the line and we have to act.” Lawmakers, for their part, say they would be happy to go back to Lansing if there was something the legislative and executive branches could agree on. “We don’t take this lightly in any way, but anything that we do needs to be signed by the governor so we’re trying to do it at the onset of where can we work with each other on this issue,” Rep. Greg VanWoerkom, R-Norton Shores, said. “And (when) phone calls aren’t returned and emails aren’t returned, it becomes difficult to make progress on that. we will be ready at the moment’s notice and if we feel that the governor is willing to work with us in good faith in passing some more bills.” Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said in a Sunday statement the governor did not reach across the aisle for help and went at it alone. He said Senate Republicans will continue to work with the medical community on ways to fight the virus. Shirkey released the following statement Sunday night: “The health and safety of our communities is our top priority. The Senate Republicans have been engaged in thoughtful conversations with our doctors, hospitals, and the Whitmer administration on ways to combat the spread of this insidious virus and help support our healthcare workers. While we’re meeting in good faith, Gov. Whitmer was working on her own strategy that did not include input from the Senate Republicans and we see the result of her plans in this latest round of restrictions. “The Senate Republicans still have faith in our fellow citizens and encourage them to protect themselves and others by adhering to the practices we know can help combat the spread of this insidious virus: washing hands, maintaining distance, and wearing a mask when it’s appropriate. “We are disappointed that Gov. Whitmer chose to go it alone, again. The Senate Republicans will continue working with our doctors and the medical community on ways we can combat this virus and are ready to work with the Governor when she decides to work as a team to fight this virus.” Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey"
"CA Lawmakers Cancel Thanksgiving, Then Head Off To Maui With Lobbyists, Ignoring Travel Warnings",17 NOV 2020,4041,"In California, families have been told to essentially cancel their traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations. Extreme restrictions have been placed on citizens… but those apparent restrictions don’t apply to lawmakers. They’re heading off to a Maui getaway with lobbyists. Politico reported: The pandemic may have “canceled” 2020, but it did not derail an annual gathering of lobbyists and lawmakers on the shores of Maui that brought people from across the country to a luxury resort this week. Roughly 100 people from four states converged at the Fairmont Kea Lani for a four-day legislative conference organized by the Independent Voter Project, said the group’s chair and executive director, Dan Howle. The 18th annual event was a third of its regular size, Howle said, but it still drew nearly 20 lawmakers from California, Texas and Washington state. The theme? How to reopen states’ economies amid the public health crisis. [Bwhahahahahahahaha! Sure, right.] Howle said he was not concerned about the public health implications of bringing people from around the country together because of the stringent requirements in Hawaii’s mandatory Safe Travels program. To avoid a lengthy quarantine, visitors must provide proof of a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours of arrival. “It really doesn’t matter where you’re coming from as long as you have a negative Covid test before you arrive here,” he said. But tests aren’t infallible; they could provide the wrong result or fail to catch coronavirus during the incubation period. And there are risks to traveling because visitors could still face exposure on the island and bring the virus home. The event comes amid a worrisome surge in infections across the country and new travel restrictions on the West Coast, and as many schools and businesses remain closed. It also follows revelations by the San Francisco Chronicle that Gov. Gavin Newsom attended a 12-person birthday party at an exclusive Napa Valley restaurant, the French Laundry. “Fair to say that the timing isn’t great,” said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. “Anybody organizing an in-person event should think carefully about the optics, particularly in California, where the governor has just sent most of the state into purple. There’s a chance this will not be received well by the general public.” Howle emphasized that there would be no cocktail hours or impromptu hotel bar hangouts and that guests would be instructed not to move from table to table at meals, adding that masks would be required at all times except when eating or drinking. The event received special permission from the county to convene a group larger than 12 people, he said. He would not provide the names of any lawmakers in attendance, but the event often draws moderate Democrats. Assembly members Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove) and Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) attended last year, according to financial disclosures. Their offices did not respond to multiple queries Monday about whether they were in Hawaii this week. Lobbying powerhouses Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and the Western States Petroleum Association sat out the conference this year. A spokesperson for Edison cited internal nonessential travel restrictions during the pandemic. “Is it still on?” asked Kevin Slagle, from WSPA, before adding: “Nobody is going to Maui this year.” The conference is a fundraiser for the Independent Voter Project, the group behind the successful 2008 ballot measure that created a California’s nonpartisan primary. Howle also framed it as boon to the local economy and said it could prove that it’s possible to hold an event of that size safely. “At some point in time, you have to figure out a way for people to get back to some semblance of a normal life,” he said. “This is a good conference.” California lawmakers: Your Thanksgiving is CANCELLED Also California lawmakers: https://t.co/7q0bhmbNIj pic.twitter.com/IsBoxSQshz — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) November 17, 2020"
"Fauci: Even After Vaccine, Americans Aren’t Safe, Must Wear Masks",17 NOV 2020,1287,"Although ‘experts’ told everyone that a vaccine would be salvation from COVID, now, Anthony Fauci is claiming that Americans will still need to wear masks. The New York Post reported: Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday it will still be necessary to social distance, wear masks and take other COVID-19 precautions after a vaccine becomes available to Americans. “I would recommend to people to not to abandon all public health measures just because you’ve been vaccinated,” Fauci told CNN anchor Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “Because even though for the general population it might be 90 to 95 percent effective, you don’t necessarily know for you how effective it is.” The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases added that once he receives a vaccine, he still won’t feel comfortable completely letting down his guard. “I can feel more relaxed in essentially not having the stringency that we have right now, but I think abandoning it completely would not be a good idea,” Fauci said.

"Dominion Security Chief Advocated Antifa Violence, Hatred For Trump",16 NOV 2020,6609,"Many people, by now, have heard of Dominion voting systems’ ‘glitches,’ which miraculously transferred votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden on election night and afterward… miraculously, since none of the ‘glitches’ transferred votes from Biden to Trump. Now, however, more information about the systems has shown that is actually designed to do that. And, thanks to real investigative journalism, Americans have learned that the Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security chief for Dominion was a die-hard antifa supporter. Warning: Adult language The Spectator reported: 2010 Eric Coomer joined Dominion as Vice President of U.S. Engineering. According to his bio, Coomer graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. Eric Coomer was later promoted to Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security although Coomer has since been removed from the Dominion page of directors. In a stunning interview conducted by Michelle Malkin, Joe Oltman, FEC (Faith Education Commerce) United founder, reveals how he infiltrated Antifa and how during a conversation with Antifa members, he discovered “Eric from Dominion” was allegedly part of the chat during the week of September 27, 2020. Oltman explained that “Eric” was telling the Antifa members they needed to “keep up the pressure.” When Oltman asked, “Who’s Eric?” someone answered, “Eric, he’s the Dominion guy.” Oltman said that as the conversation continued, someone asked, “What are we gonna do if F*cking Trump wins?” Oltman paraphrased how Eric (the Dominion guy) responded, “Don’t worry about the election, Trump’s not gonna win. I made f*cking sure of that!” After Oltman, who runs a data company, finished the call, he started to investigate “Eric from Dominion,” in Denver, CO., and came upon Eric Coomer. Oltman admitted that it didn’t make sense that Eric Coomer would be the Antifa member on the call and that at the time, he knew nothing about Dominion Voting Systems. It wasn’t until after he started hearing about Dominion Voting Systems in the news following the election that he remembered the remarks made by “Eric from Dominion” on the Antifa chat. Oltman began digging into Eric Coomer, trying to find anything he could about him. Oltman finally hit gold when he was able to (legally) access what he claims is Dominion VP, Eric Coomer’s Facebook page. What he found was stunning. Joe Oltman said he never saw such hate and vitriol coming from someone who has a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. Oltman explained to Malkin that Coomer actually re-posted the Antifa manifesto to President Trump on his Facebook page. The Gateway Pundit posted  a copy of that Antifa letter to Trump in a previous report. Joe Oltman was removed from Twitter this week.  His tweets on Eric Coomer upset big tech. Oltman admits that by revealing this information about Coomer, he is putting himself in danger. He may have a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics, but when it comes to hiding his hatred for President Trump, Trump supporters, law enforcement, or even for Texans, Dominion’s Eric Coomer isn’t very smart. In 2017, when Coomer was in Nevada, he mocked President Trump’s Election Integrity Commission on Facebook. Coomer shared a Washington Post article titled, “The voting commission is a fraud itself. Shut it down.” The article, written by the unhinged Trump hater Jennifer Rubin, was an attack on President Trump’s May 11, 2017, Executive Order on the Establishment of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. What about Trump’s Election Integrity Commission triggered Coomer? Was it the part about “Vulnerabilities in voting systems and practices used for Federal elections that could lead to improper voter registrations and improper voting, including fraudulent voter registrations and fraudulent voting,” that caused Coomer to have a childish meltdown on his Facebook page? Dominion’s Director of Strategy and Security’s response to Rubin’s article appears to be a bit unhinged: “And in other news…There be some serious fuckery going on right here fueled by our Cheeto-in-chief stocking lie after lie on the flames of [former Kansas Sec. of State Chris] Kobach…You want something serious to worry about? This is it. “   Here’s what Coomer had to say to his “friends” on Facebook on July 21, 2016, who are Trump supporters. From Coomer’s Facebook post: Facebook friend land- open call- If you are planning to vote for the autocratic, narcissistic, fascists, ass-hat blowhard and his Christian jihadist VP pic, UNFRIEND ME NOW! No, I’m not joking. I’m all for reasoned political discourse and healthy debate- I’m looking at you ( 3 names of friends). I disagree with you three on many philosophical grounds but respect your opinions. Only and absolute FUCKING IDIOT could ever vote for that wind-bag fuck-tard FASCIST RACIST FUCK! No bullshit, I don’t give a damn if you’re friend, family, or random acquaintance, pull the lever, mark an oval, touch a screen for that carnival barker—UNFRIEND ME NOW. I have no desire whatsoever to ever interact with you. You are beyond hope, beyond reason. you are controlled by fear, reaction, and bullshit. Get your shit together. Oh, it that doesn’t persuade you, FUCK YOU! Seriously, this fucking ass-clown stands against everything that makes this country awesome! You want in on that? You deserve nothing but contempt. Near the bottom of his rant, Coomer clarifies: “These opinions are rational and completely my own. They are based in reason and highly credible. Though they are not necessarily the thoughts of my employer, though if not, I should probably find another job. Who wants to work for complete morons?” Comer appears to be trying to cover his tracks, “None of my personal opinions affect my professional conduct or attitudes,” adding, “I am non-partisan.” According to Oltman, Eric Coomer isn’t a big fan of the police. During his interview with Malkin, he shared several screenshots of anti-police rhetoric like an image a link to YouTube from the hip-hop song “Dead Prez.” Here’s a portion of the lyrics from the “Dead Prez” song in case it’s not on your personal playlist: Is there heaven for us hip-hop heathens
Big Pop and Pac, even Eazy had ’em leanin’
We all children lookin’ for a reason
What do you believe in, betrayal, treason?
I’m out for dead presidency
I’m out for dead presidency
I’m out for dead presidency
I’m out for dead fuckin’ presidents that represent me This screenshot, captured by Joel Oltman, makes one wonder if Eric’s not a fan of the United States either. It’s little wonder all the “glitches” transferred votes to Biden."
"Supreme Court Justice Outlines COVID Threat To Religious Freedom, Free Speech, And Rule Of Law",14 NOV 2020,9661,"Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has delivered a speech that exposes how COVID is being used to destroy three foundations of the United States Republic. PJ Media reported: In a Federalist Society speech on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito raised the alarm about threats to religious freedom, free speech, and the rule of law — threats exacerbated in the “constitutional stress-test” of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. These threats are by no means limited to lockdown restrictions and COVID-19 issues, but the virus has highlighted them. “The pandemic has resulted in previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty,” Alito said. “I am not diminishing the severity of the virus’s threat to public health, and putting aside what I will say shortly about a few Supreme Court cases, I’m not saying anything about the legality of COVID restrictions. All that I’m saying is this… we have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive, and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020.” Alito mentioned many “live events that would otherwise be protected by the right to freedom of speech” that state and local governments have prohibited, including the fact that churches were closed on Easter Sunday by government fiat. “The COVID crisis has served as a sort of constitutional stress-test. And in doing so it has highlighted disturbing trends that were already present before the virus struck,” the justice argued. Alito first highlighted “the dominance of lawmaking by executive fiat rather than legislation.” He rightly traced this idea back to “the vision of early twentieth-century progressives and the New Dealers of the 1930s … that policy-making would shift from narrow-minded elected legislators to an elite group of elected experts, in a word, that policymaking would become more scientific.” For instance, a Nevada law gives the state’s governor extraordinary powers. If the governor finds that there is “a natural, technological, or manmade emergency or disaster of major proportions, the governor can perform and exercise such functions, powers, and duties as are necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.” Yet the Supreme Court has a duty to step in “whenever fundamental rights are restricted.” Along those lines, Alito warned that religious freedom has grown increasingly out of favor. “It pains me to say this but in certain quarters, religious liberty is fast becoming a disfavored right,” he lamented. He briefly mentioned the Supreme Court case Employment Division v. Smith and Congress’s passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. The House of Representatives unanimously passed the bill, while the Senate passed it, 97-3. President Bill Clinton signed it into law. “Today, that widespread support has vanished. When states have considered or gone ahead and adopted their own versions of RFRA, they have been threatened with punishing economic boycotts,” Alito said. He also briefly covered recent Supreme Court cases illustrating the threat to religious freedom. Alito mentioned the Little Sisters of the Poor, “women who have dedicated their lives to caring for the elderly poor, regardless of religion.” Some of their beneficiaries have testified that the Little Sisters “will keep you alive for ten years longer.” “Despite this inspiring work, the Little Sisters have been under unrelenting attack for the better part of a decade. Why? Because they refuse to allow their health insurance plan to provide contraceptives to their employees. For that, they were targeted by the prior administration,” the justice noted. The Obama administration threatened the Little Sisters with hefty fines “if they did not knuckle under and violate a tenet of their faith.” While the group of nuns won a Supreme Court case last spring, the case went back to the Court of Appeals. President Donald Trump created a religious freedom exemption in the contraception mandate, but Joe Biden has pledged to drop that exemption. In another case, the State of Washington required pharmacies to carry all contraceptives, including the morning-after pill. The Christian pharmacy Ralph’s refused to carry that abortifacient pill, but it gladly referred women to nearby pharmacies that did carry it. The state decided that this work-around was not enough. Alito also mentioned Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop who notoriously refused to bake a cake celebrating a same-sex wedding. He cited a member of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission who said that freedom of religion had been used “to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust, we can list hundreds of situations where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination.” “For many today, religious liberty is not a cherished freedom. It’s often just an excuse for bigotry, and it cannot be tolerated,” Alito warned. He mentioned that not a single employee of the Little Sisters has asked for contraception, no woman lacks contraception because of Ralph’s, and no same-sex couple has failed to get a cake because of Jack Phillips. “A great many Americans disagree, sometimes quite strongly, with the religious beliefs of the Little Sisters, the owners of Ralph’s, and Jack Phillips. They have a perfect right to do so. That is not the question. The question we face is whether our society will be inclusive enough to tolerate people with unpopular religious beliefs,” the justice noted. Alito cited Harvard Law professor Mark Tushnet, who notoriously wrote, “The culture wars are over. They lost, we won.” Terrifyingly, the professor compared social conservatives to the defeated Axis powers in World War II. “My own judgment is that taking a hard line (‘You lost, live with it’) is better than trying to accommodate the losers, who – remember – defended, and are defending, positions that liberals regard as having no normative pull at all,” he argued. “Trying to be nice to the losers didn’t work well after the Civil War, nor after Brown. (And taking a hard line seemed to work reasonably well in Germany and Japan after 1945.)” This hostility to traditional religion has bled into COVID-19 restrictions. Alito referenced a Supreme Court decision on Nevada’s restrictions upholding the state’s double standard on casinos and houses of worship. The governor opened casinos — some of which are truly humongous — at 50 percent capacity while restricting religious services to 50 people or fewer. “If you want to worship and you’re the 51st person in line, sorry, you are out of luck. The size of the building doesn’t matter, nor does it matter if you wear a mask or stay 6 feet apart.” “The state’s message is this: forget about worship and head for the slot machines or maybe a Cirque du Soleil show,” Alito said. “Take a quick look at the Constitution. You will see the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment which protects religious liberty. You will not find a craps clause, or a blackjack clause, or a slot machine clause,” the justice quipped. “Nevada was unable to provide any plausible justification for treating casinos more favorably than houses of worship, but the Court nevertheless deferred to the governor’s judgment, which just so happened to favor the state’s biggest industry and the many voters it employs.” The justice contrasted this “blatant discrimination” against religious freedom with a Maryland district judge’s decision to strike down an FDA rule providing that women who want medication abortions must go to a clinic in person to access them. The judge struck down this rule in the name of protecting women from COVID-19, even though Gov. Larry Hogan (R-Md.) had allowed people to go to gyms, casinos, and hair and nail salons in a limited reopening at the time. Alito also warned that “support for freedom of speech is also in danger and COVID rules have restricted speech in unprecedented ways.” While coronavirus lockdowns have shut down attendance at speeches, conferences, lectures, rallies, and more, “even before the pandemic, there was growing hostility to the expression of unfavorable views.” Alito quipped that there are “seventy times seven” things that Americans cannot say if they are students or professors at a college or university, or employees speaking for a corporation. “You can’t say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Until very recently, that’s what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now, it’s considered bigotry,” he warned. “That this would happen after our decision in Obergefell [the 2015 case striking down state laws on marriage] should not have come as a surprise. Yes, the opinion of the Court included words meant to calm the fears of those who cling to traditional views on marriage. But I could see, and so did the other justices in dissent, where the decision would lead,” Alito warned. He quoted his own dissent in the case, “I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes. But if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and being treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.” “That is just what is coming to pass,” the justice lamented. Indeed, in one recent case, the Kroger Company fired two women in Little Rock, Ark., who refused to wear a rainbow-colored heart emblem on an apron because they did not want to endorse LGBT activism. Religious freedom and free speech are indeed under assault in America today, and even if the coronavirus pandemic fades away tomorrow, these threats to fundamental rights will persist."
Dem Mayor Orders Citizens To Cancel Thanksgiving Plans,13 NOV 2020,2229,"In Chicago, apparently Lori Lightfoot thinks that free American citizens are her subjects and must obey her arbitrary orders. She has told residents that they must cancel Thanksgiving plans. Breitbart News reported: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) on Thursday issued a stay-at-home advisory and called on residents to cancel their “traditional” Thanksgiving plans as part of an effort to combat the spread of coronavirus. Lightfoot announced advisory will take effect on Monday, November 16th, and will last 30 days. The mayor urged residents to avoid traveling, hosting house guests, or leaving their resident for non-essential business. – Stay home unless for essential reasons
– Stop having guests over—including family members you do not live with
– Avoid non-essential travel
– Cancel traditional Thanksgiving plans — Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) November 12, 2020 In October, Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker (D) ordered Chicago restaurants and bars to stop serving customers indoors and limited gatherings to 25 people or 25 percent capacity. Lightfoot is the latest Democrat to seek to curb residents’ activities going into the holiday season. Cases have surged in New York, where Cuomo announced Wednesday that new restrictions would go into effect Friday. Private indoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people, and gyms, bars and restaurants must close each night at 10 p.m. The curfew will apply only to restaurants licensed by the state liquor authority. Others may provide take-out after 10 p.m. Cuomo told reporters the spread of the virus is mostly happening at bars, restaurants, gyms and house parties. “COVID is getting worse by the day. All around the country. The fall surge is here. We are taking action but we need New Yorkers to do their part. Wear a mask. Get tested. Follow all health guidelines. Take this seriously,” he tweeted.

MS Gov Declares War On Biden Lockdown Scheme: “Not Going To Participate”,13 NOV 2020,2729,"In Mississippi, the governor has just declared war on any democrat scheme to lockdown the nation, destroying lives. Experts cite the massive voter fraud and legal challenges that show Donald Trump as the clear winner of the election, so it’s likely that Mississippi won’t be called on to make that stand. Fox 8 Live reported: In a press conference on Thursday, Gov. Tate Reeves said Mississippi would not participate in a nationwide lockdown if one is mandated by … Joe Biden. He said that while the election results have yet to be determined, the state would not shut down its economy again, even if mandated by the federal government. “We are not going to participate in a nationwide lockdown,” he said, adding that closing the economy for six weeks would be “totally and completely beyond reasonableness.” He went on to say that he hopes to work with the next president, whoever that is, in other ways to help prevent the spread of the virus. … According to a Nov. 11 report from CNBC, members of Biden’s COVID-19 advisory team say shutting down businesses for four to six weeks to help drive down the number of new cases. Reeves, though, said the residents in the Magnolia State cannot shut down their restaurants, gyms or other businesses for the next six weeks, “come back and flip a switch, and everything will be fine,” he said. “That’s not how the economy works.” The governor also used his press conference to give an update on his family, days after his daughter tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he and his wife, Elee, have continued to test negative for the virus, and revealed that Mississippi had 1,271 new cases reported Thursday. Wednesday, more than 1,250 tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, Reeves said he has signed an additional executive order, extending his previous Safe Recovery Order, and extending or implementing mask mandates for 15 counties. The order was signed on Tuesday. However, Reeves did not announce it and canceled a press conference that day after finding out his youngest daughter was confirmed positive. The governor’s comments come hours after State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs announced in a tweet that there are no ICU beds available in Jackson and very few available elsewhere. During a virtual town hall Thursday, Dobbs urged Mississippians to social distance, wear masks and wash their hands in order to slow the spread of this virus. Also on Thursday, Germantown High School and the entire Lawrence County School District announced that they will be going virtual due to an increasing number of COVID-19 cases among the students. Brandon High School will also be going virtual starting Friday, November 13. Students will return after the Thanksgiving holiday."
Trump Leads With Strength! Deal Cut With Major Pharmacies To Provide COVID Vaccine Free,13 NOV 2020,3680,"Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and continued efforts for the American people, the White House announced that the COVID vaccine (swiftly developed thanks to President Trump’s actions) will be available at major pharmacies for free. Breaking 911 reported: To maximize access to COVID-19 vaccines for all Americans, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced the U.S. government’s partnerships with large chain pharmacies and networks that represent independent pharmacies and regional chains. Through the partnership with pharmacy chains, this program covers approximately 60 percent of pharmacies throughout the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Through the partnerships with network administrators, independent pharmacies and regional chains will also be part of the federal pharmacy program, further increasing access to vaccine across the country—particularly in traditionally underserved areas. “Ensuring access and affordability of the COVID-19 vaccine for all Americans is a top priority for the Trump Administration,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “We are leveraging the existing private sector infrastructure to get safe and effective vaccines supported by Operation Warp Speed into communities and into arms as quickly as possible with no out-of-pocket costs. The vast majority of Americans live within five miles of a pharmacy, and our new agreement with pharmacy partners across America is a critical step toward making sure all Americans have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines when they are available.” In addition to traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmacy interns, and pharmacy technicians also provide vaccinations in retail and grocery stores. Therefore, pharmacy vaccinators are crucial public health partners for increasing access and convenience of COVID-19 vaccines. Many pharmacists and the interns and technicians working under their supervision are trained to provide immunizations and are already important immunizers in their communities. Pharmacists are also a trusted health resource in their communities, and have played a vital role in the public health response to COVID-19 by counseling patients, expanding access to childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, and ordering and administering COVID-19 tests.  By working with these partners, the federal government will rapidly expand access to COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine will be administered at partners’ pharmacy locations at no cost to patients. “Since 2012, CDC has worked extensively with pharmacies to improve pandemic preparedness, conduct vaccine throughput exercises, and assess store and organizational response capabilities,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.  “Through these partnerships, we will leverage established relationships to support our critical public health mission of vaccinating the American public to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” Pharmacies that do not participate in the federal allocation program are encouraged to be part of the solution and should coordinate with their jurisdiction’s health department to become COVID-19 vaccine providers. Below is the list of chain and community-pharmacies networks that have signed on as of November 6 Currently, there are no COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized or approved by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to the CDC.  However, this pharmacy partnership is being established in anticipation that one or more COVID-19 vaccines will be authorized or approved and recommended for use in the United States before the end of 2020."
"New York Bar Orders Mandatory Vaccine, No Religious Or Personal Exemptions",12 NOV 2020,2130,"According to the New York State Bar Association, letting people choose whether or not to accept a foreign, brand new vaccine, is not an option. It must be mandatory. Interestingly, mainstream media outlets didn’t cover this shocking abuse of state power. Info Wars reported: This past Saturday The New York State bar association pushed new policy to lean pressure on New Yorkers to volunteer to be vaccinated by passing a policy that would make getting the Covid vaccination mandatory if it’s not taken by enough people. If it is determined necessary, New Yorkers won’t have the option to turn down the vaccination even if they have philosophical, religious, or personal reasons to not take it. The New York Bar ruling includes assessing ‘heath threats’ to all the communities so that the mandate could be targeted to more effected areas, “perhaps.” “The New York State Bar Association (NYSBA) is recommending that the state consider mandating a COVID-19 vaccine once a scientific consensus emerges that it is safe, effective and necessary. But before taking this significant step, the state government should conduct a public awareness campaign to urge voluntary vaccination.” State Bar Passes Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Recommendation | New York Law Journal https://t.co/u4F5yqWsO3 — Kate Metzger Ł    (@CryptoNewsFlash) November 9, 2020 This resolution, which passed with a majority in the 277-member New York Bar Association, ‘ starts the state of New York and the nation down a very slippery road.’ When the New York Bar conducts these health checks they can decide to mandate the Covid Vaccination either to designated zones or to all residents of New York State. Those who have been fighting mandatory vaccine policies took a major hit, and now have to face the very real possibility that such a policy will spread from state to state until the entire country is required to be vaccinated for Covid-19. With the number of cases again on the rise both nationally and statewide, the association is asking the state to: “WHAT’S NEXT,” says the Washington Sentinel. “The CHIP of course, which is on the agenda for Q1 2021.”"
"January Emails Show Fauci Approving, Supporting China’s COVID ‘Response’",12 NOV 2020,6143,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is a deep state actor bent on the destruction of the United States in order to enrich himself, evidence suggests. Not only did he tell Americans that mask weren’t necessary, evidence shows that his agency funded the Wuhan ‘research.’ Now, Judicial Watch has been awarded email documents showing his support of China’s ‘response’ to the virus back in January. Judicial Watch reported: Judicial Watch announced today that it and the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) received from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 300 pages of emails of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, including his approval of a press release supportive of China’s response to the 2019 novel coronavirus. On January 27, 2020, the World Health Organization/World Bank convened the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB). The following day, the GPMB Secretariat writes an email with the subject line “TIME SENSITIVE Message from GPMB Co-Chairs: review of draft GPMB Statement on 2019-novel coronavirus:” There was consensus for the GPMB to issue a statement supportive of countries’ (especially China) and WHO response efforts, and to call for urgent actions to further strengthen global preparedness and response to this outbreak. Please find attached a draft GPMB Statement. On January 29, Fauci responds: Looks fine. Please see my comments in attached document.
Thanks,
Tony The emails were produced in response to a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed May 4, 2020, on behalf of the DCNF in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Daily Caller News Foundation v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (No. 1:20-cv-01149)). The lawsuit was filed after HHS failed to respond to an April 1, 2020, FOIA request from the DCNF asking for: The time period for the request is January 1, 2020 to April 1, 2020. Many of the emails consist of missives to large groups of recipients, including Fauci, from Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, which describes itself as “an independent monitoring and accountability body to ensure preparedness for global health crises” convened by the World Health Organization and the World Bank The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB) convened on 27 January 2020 to discuss the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV which was first detected in Wuhan, China and is now quickly spreading internationally. The Board commends the speed of the response so far by countries and the World Health Organization (WHO), the transparency of China in sharing information and the genome sequence of the virus, and the strong collaboration between China and affected countries and with WHO. As the head of an agency that would play an important role in addressing this new viral outbreak, either by undertaking or funding research, or both, I take great pleasure in inviting you to this meeting. It appears that when Fauci discovered what Handley had done, he countermanded his decision by having HHS Director of the Office of Global Affairs Garrett Grigbsy send an email informing two individuals, apparently at WHO, that Lane would be coming to China: I just talked to Dr. Fauci and there must have been some communication mix up about Cliff. Cliff Lane is absolutely going to China as part of the WHO team (if invited). [Emphasis in original] Ahead of the GPMB Board call on Wednesday, I’m pleased to attach a note (on behalf of Jeremy Farrar, Victor Dzau and a small working group) setting out the urgent need for new funding for the global COVID-19 response. You will have seen the strong announcement today from the World Bank of up to $12 bn to support country response, which we warmly welcome. We are asking for your feedback on the call and consideration for the GPMB to launch an “ask” this week regarding needs not likely to be covered by the World Bank announcement – this would target the leaders and policy makers of other financing institutions and G7/G20 nations…The aim of the note is to encourage an immediate and full response to the needs of the world, recognizing that many countries are not well prepared and could be left behind. Thank you for your input on the call yesterday regarding the COVID-19 funding request that the GPMB will be making to multilateral financing institutions and G7/G20 nations. In this regard I attach: An updated background note revising the ask to $8bn as a result of removing the [redacted] we had previously included for strengthening country preparedness, given the World Bank announcement “The government is now ever so slowly complying with the law and letting the American people know how they did business with the WHO and China at the outset of this pandemic,” said Daily Caller News Foundation President Neil Patel. “We are grateful to Judicial Watch for helping us force the government to do its job.” “These Fauci emails show how praising China was the odd priority of the WHO in the face of a novel and dangerous coronavirus,” said Judicial Watch Tom Fitton. “That the NIH tried to slow-roll the release of these emails and is still sitting on thousands more is a scandal.” On September 22, U.S. District Court Judge Dabney L. Friedrich ordered HHS to begin processing 300 pages of emails per month beginning on October 21. In a September 21 court filing, HHS said the agency could begin producing 300 pages of responsive records to the Daily Caller News Foundation beginning on November 30, eight months after receiving the Daily Caller’s request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The total number of responsive records is approximately 4,200, which would have pushed off the full release of the records until at least 2022. HHS also alleged that Fauci must personally review each one of his emails before they are released. Judicial Watch announced that it & @DailyCaller received from the Dept of Health & Human Services 300 pages of emails of Dr. #Fauci including his approval of a press release supportive of #China’s response to the 2019 novel coronavirus.

State “Recording” Glitch Overturns Election From Democrat to GOP House Rep In Connecticut,12 NOV 2020,3712,"With the Dominion machines ‘counting’ votes, it’s little wonder that many experts are crying foul in various races across the country. Another “glitch” caused a race in Connecticut to be overturned, giving House republicans another seat. Breitbart News reported: Connecticut GOP House Rep. Craig Fishbein was declared the loser in the race for his seat until a town clerk found an “error” had caused the race to be called for his Democrat opponent. Wallingford town clerk Barbara Thompson said Tuesday her office discovered that votes had not been recorded in the state’s reporting system from Yalesville Elementary School, reported CT Mirror. The school is one of nine polling places in the 90th House District that includes Wallingford and Cheshire. “I can’t answer if it was a clerical error or a computer error in the elections management system,” Thompson said. “All I know is we caught it yesterday and amended it.” As of Wednesday morning, unofficial results on the secretary of state’s elections website showed incumbent Fishbein ahead of challenger Jim Jinks, but, according to the Mirror, a recount will be conducted Thursday because of a margin of less than 0.50 percent. “There’s no circumstance when an error like that is not caught and corrected,” Gabe Rosenberg, a spokesman for the secretary of the state, said. The Mirror further reported: Normally due within 48 hours after an election, the deadline for reporting final results was extended this year to 96 hours due to the expected heavy use of absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effective deadline was Monday, the first business day after the 96 hours. Less clear was how the campaigns of Fishbein and Jinks were misled. The campaigns rely on results obtained at the polls, not the number posted on the state’s election site. If Fishbein ultimately retains his seat, Democrats in the state will still maintain firm control of the legislative agenda in Connecticut, since they picked up seven House seats and two Senate seats, according to reported results. During the pandemic, Gov. Ned Lamont (D) and his administration worked to waive regulations for the use of absentee ballots to ensure more voters could cast their ballots by mail. The election in the state saw more than 650,000 people vote by “absentee ballot without an excuse.” State House Speaker-designate Matt Ritter said he plans to focus in on suburban zoning reform, marijuana legalization, early voting, and a public health insurance option in the coming legislative session. Amid President Donald Trump’s claims of voter fraud in some states due, in part, to mail-in ballots, Connecticut’s U.S. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy joined with Secretary of State Denise Merrill Friday to urge the state legislature to pass an amendment to the Constitution to allow regular vote-by-mail and early voting. Currently, Connecticut’s constitution does not allow early voting or mail-in voting. This year, during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Lamont said in April that, due to his “stay-at-home rule,” he was “going to have to find a way people can vote — and especially seniors — so they don’t have to leave their houses and go vote.” “So, obviously the voting by mail makes a lot of sense to me,” Lamont said. “Now, I need the lawyers to figure out how to draft that.” With the pandemic as background, Merrill sent every voter in the state, unsolicited, an application for an absentee ballot. The state Constitution, however, would need to be amended to allow mail-in and early voting for any reason at all. “Connecticut is in the Neanderthal era,” Blumenthal said, just as mail-in ballots are a focus of intense controversy in the presidential election."
Trump Caravan Heading To DC: President Calls On Supporters For Million MAGA March,10 NOV 2020,3129,"President Trump needs his supporters to help spread the word about the coordinated theft the election, and a million MAGA march has been scheduled. News Wars reported: He needs to see your strength in person that will in turn give him strength to fight this attempted coup against the United States of America by multinational forces who are trying to bring it down from within. Make no mistake, the time to stand up is now. Otherwise, prepare for nationwide lockdowns, the destruction of the economy, the loss of jobs – including perhaps your own – and the increasing cost of raising a family due to the exploding costs of healthcare and housing. If you don’t stand up now, get ready for the erosion of your rights to appease multinationals who could not care less about the values and liberties of the United States and its Constitution.  They could not care less about your day-to-day struggles. In fact, they’re cheering against you. … If you voted for President Trump, your vote is being cancelled by multinationals who are saying “no, your vote isn’t right, we will decide who runs the United States, not you.” They want you to believe that your vote doesn’t count and that you’re going to be oppressed and there’s nothing you can do about it. But tyrants can only push until people start pushing back. Now is the time to push back – peacefully and lawfully – and defend your vote and for you to decide what direction the United States will take. President Trump has sacrificed a lot to stand in the way between you and them. Now it’s time to stand behind him to show how much you appreciate his efforts, how much you care for the county and how much you value yourself, your life and your liberty. This is a historic time for the nation that hasn’t been seen in decades – and probably won’t be seen again for decades. Don’t waste this moment. Please look at the map and the schedule we’ve provided for you here so you can decide when to join our historic caravan.

Detroit Dems Block Windows In Banana Republic Move To Stop Anyone From Seeing Rig,5 NOV 2020,3313,"Last night, democrat poll workers covered the windows in Detroit in a Banana Republic move that has stunned Americans. And although they are doing their utmost to cheat, President Trump is still winning in Michigan. Breitbart News reported: Absentee ballot counting in Detroit descended into chaos on Wednesday when hundreds of unofficial Republican observers concerned about fraud converged on the counting location. The city of Detroit is using the TCF Center — formerly Cobo Hall — to count all of the absentee ballots in the city. Republicans and Trump supporters grew alarmed as Trump was holding a strong lead in the state during early counting Tuesday evening, only for it to evaporate as mailed-in ballots were counted in historically Democrat areas. Several videos posted on social media show workers attempting to restrict transparency and not allow people outside to observe what was going on inside the counting area: Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found The scene at Detroit’s absentee ballot counting center is growing more heated.

A few poll challengers / workers tell us they feel there wasn’t a fair number of (Republicans and Democrats) in this room.” The Trump campaign has filed suit, arguing they were not given access to the counting process and were thus demanding the vote be stopped until adequate accommodations were granted.

GOP Flips Democrat Strongholds In Florida Congressional Race,4 NOV 2020,1575,"Two republican candidates took House seats from democrats in Florida last night. The Daily Caller reported: Republican candidates Carlos Jimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar beat two Democratic incumbents for the U.S. House in Florida. Gimenez beat out incumbent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, Salazar beat out Democrat incumbent Donna Shalala of Florida’s 27th Congressional District, according to the Associated Press and  WSVN. The two faced off in a rematch after Shalala won in 2018. Shalala previously served as Health and Human Services secretary under President Bill Clinton, while Salazar is a journalist who focused on Latin America, according to CBS 4 Miami. Trump also endorsed Salazar, saying she was “badly needed in Washington.” Maria is badly needed in Washington. She is an outstanding person who truly loves her Country and her State. Her opponent, @DonnaShalala, is a political hack who is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi. She does nothing for Florida. Maria has my Complete & Total Endorsement! https://t.co/4GumAgOA3J — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2020 Over in Florida’s 26th congressional district, Gimenez had 52% of the vote over Mucarsel-Powell with 95% of precincts reporting, according to CBS 4 Miami. Gimenez, the mayor of Miami-Dade, celebrated his win. “Today was a rejection of extremism, today was a rejection of partisanship and today was a rejection of socialism,” Gimenez said, per the same report. “This country needs to start to work together because it has threats both inside and outside.”"
Hillary Brings Fauci “To Tears” As “Love” Letters Surface,3 NOV 2020,1935,"[Although this article appeared in February, it’s important to remember and recognize the mindset of the man who is supposedly dictating our Nation’s health policy.] Anthony Fauci hates President Trump and “loves” Hillary… so is it any wonder that he was adamant about telling Americans not to worry about COVID, but then reversing his position to encourage panic and shut downs? Conservative Treehouse has released the “love” letters Fauci wrote: I knew there was something sketchy about Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Within the WikiLeaks HRC email files there are letters from Fauci to Hillary Clinton through her aid/lawyer Cheryl Mills: “rarely does a speech bring me to tears”?… “please tell her I love her more than ever”?… “please tell her that we all love her”… “Please tell her that we all love her and are very proud to know her.”  LOOK: (LINK) A few months later: (LINK) Now, pause for a moment – reread that again – don’t skip past it. Think about what type of mindset would send such a letter and communication. Apply common sense. Trust your instincts… Would a person of reasonable disposition send such a letter or email to anyone in their professional network? Would you ever consider writing a letter to your employer, or the family of your employer, declaring your undying love and devotion toward them? “rarely does a speech bring me to tears”?… “please tell her I love her more than ever”?.. “please tell her that we all love her”… etc. Seriously…. think about it. If you have ever engaged in a large system, large business, or large network of professionals, how would you react to a person inside that organization who was sending such non-professional communication? What exactly does that say about the emotional stability of such a person? And this person, right now, with this inherent sensibility, has the most consequential and direct influence over the decision-making for the world’s most powerful nation. Stunning."
Archbishop: Trump Must Save Humanity From “Global Elite” Plotting “Great Reset”,3 NOV 2020,13635,"It seems that there is at least one man in the Catholic Church who is willing to stand for the Word of God and deliver powerful truths about what is happening on a global scale right now. Italian Archibishop Carlo Maria Vigano has penned another scathing letter to President Donald Trump, warning him of the “global” evil that seeks to usher in slavery for God’s people and the world. Zero Hedge reported: The Italian archbishop best known for confronting Pope Francis over the Vatican’s willful blindness to priests who abuse boys has written a letter in which he lashes out at the “global elite,” prompting some to accuse him of sympathizing with the “QAnon” movement of conspiracy theorists. The letter, penned by Archibishop Carlo Maria Vigano, formerly the Vatican’s ambassador to the US, attacks a shadowy “global elite,” that is plotting a “Great Reset” intended to undermine “God and humanity.” This same group, the archbishop argued, is also responsible for the lockdowns that have restricted movement and freedom around the globe, eliciting protests in many European capitals. “The fate of the whole world is being threatened by a global conspiracy against God and humanity,” Viganò wrote in the letter, which comes just days before the US election, which the archbishop wrote was of “epochal importance.” “No one, up until last February,” Viganò writes, “would ever have thought that, in all of our cities, citizens would be arrested simply for wanting to walk down the street, to breathe, to want to keep their business open, to want to go to church on Sunday. Yet now it is happening all over the world, even in picture-postcard Italy that many Americans consider to be a small enchanted country, with its ancient monuments, its churches, its charming cities, its characteristic villages.” Viganò adds: “And while the politicians are barricaded inside their palaces promulgating decrees like Persian satraps, businesses are failing, shops are closing, and people are prevented from living, traveling, working, and praying.” Working to protect the world from this group of elites seeking to recast society in a secular, totalitarian model, Viganò portrays President Trump as “the final garrison against the world dictatorship”. Viganò cast Trump’s opponent, Vice President Joe Biden, as “a person who is manipulated by the deep state.” Analysts who monitor “QAnon” conspiracy theories and their spread online warned the mainstream press that the letter had been widely discussed on various QAnon message boards, and had been disseminated in languages including Portuguese, Spanish, French, German and Italian, according to Yahoo News. Over the summer, Trump tweeted an earlier letter penned by the archbishop, and encouraged his supporters to read it. So honored by Archbishop Viganò’s incredible letter to me. I hope everyone, religious or not, reads it! https://t.co/fVhkCz89g5 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2020 In the past, Viagnò has accused Pope Francis of sweeping the child abuse crisis under the rug, and moving to protect homosexual priests, part of a “homosexual current” flowing through the Vatican. Read the full letter below: * * * DONALD J. TRUMP Sunday, October 25, 2020 Solemnity of Christ the King Mr. President, Allow me to address you at this hour in which the fate of the whole world is being threatened by a global conspiracy against God and humanity. I write to you as an Archbishop, as a Successor of the Apostles, as the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America. I am writing to you in the midst of the silence of both civil and religious authorities. May you accept these words of mine as the “voice of one crying out in the desert” (Jn 1:23). As I said when I wrote my letter to you in June, this historical moment sees the forces of Evil aligned in a battle without quarter against the forces of Good; forces of Evil that appear powerful and organized as they oppose the children of Light, who are disoriented and disorganized, abandoned by their temporal and spiritual leaders. Daily we sense the attacks multiplying of those who want to destroy the very basis of society: the natural family, respect for human life, love of country, freedom of education and business. We see heads of nations and religious leaders pandering to this suicide of Western culture and its Christian soul, while the fundamental rights of citizens and believers are denied in the name of a health emergency that is revealing itself more and more fully as instrumental to the establishment of an inhuman faceless tyranny. A global plan called the Great Reset is underway. Its architect is a global élite that wants to subdue all of humanity, imposing coercive measures with which to drastically limit individual freedoms and those of entire populations. In several nations this plan has already been approved and financed; in others it is still in an early stage. Behind the world leaders who are the accomplices and executors of this infernal project, there are unscrupulous characters who finance the World Economic Forum and Event 201, promoting their agenda. The purpose of the Great Reset is the imposition of a health dictatorship aiming at the imposition of liberticidal measures, hidden behind tempting promises of ensuring a universal income and cancelling individual debt. The price of these concessions from the International Monetary Fund will be the renunciation of private property and adherence to a program of vaccination against Covid-19 and Covid-21 promoted by Bill Gates with the collaboration of the main pharmaceutical groups. Beyond the enormous economic interests that motivate the promoters of the Great Reset, the imposition of the vaccination will be accompanied by the requirement of a health passport and a digital ID, with the consequent contact tracing of the population of the entire world. Those who do not accept these measures will be confined in detention camps or placed under house arrest, and all their assets will be confiscated. Mr. President, I imagine that you are already aware that in some countries the Great Reset will be activated between the end of this year and the first trimester of 2021. For this purpose, further lockdowns are planned, which will be officially justified by a supposed second and third wave of the pandemic. You are well aware of the means that have been deployed to sow panic and legitimize draconian limitations on individual liberties, artfully provoking a world-wide economic crisis. In the intentions of its architects, this crisis will serve to make the recourse of nations to the Great Reset irreversible, thereby giving the final blow to a world whose existence and very memory they want to completely cancel. But this world, Mr. President, includes people, affections, institutions, faith, culture, traditions, and ideals: people and values that do not act like automatons, who do not obey like machines, because they are endowed with a soul and a heart, because they are tied together by a spiritual bond that draws its strength from above, from that God that our adversaries want to challenge, just as Lucifer did at the beginning of time with his “non serviam.” Many people – as we well know – are annoyed by this reference to the clash between Good and Evil and the use of “apocalyptic” overtones, which according to them exasperates spirits and sharpens divisions. It is not surprising that the enemy is angered at being discovered just when he believes he has reached the citadel he seeks to conquer undisturbed. What is surprising, however, is that there is no one to sound the alarm. The reaction of the deep state to those who denounce its plan is broken and incoherent, but understandable. Just when the complicity of the mainstream media had succeeded in making the transition to the New World Order almost painless and unnoticed, all sorts of deceptions, scandals and crimes are coming to light. Until a few months ago, it was easy to smear as “conspiracy theorists” those who denounced these terrible plans, which we now see being carried out down to the smallest detail. No one, up until last February, would ever have thought that, in all of our cities, citizens would be arrested simply for wanting to walk down the street, to breathe, to want to keep their business open, to want to go to church on Sunday. Yet now it is happening all over the world, even in picture-postcard Italy that many Americans consider to be a small enchanted country, with its ancient monuments, its churches, its charming cities, its characteristic villages. And while the politicians are barricaded inside their palaces promulgating decrees like Persian satraps, businesses are failing, shops are closing, and people are prevented from living, traveling, working, and praying. The disastrous psychological consequences of this operation are already being seen, beginning with the suicides of desperate entrepreneurs and of our children, segregated from friends and classmates, told to follow their classes while sitting at home alone in front of a computer. In Sacred Scripture, Saint Paul speaks to us of “the one who opposes” the manifestation of the mystery of iniquity, the kathèkon (2 Thess 2:6-7). In the religious sphere, this obstacle to evil is the Church, and in particular the papacy; in the political sphere, it is those who impede the establishment of the New World Order. As is now clear, the one who occupies the Chair of Peter has betrayed his role from the very beginning in order to defend and promote the globalist ideology, supporting the agenda of the deep church, who chose him from its ranks. Mr. President, you have clearly stated that you want to defend the nation – One Nation under God, fundamental liberties, and non-negotiable values that are denied and fought against today. It is you, dear President, who are “the one who opposes” the deep state, the final assault of the children of darkness. For this reason, it is necessary that all people of good will be persuaded of the epochal importance of the imminent election: not so much for the sake of this or that political program, but because of the general inspiration of your action that best embodies – in this particular historical context – that world, our world, which they want to cancel by means of the lockdown. Your adversary is also our adversary: it is the Enemy of the human race, He who is “a murderer from the beginning” (Jn 8:44). Top of Form Bottom of Form Top of Form Bottom of Form Around you are gathered with faith and courage those who consider you the final garrison against the world dictatorship. The alternative is to vote for a person who is manipulated by the deep state, gravely compromised by scandals and corruption, who will do to the United States what Jorge Mario Bergoglio is doing to the Church, Prime Minister Conte to Italy, President Macron to France, Prime Minster Sanchez to Spain, and so on. The blackmailable nature of Joe Biden – just like that of the prelates of the Vatican’s “magic circle” – will expose him to be used unscrupulously, allowing illegitimate powers to interfere in both domestic politics as well as international balances. It is obvious that those who manipulate him already have someone worse than him ready, with whom they will replace him as soon as the opportunity arises. And yet, in the midst of this bleak picture, this apparently unstoppable advance of the “Invisible Enemy,” an element of hope emerges. The adversary does not know how to love, and it does not understand that it is not enough to assure a universal income or to cancel mortgages in order to subjugate the masses and convince them to be branded like cattle. This people, which for too long has endured the abuses of a hateful and tyrannical power, is rediscovering that it has a soul; it is understanding that it is not willing to exchange its freedom for the homogenization and cancellation of its identity; it is beginning to understand the value of familial and social ties, of the bonds of faith and culture that unite honest people. This Great Reset is destined to fail because those who planned it do not understand that there are still people ready to take to the streets to defend their rights, to protect their loved ones, to give a future to their children and grandchildren. The leveling inhumanity of the globalist project will shatter miserably in the face of the firm and courageous opposition of the children of Light. The enemy has Satan on its side, He who only knows how to hate. But on our side, we have the Lord Almighty, the God of armies arrayed for battle, and the Most Holy Virgin, who will crush the head of the ancient Serpent. “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Rom 8:31). Mr. President, you are well aware that, in this crucial hour, the United States of America is considered the defending wall against which the war declared by the advocates of globalism has been unleashed. Place your trust in the Lord, strengthened by the words of the Apostle Paul: “I can do all things in Him who strengthens me” (Phil 4:13). To be an instrument of Divine Providence is a great responsibility, for which you will certainly receive all the graces of state that you need, since they are being fervently implored for you by the many people who support you with their prayers. With this heavenly hope and the assurance of my prayer for you, for the First Lady, and for your collaborators, with all my heart I send you my blessing. God bless the United States of America! + Carlo Maria Viganò Tit. Archbishop of Ulpiana Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America"
Terror Attack In Austria: Killer Was Convicted Sympathizer Released “Early”,3 NOV 2020,7055,"The enemy knows who his enemy is. On Monday, a gang of armed terrorists killed four people near a Jewish Synagogue in Austria. One of the men involved was a previously convicted criminal who was released early because of his “juvenile” status. Zero Hedge reported: Now that the dust has cleared, police in Vienna have finally had some time to piece together more details from Monday’s brutal attack in the Central European city. Vienna is a European cultural powerhouse, but it has seen far fewer terror attacks over the last 20 years than many of its neighbors. But on Monday night, a gang of assailants struck at six areas in downtown Vienna, attacking pedestrians and police. Overnight, the number killed in the attack swelled to 5, 4 victims, and 1 assailant, while 17 others were wounded in the shooting. The dead attacker was identified as a 20-year-old Austrian-North Macedonian dual national who had one prior terror conviction. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer confirmed that the prior conviction was for membership in a terrorist organization. The attacker who was killed, whose name was Kujtim Fejzulai, was sentenced to 22 months in prison in April 2019 because he had tried to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State, though he was granted early release under juvenile law. At least one other attacker is believed to be on the run, Nehammer said. The terrorist who was shot in killed was wearing what authorities initially believed to be an explosive vest, though it “turned out to be a dummy”. His apartment was raided in the night, authorities said. Though there were reports on Monday about a gang of attackers striking at six separate locations, it’s currently unclear exactly how many participated in last night’s attack. The FT and AP reported that it isn’t clear whether Fejzulai, a known ISIS member, was acting alone. The victims included two men and two women. 7 others are in life-threatening condition from gunshot wounds and cuts. During comments made early Tuesday morning in Vienna, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz affirmed that the incident was “clearly an Islamic terror attack.” “It was an attack out of hatred for our fundamental values, hatred for our way of life, hatred for our democracy in which all people have equal rights and dignity.” Authorities still couldn’t say whether more attackers might be on the run. Workers were asked to stay home if possible on Tuesday, and children were dismissed from school until further notice. The city’s public transit was closed. Some 1,000 officers were on duty to help with the investigation while the army was brought in to guard soft targets across the city. The shooting started at around 2000 local time as people headed downtown to enjoy one last drink before new coronavirus lockdown measures came into effect. The assailant who was killed was shot at around 2010, according to Vienna police chief Gerhard Puerstl. Kurz’s government ordered three days of official mourning, with flags to be flown at half-mast. A minute of silence was held at noon on Tuesday. Thousands of videos purporting to show the incident were uploaded to social media last night, authorities said, including the video below, purporting to show the moment a terrorist was captured. #viyana #Vienna #ViennaAttack Moment of capture of terrorists. pic.twitter.com/aPLkQ96KNV — Zengin Global (@zenginglobal) November 3, 2020 The video below was among the earliest to hit social media after news of the attacks broke.

President Emmanuel Macron publicly defended the right for secularists to publish cartoons featuring the prophet Mohammad. Several Muslim world leaders have attacked Macron for his defense of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. A class on freedom of expression featuring the cartoons allegedly motivated a young Islamic extremist to murder French teacher Samuel Paty. Leaders from around the world offered their condolences to Austria, and condemned all violence tied to radical Islamist extremists. The New York Post added: The dead attacker who killed four people and wounded 17 others in Vienna was described Tuesday as a 20-year-old ISIS sympathizer with dual Austrian-North Macedonian citizenship who had a previous terror conviction, according to reports. Two men and two women were “killed in cold blood” Monday night, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said during a televised speech in which he announced a nationwide minute of silence in memory of the victims, CNN reported. “It is now confirmed that yesterday’s attack was clearly an Islamist terror attack,” Kurz said. “It was an attack out of hatred — hatred for our fundamental values, hatred for our way of life, hatred for our democracy in which all people have equal rights and dignity.” The assailant — identified as Kujtim Fejzulai — was sentenced to 22 months in prison in April 2019 because he had tried to travel to Syria to join ISIS. He was granted early release in December under juvenile law. He “was equipped with a fake explosive vest and an automatic rifle, a handgun and a machete to carry out this repugnant attack on innocent citizens,” Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told Austrian news agency APA. Fifteen houses have been searched and several people have been arrested, Nehammer said. Authorities were still trying to determine whether additional attackers may be on the run as residents in the capital were urged to stay at home if possible on Tuesday. Health officials said seven people among the 17 injured were in life-threatening condition Tuesday. One of those wounded is a 28-year-old police officer who is expected to survive, Nehammer said. The shooting began about 8 p.m. Monday near the city’s main synagogue as many people were enjoying a last night of open restaurants and bars before a month-long coronavirus lockdown, which started at midnight. Police chief Gerhard Puerstl said the assailant was killed at 8:09 p.m. Video posted on social media showed a man walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random. It was unclear whether the man seen shooting was the same person in each video. Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars near the synagogue. “They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said. “All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown.” President Trump tweeted Monday night as he prepared for his final rally before Election Day: “Our prayers are with the people of Vienna after yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe.” “These evil attacks against innocent people must stop,” he added. “The U.S. stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.”"
"Michigan Gov. Now Demands Bars/Restaurants Require Names, Phone Numbers Of Customers",2 NOV 2020,4268,"In Michigan, keeping COVID outbreaks at the forefront of the ‘narrative’ is getting harder as more and more people recognize that the virus is designed to control, nothing else. So, the leftists in charge have developed a new scheme. Unlike Sweden, where lockdowns were never conducted, and COVID is effectively wiped out, Michigan is determined to prolong shut downs, which prolong the outbreak. Now, they are requiring bars and restaurants to collect the names and phone numbers of customers. The Daily Wire reported: Michigan officials claim there have been 12 coronavirus outbreaks stemming from bars and restaurants, so now the state wants patrons to provide their name and phone number for future potential contact tracing. The new rule from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services will go into effect on Monday, Fox News reported. Bars and restaurants will also be required to restrict the number of customers to 50 or fewer and allow no more than six people at a single table. Bars and restaurants that don’t follow the new mandate could be fined $1,000. Scott Ellis, executive director of the Michigan Licensed Beverage Association, told Fox 17 that the state already requires restaurants to operate at 50% capacity. Further, he said, wait staff are having to deal with customers who don’t appreciate the restrictions. “Our frontline servers have already had trouble dealing with masks and mandates and mandating masks,” Ellis told the outlet. “We did de-escalation training and all kinds of other things to help with that and now we’re taking to the next level. We have to gather someone’s personal information?” “We just told them ‘look get names and phone numbers and write it on a piece of paper’ because if the health department calls you and says, ‘hey someone came in on this date I need the list’ they have to provide it,” he added. If customers refuse to provide their names and phone numbers, Fox 17 reported, they may be refused service. “You accept it when you’re ordering out it’s just something you have to do and then how many people don’t want to give it when they order out and how truthful is it? We don’t know,” Ellis told the outlet. “And I think when you’re going to sit down at a restaurant you just don’t expect someone to take your name and number because you’re coming to have a drink or a burger.” Justin Winslow, president and CEO of the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association, told Fox 17 in a statement in a statement that this new mandated doesn’t match “existing science and data” showing “minimal transmission” from restaurants. He said that about 2% of cases currently being investigated by Michigan are from bars and restaurants. Michigan health officials say that number is now 5.5%. Winslow’s full statement: We appreciate and respect the efforts of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to keep all Michiganders safe as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Michigan. We maintain, however, that a restaurant industry-specific contact tracing mandate lacks merit given existing science and data. The COVID-19 outbreak investigation data collected by the MDHHS continues to show minimal transmission from restaurant dining, despite the rising caseloads, representing only about 2% of all cases the state is investigating. In relation to the size and scope of the industry, which serves millions of people every day and employs several hundred thousand more, this well-intended effort is more likely to result in job loss, foreclosure and fewer restaurants than it will prevent transmission. Restaurants across this state have risen to the challenge thrust upon them in 2020, providing a place for people to safely gather, eat a great meal and feel, well, human. We remain confident that if given the opportunity, restaurants will continue to offer this experience in a safer environment than alternatives that are less regulated and less sanitized. Robert Gordon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, however, said the new mandate was enacted to take “targeted action” to parts of the economy that are “particularly severe sources of spread.” “We are issuing guidance that is a very clear road map for what we need to do bring cases down,” he told The Detroit News."
Boom! Trump Celebrates “Record Economic Growth” As GDP Numbers Stun,30 OCT 2020,3053,"For those hate-filled liberals who hoped that COVID would destroy President Trump’s booming economy, they’ve just been given another dose of reality by a boss! A massive increase in growth domestic product demonstrates the difference between a president who uses his position to work for the people… as opposed to one who would sell his soul to America’s enemies in order to enrich his own family. Townhall reported: The Trump campaign is celebrating a massive 33.1 percent increase in growth domestic product for the third quarter and warning former Vice President Joe Biden will put a halt to economic progress. “This record economic growth is absolute validation of President Trump’s policies which create jobs and opportunities for Americans in every corner of the country. The President built the world’s best economy once and he’s rapidly doing it again, proving that cutting taxes and reducing regulations and red tape clear the way for American ingenuity and our entrepreneurial spirit to thrive. We have regained more than half of the jobs lost to the global pandemic in less than six months, while it took more than two years to regain half of job losses from a recession while Joe Biden was in charge,”  Trump 2020 Communications Director Tim Murtaugh released in a statement. “President Trump will continue to safely reopen the country, while Biden is the candidate of lockdowns, inviting another economic shutdown which would devastate working people and cause even more health problems above and beyond what the coronavirus has caused.” GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all.

"“Who The He*l Elected You?” Dorsey Admits There’s No Evidence Post Story Is False, Account Closed",29 OCT 2020,9441,"Imagine the phone company had the power to shut down your service simply because of the opinion you expressed to your friends and family. That’s what Twitter, Facebook and a host of other leftist controlled ‘social media’ platforms are able to do, and have done for years. But finally, the Senate is investigating. The New York Post, the historical news publication who broke the story of Hunter Biden’s laptop, still has its account suspended, and yesterday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that his company runs a blackmail operation… either comply with his views, or no traffic. A fiery Ted Cruz blasted the propaganda machines that get the same protections as phone companies. The New York Post reported: For all their talk of “neutral platforms,” the Big Shots at Big Tech — Twitter, Facebook and Google — are running a protection racket. They figure they can dictate what Americans get to see and read, and what other media companies must do to reach the public via those platforms. It’s a clear threat to a healthy democracy — and Congress has noticed. On Wednesday, the Senate launched a hearing to investigate “Big Tech’s bad behavior.” Center-stage: Twitter’s strong-arm tactics to censor The Post ever since we began reporting on Hunter Biden’s e-mails. First, it froze our account and banned our stories; then, amid a public backlash, it agreed to unfreeze us — but only if we deleted our original tweets. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sounded like every mob enforcer and shakedown artist in history: Nice paper you got there, New York Post. Shame, should something happen to it. He knows full well media outlets depend on social media, and Google search algorithms, to help readers access our reporting. Sen. Ted Cruz wasn’t fooled: “Mr. Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report, and what the American people are allowed to hear?” he thundered. “Why do you persist in behaving as a Democratic super PAC, silencing views to the contrary of your political beliefs?” Dorsey tried to claim it was all a mistake that had been fixed, but The Post account remained locked, even as he spoke. “Can the New York Post post on their Twitter account?” Cruz asked. “If they go into their account . . . ” squirmed Dorsey, before Cruz cut him off. “No, is your answer to that,” fumed Cruz, “unless they genuflect and agree with your dictates.” Besides, if it was an honest error, then why do they only happen to one side? As Sen. Marsha Blackburn noted, Twitter has “censored” President Trump 65 times and Joe Biden zero. “There is a pattern of subjective manipulation of information.” Nor can Twitter and Facebook, which also moved to suppress The Post’s reporting, claim there’s anything wrong with the stories. Asked if they had any “evidence” of that, Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg both admitted they didn’t. Some folks think the paper should’ve just caved immediately and deleted the story. Yet the problem isn’t The Post’s failure to squelch stories — it’s Big Tech’s heavy-handed shakedown. The Epoch Times explored the testimony in detail: Senators grilled the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook, and Google over alleged anti-conservative biases on their platforms during a hearing on their moderation practices. It comes amid a cloud of growing bipartisan antitrust scrutiny and concerns over the censorship of a New York Post report. The Oct. 28 Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing, titled “Does Section 230’s Sweeping Immunity Enable Big Tech Bad Behavior?” quickly turned into a battle of opposing arguments. Democrats asserted that the hearing was organized for political reasons, pointing to the timing of the election less than a week away, with some such as Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) calling the session “bullying” and “nonsense.” Republicans, meanwhile, accused the companies themselves of interfering in the election. In opening statements, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Alphabet Inc. [Google’s parent company] CEO Sundar Pichai, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to make the argument that stripping Section 230 media law protections would stifle free speech, and called for alternative regulatory solutions. They largely agreed that more transparency over their content moderation practices is needed. At one point, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) asked Dorsey about Twitter’s censorship of the New York Post’s Oct. 14 reporting on Hunter Biden. “Mr. Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?” he said. “We are not doing that,” Dorsey replied. “This is why I opened this hearing for calls for more transparency. … We hear the concerns.” Dorsey conceded that the blocking of the Post’s URL on Twitter was wrong. “We recognized an error in policy, we changed it in 24 hours,” he said, noting that anyone can share the link to the article now. At the time, Twitter claimed the Post article violated its “Hacked Materials Policy,” before changing the policy following widespread backlash. The Post’s Twitter account could be unlocked if it deletes its original tweet, Dorsey said, adding that the newspaper would then be allowed to repost and share the link freely. In a follow-up after his questioning, Cruz claimed that he tried to share the Post’s story on Twitter but couldn’t. An hour later, Cruz said the article could be shared. The crux of the issue is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Publishers can be held liable for any content they post, while social media platforms are protected by Section 230, which states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Critics say these companies, which claim to be platforms, aren’t only maintaining a public forum but are also moderating the content, effectively making them publishers. Cruz told The Epoch Times last week that Big Tech CEOs “are acting as Democrats’ willing henchmen, and they have more power than William Randolph Hearst, at the height of yellow journalism, could have only imagined.” During the hearing, all three CEOs (who testified virtually) agreed the companies should be held liable if the platforms act as publishers. Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said in his opening statement that he’s concerned these platforms have “become powerful arbiters of what is true and what content users can access.” He rejected the notion that any criticism was due to partisan politics. “Although some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have characterized this as a purely partisan exercise, there is strong bipartisan support for reviewing Section 230,” Wicker said. “In fact, both presidential candidates, Trump and Biden, have proposed repealing Section 230 in its entirety—a position I have not yet embraced.” Wicker, like other Republican senators during the hearing, brought up the censorship of the New York Post article on Hunter Biden. He criticized what he called a double standard, pointing out that a New York Times story on the president’s illegally leaked tax returns wasn’t censored, and the now-discredited Steele dossier was widely shared without fact-checking or disclaimers. “This apparent double standard would be appalling under normal circumstances,” he said. “But the fact that selective censorship is occurring in the midst of the 2020 election cycle dramatically amplifies the power wielded by Facebook and Twitter.” It’s not just politicians who worry about censorship on social media platforms. Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults say it is “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that social media sites “intentionally censor political viewpoints that they find objectionable,” according to an August survey by the Pew Research Center. While people across the political spectrum believe censorship is taking place, the belief is particularly strong among Republicans, the center said. During the hearing, Zuckerberg went further than some of the other CEOs over what to do about Section 230. He acknowledged at one point that Congress “should update the law to make sure it’s working as intended.” Dorsey and Pichai however warned that any changes could have major ramifications. “Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,” Dorsey said. Conservatives have long accused Big Tech of censoring political speech, particularly that of those on the right. Democrats and Big Tech have repeatedly denied that such suppression exists. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai has said that his agency will move forward with President Donald Trump’s petition to clarify the meaning of the law. In an Oct. 15 statement, Pai said the “FCC has the legal authority to interpret Section 230,” adding that “members of all three branches of the federal government have expressed serious concerns” about the interpretation of Section 230. Trump has also floated the idea of completely repealing Section 230 protections. “If Big Tech persists, in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protections,” he said in an Oct. 15 Twitter post. “When government granted these protections, they created a monster!”"
"Democrats Seethe After Vote, Threaten Revenge Against Country",27 OCT 2020,3928,"After Amy Coney Barrett became the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, democrats took to the airwaves to threaten republican lawmakers, and consequently, the people who voted them in office. Fox News reported: “The Republican majority is lighting its credibility on fire … The next time the American people give Democrats a majority in this chamber, you will have forfeited the right to tell us how to run that majority,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a floor speech Monday. [Fortunately, many agree that such a contingency is unlikely, given recent democrat losses.] “My colleagues may regret this for a lot longer than they think,” he added. Nominees once needed 60 votes to be confirmed, but Sen. Mitch McConnell changed the standard in 2017 to allow for a simple majority. That move allowed for the confirmation of President Trump’s previous two nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., first eliminated the 60-vote threshold in 2013 to overcome GOP stonewalling of President Obama’s nominations to the lower courts and the executive branch. Known as invoking the “nuclear option” at the time, Reid kept the higher standard in place for the Supreme Court. The comments by Schumer appeared to be similar to those made by McConnell back in 2013 after the Democratic-controlled chamber eliminated the 60-vote threshold. “You’ll regret this, and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,” McConnell said in 2013, according to the Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also released a statement criticizing Trump and the GOP Senate for “committed an act of supreme desperation” so close to Election Day. Pelosi argued the confirmation, which she called a manipulation, was made so Trump and Republicans could “achieve their years-long campaign to destroy Americans’ health care” “The President’s Supreme Court manipulation threatens the very values and rights that define and distinguish our nation: a woman’s constitutional right to make her own medical decisions, the rights of LGBTQ Americans, the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain for fair wages, the future of our planet and environmental protections, voting rights and the right of every American to have a voice in our democracy,” Pelosi wrote in a statement. Democratic senators warned that Republicans have lost the right to complain if they win back the majority. “Will Democrats go to new, extraordinary lengths to maximize their power given the extraordinary lengths Republicans have gone to maximize their power? This is not a conversation that is ripe enough yet, but what do Republicans expect?” said Sen. Chris Murphy D-Conn., as part of the chamber’s debate over Barrett. “Do we just unilaterally stand down and not choose to use the same tools that Republicans did in the majority? … I think there are now new rules in the Senate, and I think Republicans have set them,” he continued, according to the paper. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., released a statement calling the confirmation a “sad day for the Senate and for the Court.” “My Republican colleagues put the rule of ‘because we can’ over the traditions and precedents of the Senate, the principles we hold dear as an institution, and the integrity of the federal judiciary,” he said. The Supreme Court said in a press release Monday that Barrett will be able to start her new role after Chief Justice John Roberts administers her judicial oath on Tuesday. Justice Clarence Thomas administered the constitutional oath at Monday’s ceremony.

COVID Politics: Journals ‘Reject’ Massive Scientific Mask Study Proving Ineffectiveness,26 OCT 2020,7697,"Many people have argued—citing over 20 studies about masks’ ineffective ability to stop the spread of respiratory viruses—that the COVID ‘mask’ mandates are arbitrary and based on lies. It seems that they are correct. Now, Journals are ‘rejecting’ a scientific study that proves the idiocy of wearing a mask to protect against coronavirus. Just The News reported: A major study out of Denmark that sought to examine the efficacy of face masks at limiting the spread of COVID-19 has reportedly been rejected by multiple academic journals amid hints that the study found face coverings are not effective in protecting individuals from the coronavirus. Masks have been among the most persistent and controversial flashpoints of the COVID-19 epidemic for months. Health officials around the world initially argued strongly against their use, claiming that studies over the years had demonstrated that masks were ineffective at stopping respiratory viruses and unnecessary for the current pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in March: “Right now, in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.” Growing concerns over a purportedly high rate of asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 led many of those same officials, including Fauci, to reverse their recommendations, urging people to wear masks whenever they go out in public. Reflecting the new public sentiment on masks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges Americans to “wear masks in public settings, like on public and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people.” Mandates by governors and national leaders over the past several months have further enforced those conclusions, with many public leaders issuing orders for citizens to don face coverings while in grocery stores, on public transport, and even in open outdoor areas such as public parks. Danish study has reportedly been ready for months In spite of their now-ubiquitous presence in most of the Western world today, relatively little evidence exists to support widespread use of face-masking to prevent the spread of respiratory disease. A 2019 World Health Organization review of pandemic mitigation measures, for instance, found “no evidence” that face coverings helped to stop the spread of influenza. Whether or not studies on influenza transmission can apply to COVID-19 is unknown; the disease’s relatively recent emergence means that scientific studies on it are in short supply. Studies can take many month to secure funding, develop methodologies, carry out experiments, interpret the findings, write a research paper and get it peer-reviewed and published. To bridge that gap, a team of Danish scientists earlier this year sought to carry out a major randomized controlled trial study to determine how effective masks might be at stopping COVID transmission. The study, begun in April, involved around 6,000 Danish citizens, half of whom wore face coverings during “normal behavior” and the other half of whom went without them. The study concluded in June. Yet the Copenhagen newspaper Berlingske reported this week that it has been rejected by at least three elite medical journals so far — the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, and JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. “They all said no,” Christian Torp-Pederson, one of the study’s researchers, told the Danish newspaper this week. He added that the study’s scientists “cannot start discussing what [the journals] are dissatisfied with, because in that case we must also explain what the study showed, and we do not want to discuss that until it is published.” Study will be published ‘as soon as a journal is brave enough’ The paper’s lack of publication thus far is not, on its face, unheard of. Peer review — the process by which independent experts analyze, criticize and edit scientific papers prior to publication in official journals — can take several months or more from start to finish. Yet there have been indications that the study may be ruffling feathers among medical officials and researchers, with some of the study’s directors suggesting, cryptically, that its results may run against the grain of current public orthodoxy on mask usage. Responding to a query last week about when the study will be published, one of its researchers — University of Copenhagen infectious disease Professor Thomas Benfield — replied: “As soon as a journal is brave enough to accept the paper.” Benfield in a later interview with Berlingske warned against taking that quote “out of context,” stating: “The article is being reviewed by a respected journal.” Benfield confirmed to Just the News that the study “is going through peer review,” and he called the process “not unusual.” Another one of the study’s authors, Christian Torp-Pedersen, told the Copenhagen newspaper that he “might also have dared to go as far as Benfield” regarding Benfield’s response. Asked by the paper if the study’s results could be considered “controversial,” he said: “That’s how I want to interpret it.” Questioned by the paper further on whether or not the study might demonstrate “no significant effect of mask use,” he replied: “I think that’s a very relevant question you are asking.” Another one of the study’s authors, Henrik Ullum, wrote on Twitter this week that the study’s researchers are “very unhappy about the delay of our study.” “We never anticipated this delay,” he continued, adding: “The peer review process is important to secure correct scientific conclusions for this sensitive research question.” Supporters say masks can save tens of thousands of lives Neither Torp-Pedersen nor Ullum responded to queries from Just the News about the study and its delay. None of the three journals that allegedly rejected it, meanwhile, were willing to comment on the matter either. Lancet spokeswoman Jessica Kleyn told Just the News that the journal “does not comment on papers it has not published.” NEJM spokeswoman Julia Morin responded that the journal’s publication process “is confidential, and we cannot confirm or deny anything about any manuscripts not published in NEJM.” JAMA did not respond to queries. Last month, several academics out of Harvard, Stanford and George Washington University published a letter critical of the Danish study’s methodology. Providing what might be interpreted as further evidence that the study’s results challenge the efficacy of masking, these critics argued that inherent design flaws in the study — including possible noncompliance factors within both the control and study groups — could unfairly skew the results in favor of non-mask usage. The study “poses a serious risk of mistranslation” due to concerns that “null or too-small effects will be misinterpreted to mean that masks are ineffective,” the writers stated. The academics warned policy-makers against “interpreting the results of this trial as being anything other than artifacts of weak design.” Proponents of masks have argued that widespread usage of face coverings will significantly reduce COVID-19 caseloads and death tolls. The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said in a paper published this week that “universal mask use” could prevent an additional 129,574 deaths throughout the United States by February. Conversely, numerous countries across the world that have mandated the use of face masks in public have recently seen infection rates soar. Both Germany and Spain, for instance, have had mask mandates in place for months, yet both countries have seen recent sharp resurgences in new COVID-19 cases over the last several weeks."
Post Buries Facts About Vaccine Volunteer Who Died,23 OCT 2020,4448,"The Washington Post tweeted that a vaccine trial “volunteer” had died… but after closer scrutiny, it seems that WaPo was deliberately trying to scare people. The person who perished was NOT given the trial vaccine. The Federalist reported: Volunteer in Oxford coronavirus vaccine trial dies https://t.co/xsp0iTPX4T — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 21, 2020 While the Twitter caption for the article is jarring and reads as a major cause for concern, once clicked on, the full headline reveals that this abbreviated spin is misleading. “Volunteer in Oxford coronavirus vaccine trial dies, reportedly did not receive experimental vaccine,” the headline on the WaPo website reads. The article goes on to note that the volunteer referred to in the tweet was reportedly in a control group in the trial that did not receive the vaccine. The Brazilian died after contracting COVID-19. This important fact, however, doesn’t appear in the article until the third paragraph. The first two paragraphs, including the hook for the story, purposefully avoid this key fact. “A Brazilian who participated in the clinical trial of an experimental coronavirus vaccine has died, officials here said Wednesday,” the article reads. “Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency, which is overseeing multiple vaccine trials in a country suffering one of the world’s worst outbreaks, said the individual volunteered to receive the vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and produced by AstraZeneca,” it continues. Many Twitter users noted that this spin by the Post is misleading to readers, irresponsible, and injured the integrity of the story. Wouldn’t be the worst to have this info all in the tweet copy to avoid scaring people unnecessarily about vaccines. https://t.co/vyei2dhdQD pic.twitter.com/316WjgQrqP — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) October 21, 2020 Responsible journalism would have pointed out in the headline (or at least the tweet) that the volunteer had been given a placebo https://t.co/E2ducKQSgv — David Cochrane (@davidcochrane) October 22, 2020 Very irresponsible that this tweet omits the fact that the volunteer was reportedly *in the control group* https://t.co/x9BCNfD4GE — Gregg Carlstrom (@glcarlstrom) October 22, 2020 *who was in a control group and didn’t receive the vaccine Pretty staggering how irresponsible this is. https://t.co/rzIKTws30F — Ben Thompson (@benthompson) October 22, 2020 Pretty irresponsible to not include this in the tweet: “…the volunteer was in a control group that did not receive the experimental vaccine and died of covid-19.” https://t.co/a6BEQFbqqM — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 22, 2020 Misleading headline with an intention to spread despair.

Maybe mention that? https://t.co/V2sKaAeC9T — Tim Fullerton (@TimFullerton) October 21, 2020 This anti-vaccine spin has been a popular talking point among media outlets and Democrats. On Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged Americans to be “skeptical” of a vaccine manufactured and approved under the Trump Administration. “You are going to say to the American people, now, here’s a vaccine, it is new, it was done quickly, but trust this federal administration and their health administration that it’s safe? And we’re not 100% sure of the consequences? I think it’s going to be a very skeptical American public about taking the vaccine and it should be.” Democratic VP Nominee Kamala Harris also cast suspicion over a vaccine produced by the Trump administration during the vice presidential debate, saying she doesn’t trust the president enough to get the vaccine herself. “If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely,” Harris said. “If Donald Trump tells us to take it, I’m not taking it.” A poll released by STAT-Harris shows that American willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine is falling after these pushes by Democrats and their corporate media echo chambers have expressed skepticism of its safety and urged Americans to avoid it if approved. According to the poll, 69 percent of the U.S. public said they would get the COVID-19 vaccine “as soon as a vaccine was available” in mid-August, but only 58 percent said the same thing in October."
Trump Releases Full CBS ‘Interview’: Stahl Whines President “Insulted” 60 Minutes,23 OCT 2020,7017,"Apparently, allowing the American people to hear unedited words spoken by the president and vice president during an interview is an “insult” to a leftist reporter and 60 Minutes, who carefully crafted what they wanted viewers to hear. How dare President Trump expose such bias? Lesley Stahl is livid after President Trump released the unedited (aka true) interview. Conservative Treehouse reported: Earlier today President Trump preempted the CBS election hit job carried out by Lesley Stahl by putting raw footage of the interview on Facebook. [SEE HERE] Additionally, the White House showed the “bias, hatred” and agenda within the interview by publishing the interview with Vice President Mike Pence [SEE HERE] It is obvious by the tone, interruptions, disrespect and rude confrontational style of the interview, CBS had an agenda to create an election narrative with the interview.  President Trump shares the raw footage so that American voters can see the attempt to engineer a very familiar media narrative. [Trump interview HERE] – [Pence interview HERE] It should be remembered that CBS intentionally interfered with the 2012 election when they withheld an interview with President Obama, and edited out the transcript, admitting the attack on Benghazi was an act of terrorism. Fox News reported: President Trump followed through after tweeting that he will publish an “unedited preview” of his “60 Minutes” sitdown to show viewers that the interview was a “vicious attempted ‘takeout’” by correspondent Lesley Stahl when he posted a portion of the interview on Facebook Thursday. “I will soon be giving a first in television history full, unedited preview of the vicious attempted ‘takeout’ interview of me by Lesley Stahl of @60Minutes,” Trump wrote. “Watch her constant interruptions & anger. Compare my full, flowing and ‘magnificently brilliant’ answers to their ‘Q’s.’” “60 Minutes” did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A few hours later, Trump’s Facebook page released the footage. In a preview released by CBS, Trump and Stahl disagreed over the state of the economy prior to the coronavirus pandemic. “We created the greatest economy in the history of our country,” the president said before Stahl chimed in, “You know that’s not true.” Trump was also shown saying China is our biggest foreign adversary. “They’re a competitor. They’re a foe in many ways, but they’re an adversary, I think what happened was disgraceful, should never have happened. They should never have allowed this plague to get out of China and go throughout the world,” Trump said. “60 Minutes” noted in its tweet that the show “has a history of asking tough questions of presidential candidates during the runup to the election,” and Sunday’s episode will also feature an interview with Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Sources told Fox News that Stahl was “extremely hostile” and that she began the interview along the lines of “get ready for some tough questions.” Earlier this week, Trump lashed out at Stahl for not wearing a mask at the White House following the interview. “Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come,” the president teased. The tweet was presumed to be a reference to the ongoing criticism the Trump administration receives from members of the media for not strictly following CDC guidelines that urge mask-wearing and social-distancing. President Trump has ratcheted up his attacks against the media in recent weeks between the lack of coverage the explosive Hunter Biden story has been getting and the controversy surrounding suspended C-SPAN host Steve Scully, who was supposed to moderate the canceled second presidential debate, for lying about his Twitter account being hacked after reaching out to Trump foe Anthony Scaramucci. He has repeatedly slammed NBC News correspondent and third debate moderator, Kristen Welker, ahead of Thursday’s political showdown. Stahl complained violently about the move. Fox News reported: Lesley Stahl of CBS News told Vice President Mike Pence during a “60 Minutes” interview this week that she felt he and President Trump had “insulted” her — as well as the news program. The long-time correspondent accused both men of answering her questions with “set campaign speeches” rather than in-the-moment remarks, according to video that was preemptively released by the White House on Thursday. “Mr. Vice President, this was not a rally. This was not just a campaign speech to the public. This was supposed to be an interview,” Stahl told Pence in a video posted to Facebook in its entirety by Trump. “And the same with the president. And I feel that you both have insulted ’60 Minutes’ and me by not answering our questions and by giving set campaign speeches that we’ve heard both of you give at rallies without answering our questions,” she added. “Lesley, what question haven’t I answered? What questioned haven’t I answered right now?” Pence responded. Stahl cited a question on whether Pence had any comment on President Trump’s previous remarks directed toward Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. “There is this kind of anticipation that people in power are held accountable and that they answer questions from the public — not from me, from the public. And I feel that you didn’t do that, and I’m upset,” Stahl told Pence. “Well, Lesley, I appreciate the speech that you just gave but I answered all your questions, and I’ve spoken about things the American people care about,” Pence said. “The American people want a president who will put the health of America first and open up America’s economy.” “Look at what you’re doing right now, you’re giving a speech,” Stahl responded. Her interview with Pence took place after Trump cut short his earlier heated conversation with Stahl after sparring over a number of issues ranging from his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, social justice issues, and supposed anti-media bias. Both interviews were released after the president went through with his threat to post an unedited version of the conversation in the hours leading up to the final presidential debate Thursday night in Nashville, Tenn. The interview was reportedly supposed to be a joint appearance. The president urged viewers to “look at the bias, hatred, and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS,” under the first 37-minute video posted to his Facebook page. Trump also cited “more bias, hatred, and rudeness on 60 Minutes with our Great Vice President” in the caption of the second roughly 14-minute long video he released of the Pence interview. CBS News on Thursday issued its own statement about the premature release of the footage, condemning, “The White House’s unprecedented decision to disregard their agreement with CBS News and release their footage.” It added that the uncut video “will not deter 60 MINUTES from providing its full, fair, and contextual reporting which presidents have participated in for decades.”"
"Evidence Shows Houston Judge, Election Staff Cheating In Election Right Now",23 OCT 2020,15912,"A retired police officer and Texas poll watcher has sworn in an affidavit that he personally witnessed an election judge and staff members cheating in the 2020 election… and he has the evidence to prove it. In an exclusive report published by the National file, the contents of the document were released, showing that in Texas, democrats are actively committing voter fraud… right now: Texas poll watcher Raymond T. Stewart, a retired police officer, submitted a sworn affidavit Thursday that was provided to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office. That affidavit, exclusively obtained by NATIONAL FILE, alleges that a Houston precinct judge and staff illegally used a stack of driver’s licenses in their possession to allow people to vote illegally in the 2020 election at a drive-through voting window created by the Coronavirus pandemic. Stewart’s affidavit and photos of the scheme are presented below. The acting precinct judge’s identity has been confirmed by the Harris County Clerk’s Office and insiders identify her as a Democrat. Harris County, where Houston is located, is also the site where the Joe Biden campaign’s Texas political director Dallas Jones is accused of running an illegal ballot harvesting operation, according to two separate affidavits submitted to the Texas Supreme Court by former law enforcement officials. Here is the GoFundMe page for private investigators who are busting what insiders say is one of the largest voter fraud rings in the United States. Here is a photo from the scene of the stack of driver’s licenses. Here Is The Sworn Affidavit, Under Oath, of Raymond T. Stewart: “My name is Raymond T. Stewart. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct. “I am a 30+ year veteran Texas Peace Officer. I am a volunteer poll watcher for Candidate Andre Hines. On 10/13/2020, at 8:40am, I arrived at polling location Northeast Multi-Services Center, PRCT ID SRD141C, 9720 Spaulding Street, Houston, Texas 77016.” “I informed the staff that I was a poll watcher for a candidate and had my paperwork. I asked for the precinct judge to sign my required paperwork so I could start work. The precinct judge is identified as April Elmore (Gibson) and she was there but refused to sign my paperwork and she instead directed me to someone inside named Madonna. Madonna signed the paperwork but not in the designated signature line. I then began my work as a poll watcher.” “I observed several oddities but the most concerning was a table in-between the sign-in tables One and Three. At that table was a large stack of Texas Driver’s Licenses. Staff would come inside from the drive-through voting booth and scan a driver’s license from someone outside and get a ticket and return outside. But sometimes a staff member would search through the stack of driver’s license on the table, then scan it, receive a ticket and also go outside to the drive-through booth. As a Police Officer, I quickly became suspicious that they were committing a crime by having the unattended D.L.’s just sitting on the table and that possible voting crimes were being committed using these forms of ID. Also during this time-frame an employee of the Harris County Attorney’s Office came by and he conversed with April but nothing changed and he departed. Since I was there as a poll watcher and not there as a Police Officer, I just continued to observe and considered how to deal with this situation. About that time a Precinct 1 Constable (Deputy W. Schultz) arrived at the polling location and he happened to be someone I knew professionally. I spoke with the Deputy outside and informed him of what
I had observed. He was amazed and asked for evidence which I provided to him.” “Unfortunately our conversation was overheard by a staff member in the parking lot. The Deputy went inside the polling location but at this time the driver’s licenses were removed and hidden from the table. The Deputy departed the area apparently to consult with the election taskforce and supervisors. A spoke with him several times that day via phone and in person regarding my observations. At 1:00pm April commanded me to leave the polling location because I had observed and collected evidence and she informed me that “I couldn’t.” “I have not received any call from any Federal, County nor State official investigating these serious actions and crimes.” NATIONAL FILE RECENTLY REPORTED: The Joe Biden campaign’s Texas Political Director has been formally accused of helping to run an illegal ballot harvesting operation, according to two separate affidavits filed Monday at the Texas Supreme Court. Two private investigators, including a former FBI agent and former police officer, testify under oath that they have video evidence, documentation and witnesses to prove that Biden’s Texas Political Director Dallas Jones and his cohorts are currently hoarding mail-in and absentee ballots and ordering operatives to fill the ballots out for people illegally, including for dead people, homeless people, and nursing home residents, in the 2020 presidential election. The affidavits were filed as part of the class-action lawsuit against Harris County and the state of Texas, filed by citizens, called Steven Hotze, M.D. et al. Journalist Patrick Howley of NATIONAL FILE has exclusively obtained this testimony and much more evidence will be coming out in the case. Dallas Jones was named the Biden campaign’s Texas Political Director in early September. HERE IS THE AFFIDAVIT OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND RETIRED HOUSTON POLICE OFFICER MARK A. AGUIRRE, SUBMITTED UNDER OATH. READ IT HERE: AFFIDAVIT OF MARK A. AGUIRRE “My name is Mark A. Aguirre. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct. “I am a retired captain with the Houston Police Department I am now a private investigator. “I am currently involved in an investigation related to a wide-ranging and fraudulent ballot harvesting scheme in Harris County intended to rig the elections in the Houston/Harris County area. This scheme involves voter fraud on a massive scale. “Based on interviews, review of documents, and other information, I have identified the individuals in charge of the ballot harvesting scheme. These individuals includes political consultant Dallas Jones who was recently hired by the Joe Biden for President campaign to oversee their Harris County initiative. District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles, who is the handler of Mr. Jones, political consultant Gerald Womack, and Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis. One of the companies these individuals are using as a front for this operation is AB Canvassing, although there are others that have been identified that we are investigating.” “I have in my possession video-taped interviews of witnesses attesting to the aforementioned people having groups of people completing thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots, including completing ballots for deceased individuals; illegally going into nursing homes, with the complicity of the nursing home staff, and filling out and forging the signatures of nursing home residents; signing up homeless individuals to vote using the ballot harvester’s address then completing the ballot and forging the homeless individual’s signature. “This entire operation is being run by the elite politicians of the Democrat Party in Houston/Harris County. FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT. HERE IS THE AFFIDAVIT OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND FORMER FBI AGENT CHARLES MARLER, SUBMITTED UNDER OATH. READ IT HERE: 2020-09-27_Charles F. Marler Affidavit:  “My name is Charles F. Marler. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.” “I formerly worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigations where I was an Investigative Specialist conducting undercover operations on espionage and terrorist targets. I am now a private investigator.” “In December of 2019, I was approached by two individuals who witnessed activity from an illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County. Since that date, I have been investigating the illegal ballot harvesting operation.” “During my investigation, a core group of names continued to surface regarding the organization and operation of the voter fraud scheme. Witnesses have stated to me that Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles are leading the illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas. Their chief lieutenants are Houston businessman Gerald Womack and political consultant Dallas Jones who work directly under them in executing the ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas.” “Witnesses have shown me and described to me how the ballot harvesters take absentee ballots from the elderly in nursing homes, from the homeless, and from unsuspecting residences’ mailboxes. The ballot harvesters then complete the ballots for their preferred candidate and forge the signature of the “voter”. Two witnesses stated to me that there are two individuals employed at the Harris County Clerk’s Office who are aware of the illegal ballots and help facilitate and mask the processing of the ballots into the legal stream of ballots.” “I have been made aware of a law enforcement investigation in the Spring of 2020 regarding illegal ballot harvesting. Several interviews of individuals were conducted. After the interviews became public, former Harris County Clerk Diane Troutman, resigned alleging health concerns due to COVID-19. However, witnesses have told me that Ms. Troutman was arguing with Commission Rodney Ellis about the legality of the mass purchasing and mailing of mail-in ballots and that Troutman was concerned she would be included in the eventual arrest pertaining to illegal ballot harvesting. Instead of coming forward and exposing the scheme, Ms. Troutman abruptly resigned. Witnesses have stated that Commissioner Ellis was not deterred and continued to move forward with the plan to mass mail ballots and expand the illegal ballot harvesting scam. Another witness stated to me that an employee of Commission Ellis, Tyler James, has bragged that he could guarantee that the illegal ballot harvesting operation, with the help of mass mail-in ballots, could harvest 700,000 illegal ballots.” “It appears that law enforcement agencies are currently investigating these alleged crimes and I will provide them with the evidence that I have already collected and am continuing to collect. Sadly, these law enforcement agencies will be working to prosecute these crimes well after the November 3, 2020 election.” Here Is The GoFundMe Page for the ongoing private investigation which is working with law enforcement. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton recently announced 134 felony charges against four defendants stemming from an alleged 2018 Democrat primary scheme to use fake disabilities provide mail-in ballots to people who were not disabled. The Democrat claim that fear of Coronavirus constitutes a disability has been only partially successful in Texas. Harris County is sending mail-in ballot applications to county voters 65 and over, so nursing homes remain a hotspot for potential fraud. Texas began mailing absentee ballots to voters for the presidential election on September 19. NATIONAL FILE RECENTLY REPORTED Citizen journalist Colleen Vera has discovered evidence of what appears to be a massive voter fraud ring operating in the state of Texas involving mail-in voting and Democrat political campaigns. Evidence presented below includes a video of a Democrat campaign surrogate harvesting mail ballots from a nursing home, audio of a Democrat campaign worker admitting to harvesting ballots from a nursing home, and mail-in ballots from Harris County that all have the same handwriting and envelope process. Vera alleges that the campaign of Democrat Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee recently paid two convicted forgers, and that other Democrat campaigns have also paid convicted forgers for canvassing efforts. I spoke to Collen Vera regarding her findings as well as longtime Democrat Party operative Gerry Monroe, who knows full well what is happening in Harris County: Breaking: Vote By Mail FRAUD BUSTED ON TAPE https://t.co/HjGmDauKxU — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) July 30, 2020 Colleen Vera of Texas Trash Talk Reports… After the 2016 Democratic Primary, a candidate for Harris County Constable (Pct 3), Jasen Rabalais, filed a lawsuit claiming that a campaign worker for another candidate,Michel Pappillion, “deliberately falsified, illegally completed or unlawfully influenced the ballots and early voting applications of elderly residents in Harris County.” The lawsuit was dismissed. But the following audio tapes had been made by the  Rabalais campaign  after he found out that an “alleged harvester” was working for an opponent’s campaign. Link to Audio #1:  Gives name of “alleged harvester” Link to Audio #2:  “Alleged harvester” explains the services provided (phone # redacted) Then during the 2018 Primary, the following video was posted by Direct Action Texas. It appeared to show a campaign worker for Texas State Rep Harold Dutton Jr harvesting ballots of 400 elderly voters. After viewing the video, I decided to do some research. I figured, if there was any evidence of mailed ballot voter fraud to be found in Harris County, the more recent one – Dutton’s race – was the best place to start. I filed a request for public information covering the 1359 voters who voted by mail in Harold Dutton’s race. I requested electronic copies of the voters’: My first thought was to match each voter’s mailed ballot application with the voter’s ballot envelope and compare signatures to find those which may not match. But as I reviewed the documents, something else jumped off the page… 32 hand written applications for mailed ballots – all from different voters – but all written in the exact same handwriting. Looking closer, something else jumped off the page. All 32 returned their application for a ballot by mail in the same pre-printed envelope with the same style stamp. … But then I printed out the envelopes which carried their returned ballots and the BIGGEST COINCIDENCE of ALL jumped off the page…ALL THESE VOTERS LIVED IN THE SAME PRECINCT!  Precinct #259…Additional research showed this same handwriting on multiple ballot by mail applications from precinct #259 every year going back to 2008…If that wasn’t enough to cause concern, I had to title this set of applications “Alleged Harvester A” because I found two more sets of multiple applications with similar handwriting, envelopes and stamps from varying precincts. I titled those “Alleged Harvester B” and “Alleged Harvester C.”… 30 ballots from Precinct #259 – in which the voters voted for ALL the same candidates – and they ALL used the same style “X” to mark their ballots. …I filed another public information request and received a handwritten sign out sheet for persons who had picked up packages of 50 or more applications for mailed ballots in 2018. Two concerning issues from that list. Federal Election Commission records show that US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee did make multiple payments to convicted forger Gloria Palmer in 2016: Texas Trash Talk passage ends (Collen Vera alleges that Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign has paid two convicted forgers, Gloria Palmer and Sheree Harris Fisher, as recently as February 2020. Records show that Sheila Jackson Lee vendor Gloria B. Palmer is the same age as Texas convicted forger Gloria B. Palmer. Vera alleges that Fisher is also a convicted forger)"
Barrett’s Nomination Moves To Senate Floor As Confirmation Looms,22 OCT 2020,1701,"Democrats are losing the battle to block a qualified and honorable appointment to the Supreme Court. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination, and she will now move to the confirmation phase on the Senate Floor. Democrats on the committee ‘boycotted’ the vote, however, Barrett is expected to be confirmed next week by a ‘narrow’ majority. Yahoo ‘reported’: Instead of appearing at the hearing, Democrats placed pictures of Americans who would be affected if the high court strikes down the Affordable Care Act. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 10, and the Trump administration is backing efforts challenging the health care law. [Many Americans hate Obamacare, and have been fighting its stupidity and unconstitutionally for years.] Democrats on the Judiciary said that they decided to boycott the hearing because they did not want to “grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.” [However, their non-participation doesn’t actually have anything to do with the “legitimacy” of the confirmation, since the Constitutional process was followed perfectly.] In 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to bring President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee to the floor, arguing that it was too close to the election and that the next president should decide. [Of course, McConnell had the majority at that time, and his action was correct, something that democrats seethe over.] If Barrett is elevated to the court, conservatives will solidify their majority. Six of the nine justices will have been appointed by Republicans."
"Bombshell: Whistleblower Witnessed Biden ‘Deal’ Discussion, Harris Listed As “Key Domestic Contact”",22 OCT 2020,14099,"Kamala Harris was part of the “key domestic contacts” listed in the now verified emails that have exposed the Biden Crime Family. And, a witness to Biden’s involvement with his son’s illegal business “deals” has also come forward. Breitbart News reported: A whistleblower CEO and Biden insider, Tony Bobulinski, released a public statement on Wednesday evening backing up the reporting of the New York Post from last week and claiming that he personally witnessed Democrat presidential nominee former Vice President Joe Biden discussing business deals with his son, Hunter Biden. Sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News that Bobulinski is the person whose allegations and inside information are the centerpiece of a forthcoming investigation by the Wall Street Journal. That Wall Street Journal story has not published yet, several days after the newspaper staff indicated to some the piece would come out—it is unclear why the Journal has not yet published—but President Donald Trump hinted on a conference call earlier this week that such a story was coming from the newspaper. Bobulinski’s statement also seemingly authenticates at least one of the bombshell emails obtained by the New York Post, purportedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop retrieved from a computer repair store in Delaware. The statement also contradicts claims from some Democrats that a Russian disinformation campaign is at the center of the burgeoning scandal currently engulfing the Biden campaign in the final days of the election. Bobulinski said in a press statement he released Wednesday night: My name is Tony Bobulinski. The facts set forth below are true and accurate; they are not any form of domestic or foreign disinformation. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and offensive. I am the recipient of the email published seven days ago by the New York Post which showed a copy to Hunter Biden and Rob Walker. That email is genuine. According to Bobulinski, the use of the term “the Big Guy” in one such email was a direct reference to Joe Biden himself. In that email, originally published by the New York Post and subsequently by several other outlets, there was a discussion of “remuneration packages” for six people involved in a business deal with the now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. Fox News described the email in a report citing an anonymous source confirming that the “Big Guy” was Joe Biden: The email includes a note that “Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate.” A proposed equity split references “20” for “H” and “10 held by H for the big guy?” with no further details. Bobulinski’s statement would be the first on-record confirmation of this from a source in the Biden universe. Bobulinski said: What I am outlining is fact. I know it is fact because I lived it. I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family. I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden. The reference to ‘the Big Guy’ in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden. The other ‘JB’ referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe’s brother. Screenshots published by the New York Post indicate that Bobulinski was one of the recipients of the email in question. The email was authored by James Gilliar of the consulting firm J2cR. Now that Bobulinski is publicly confirming the authenticity of this email, which, again, he was the recipient of, that furthers the story significantly, and Joe Biden’s presidential campaign does not deny their authenticity. That email was one of many that the New York Post published from Hunter Biden’s laptop. Others include emails where Hunter Biden described getting a meeting for Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma executives with his father during his time as Vice President. The emails have rocked the presidential campaign in the final weeks of the race, and Biden has called them a “smear” campaign against him. Twitter and Facebook, when the New York Post first published the emails, censored the content. Twitter originally–following Facebook’s lead–censored links to the original Post stories as “unsafe,” but later reversed course after backlash. The New York Post has been locked out of its Twitter account for several days since the story was published. Facebook, meanwhile, said it was preemptively holding back traffic to the stories until its fact-checkers weighed in–a rare step: While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking partners. In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) October 14, 2020 The social media censorship had mixed results: Twitter’s actions, according to an MIT study, actually drove more interest to the story. But Facebook’s actions, according to Newswhip data. severely limited the reach of the story to many users. Even so, nobody from Biden’s campaign has challenged their authenticity, even as some Democrats, such as the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), have claimed they represent Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. The FBI, Department of Justice, and Intelligence Community, however, have refuted those claims, with Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe stating unequivocally that they are not Russian interference. Ratcliffe, in an appearance on Mornings with Maria on Fox Business Network Monday, made clear the emails are not Russian disinformation: It is funny that some of the people that complain the most about intelligence being politicized are the ones politicizing intelligence. And, unfortunately, in this case, it is Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who, as you pointed out, said on Friday the intelligence community believes that Hunter Biden’s laptop and the emails on it are part of some Russian disinformation campaign. Let me be clear: The intelligence community doesn’t believe that, because there is no intelligence that supports that. We have shared no intelligence with chairman Adam Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden’s laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign. It’s simply not true. Bobulinski, the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings and a Biden insider, bolsters the case by speaking up. In his statement, he insists that the emails are not “any form of domestic or foreign disinformation” and that he comes from a military famil. He, his father, and his grandfather all served in the U.S. Navy. He also says that he has no “political ax to grind,” and that the only politicians he has donated to over the years are Democrats. Bobulinski said: I am the grandson of a 37 year Army Intelligence officer, the son of a 20+ year career Naval Officer and the brother of a 28 year career Naval Flight Officer. I myself served our country for 4 years and left the Navy as LT Bobulinski. I held a high level security clearance and was an instructor and then CTO for Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. I take great pride in the time my family and I served this country. I am also not a political person. What few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats. Bobulinski is the second longtime business associate of Hunter Biden to publicly turn against the Biden family in recent days. He joins Bevan Cooney, who turned over to Breitbart News senior contributor Peter Schweizer and journalist Matthew Tyrmand a total of 26,000 emails, in flipping against the Bidens. Cooney is currently serving a sentence in federal prison in Oregon for a conviction over deals he and other Hunter Biden business partners made in connection with Native American tribal investments. As Breitbart News reported on Tuesday night, Cooney was moved from his cell earlier this week–but Bureau of Prisons officials refused to comment on the matter, citing the safety and security of prisoners. A third Hunter Biden business partner, Devon Archer, was convicted in that Native American investment scheme. He previously saw a federal judge vacate his conviction, but it was later reinstated upon appeal and Archer awaits sentencing. Bobulinski is not connected to that activity and is connected to the Biden family because he says he was brought in to manage Sinohawk Holdings–a company that served as a “partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family”–by Hunter Biden himself, as well Biden family associate James Gilliar–again, the author of one of the emails in question published by the New York Post. This all comes in the wake of the U.S. Senate’s Homeland Security Committee, chaired by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), leading an investigation into the matter. Bobulinski said in his Wednesday night statement that he received a request from Johnson’s committee to provide documents and testimony in their investigation into the matter. He said he is cooperating with that investigation. Here is Bobulinski’s statement in full: My name is Tony Bobulinski. The facts set forth below are true and accurate; they are not any form of domestic or foreign disinformation.  Any suggestion to the contrary is false and offensive. I am the recipient of the email published seven days ago by the New York Post which showed a copy to Hunter Biden and Rob Walker. That email is genuine.  This afternoon I received a request from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance requesting all documents relating to my business affairs with the Biden family as well as various foreign entities and individuals. I have extensive relevant records and communications and I intend to produce those items to both Committees in the immediate future.  I am the grandson of a 37 year Army Intelligence officer, the son of a 20+ year career Naval Officer and the brother of a 28 year career Naval Flight Officer.  I myself served our country for 4 years and left the Navy as LT Bobulinski.  I held a high level security clearance and was an instructor and then CTO for Naval Nuclear Power Training Command.  I take great pride in the time my family and I served this country.  I am also not a political person. What few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats.  If the media and big tech companies had done their jobs over the past several weeks I would be irrelevant in this story.  Given my long standing service and devotion to this great country, I could no longer allow my family’s name to be associated or tied to Russian disinformation or implied lies and false narratives dominating the media right now. After leaving the military I became an institutional investor investing extensively around the world and on every continent. I have traveled to over 50 countries.  I believe, hands down, we live in the greatest country in the world. What I am outlining is fact.  I know it is fact because I lived it.  I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family.  I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden.  The reference to “the Big Guy” in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden.  The other “JB” referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe’s brother. Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing. I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line. I realized the Chinese were not really focused on a healthy financial ROI.  They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. Once I realized that Hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the Chinese, I took steps to prevent that from happening. The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me — it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn’t and wouldn’t do that to their partners. I would ask the Biden family to address the American people and outline the facts so I can go back to being irrelevant — and so I am not put in a position to have to answer those questions for them.  I don’t have a political ax to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned with what I saw. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China. God Bless America!!!! Fox News reported: A list of “key domestic contacts” for a joint venture involving Jim and Hunter Biden and now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. included former Vice President Joe Biden‘s current running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, among other prominent Democrats, Fox News has learned. An email exclusively obtained by Fox News, with the subject line “Phase one domestic contacts/ projects” and dated May 15, 2017, Biden’s brother, Jim Biden, shared a list of “key domestic contacts for phase one target projects.” The email is unrelated to the laptop or hard drive purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son. READ THE EMAIL HERE. The list, included Harris, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo; New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio; former Virginia Gov. Terry McCauliffe, among others. It is unclear if any of the Democrats were ever contacted about the “target projects.” The email was sent from Jim to Hunter Biden, Tony Bobulinski, Rob Walker and James Gilliar."
Biden’s “Struggling” Bar Owner Lie: Owner Is Wealthy Tech CEO And Dem Donor,21 OCT 2020,5805,"In yet another incident of democrat manipulation and lies, the Biden campaign is facing backlash after a political ad featuring a “struggling bar owner” turned out to be a wealthy tech CEO and democrat donor. Hannity reported: “The ad, which was posted to YouTube on Thursday and aired Sunday on CBS during NFL games, features Joe Malcoun, who is listed as the ‘co-owner’ of The Blind Pig, a once-popular bar and music venue in Ann Arbor, Mich. Malcoun blamed his business’ economic downturn on President Trump’s COVID-19 response,” reports Fox News. “For 50 years, The Blind Pig has been open and crowded – but right now it’s an empty room,” he says. “This is the reality of Trump’s COVID response.” “We don’t know how much longer we can survive not having any revenue. A lot of restaurants, bars that have been mainstays for years will not make it through this. This is Donald Trump’s economy,” he continued. “There’s no plan, you don’t know how to move forward. It makes me so angry. My only hope for my family and this business and my community is that Joe Biden wins this election. That’s the kind of person we need.” “What the ad fails to mention is the man is actually a wealthy tech investor who made contributions to the former vice president’s campaign. He also supported Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s stay-at-home orders that kept businesses shuttered longer,” adds Fox. Fox News explained: The Biden team is under fire for releasing a TV campaign ad last week depicting a Michigan bar owner struggling to keep his business afloat during the pandemic. What the ad fails to mention is the man is actually a wealthy tech investor who made contributions to the former vice president’s campaign. He also supported Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s stay-at-home orders that kept businesses shuttered longer. The ad, which was posted to YouTube on Thursday and aired Sunday on CBS during NFL games, features Joe Malcoun, who is listed as the “co-owner” of The Blind Pig, a once-popular bar and music venue in Ann Arbor, Mich. Malcoun blamed his business’ economic downturn on President Trump’s COVID-19 response. … [The ad claimed] “We don’t know how much longer we can survive not having any revenue. A lot of restaurants, bars that have been mainstays for years will not make it through this. This is Donald Trump’s economy,” he continued. “There’s no plan, you don’t know how to move forward. It makes me so angry. My only hope for my family and this business and my community is that Joe Biden wins this election. That’s the kind of person we need.” The ad also featured the song “Sabotage” by The Beastie Boys, marking the first time the group licensed one of its songs for use in a political advertisement. What Malcoun doesn’t say in the ad is that there’s a small chance he’ll face financial ruin if The Blind Pig goes under, given he’s a prominent “angel investor” in several local tech companies. In an April tweet Malcoun also praised Whitmer, arguing “she’s doing it right” by continuing the state’s stay-at-home order, which sparked protests and forced businesses like The Blind Pig to remain closed longer. Earlier this month, the Michigan Supreme Court struck down Whitmer’s orders to continue extending Michigan’s coronavirus-related state of emergency without legislative approval. The initial state of emergency was set to end on April 30 and Whitmer used executive powers to extend it. The Blind Pig briefly reopened in June, adhering to strict requirements such as requiring masks, enforcing social distancing, aggressive cleaning, and limited guests. But Malcoun told MLive in an interview at the time that he decided to cancel future live events for the summer, citing low attendance and difficulty communicating updated coronavirus rules to the public. “Now that we tried it and saw it’s really hard to communicate what it means to have a really socially distanced and live music show, we decided it’s not really worth trying. The very last thing we want is to be the epicenter of a new outbreak,” Malcoun told the newspaper. After inheriting money from his wife’s grandfather, which he likened to “winning the lottery,” Malcoun said he founded CKM Capital Partners in 2013 and eventually became an “angel investor” in local tech companies, according to a 2018 interview with Click On Detroit. He’s also served as CEO of Nutshell, a customer relationship management software company, since 2014, and under his leadership the firm raised at least $5.5 million in angel and venture capital, according to his Crain’s Detroit Business 40 under 40 profile. Malcoun also co-founded Cahoots, a co-working tech hub, and purchased three buildings in downtown Ann Arbor to host entrepreneurs. According to Federal Election Commission data, Malcoun donated $5,000 to Biden For President in July. The Biden campaign and Malcoun did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign also pulled a different TV ad after retired Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland raised concerns about depicting any military personnel in uniform in political messaging – for either Biden or President Trump – before Election Day, Politico reported. The ad included photos take in Iraq showing Biden walking beside MacFarland, who led the fight against the Islamic State from 2015 until 2016. “A number of people have understandably inferred that my appearance constitutes an endorsement of the former vice president. It does not,” MacFarland wrote last week in a since-deleted LinkedIn post. “To be clear, I have not endorsed President Trump, either. I’m not a political person, but this isn’t about just me. I object to the use of ANY military personnel in uniform in political ads – full stop. That goes double for generals and admirals, even if we have since retired, as I have.”"
"Trump Goes After CBS, Releases Video Of Maskless ‘Reporter,’ Promises To Release Full Interview",21 OCT 2020,5666,"President Trump recently participated in an interview with CBS’s Leslie Stahl, but it didn’t go well. Not only is the ‘editing process’ designed to make the president look bad, Stahl wasn’t wearing a mask either. So, President Trump has promised to release the full interview prior to the CBS broadcast, so that viewers can see how biased they are… Breitbart News reported: President Donald Trump on Tuesday released a short video of CBS reporter Lesley Stahl not wearing a mask at the White House following an interview with him. Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come. pic.twitter.com/0plZG6a4fH — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2020 The interview ended after the president sat with the journalist for 45 minutes at the White House, according to reports. “Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president also threatened to air the interview with Stahl himself before the program aired on Sunday. …Everyone should compare this terrible Electoral Intrusion with the recent interviews of Sleepy Joe Biden! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2020 Assistant Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also weighed in on Stahl’s behavior at the White House. “This is moments after she criticized me for not wearing a mask while working at my desk,” she wrote. “Rules for thee but not for me, Lesley?” Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found This is moments after she criticized me for not wearing a mask while working at my desk Rules for thee but not for me, Lesley? https://t.co/jOkiCEZSJT — Karoline Leavitt (@KLeavitt45) October 20, 2020 White House CNN reporters cited sources that said that the president abruptly ended the interview and did not return for a scheduled “walk and talk” shot with Vice President Mike Pence. Apparently there was some drama while President Trump was taping his 60 Minutes interview today. He abruptly ended his solo interview after around 45 minutes & did not return for a scheduled walk & talk he was supposed to tape with Pence, @abdallahcnn and I are told by sources. — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) October 20, 2020 The New York Post reported: President Trump on Tuesday tweeted a video of a mask-free “60 Minutes” anchor Lesley Stahl which was taken following a White House interview he reportedly stormed out of. In a subsequent missive, the commander-in-chief threatened to spoil CBS News’ big scoop by sharing the footage before it airs on Sunday evening, calling the sit-down “fake and biased.” “Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come,” the president tweeted to his 87 million followers. He later tweeted: “I am pleased to inform you that, for the sake of accuracy in reporting, I am considering posting my interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, PRIOR TO AIRTIME! This will be done so everybody can get a glimpse of what a FAKE and BIASED interview is all about… Everyone should compare this terrible Electoral Intrusion with the recent interviews of Sleepy Joe Biden!” In the six-second clip shared by Trump, Stahl can be seen smiling and speaking with two unidentified masked men while holding a stack of papers and notes in front of her chest. It’s unclear if Stahl knew she was being filmed or who took the video. According to a CNN report, the commander-in-chief abruptly stormed out of the interview with Stahl after about 45 minutes of questioning. The president was also meant to appear with Vice President Mike Pence but did not return to the room when his veep arrived, the report said. The crisis grew when White House Assistant Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly accused Stahl of criticizing her for not wearing a mask in the West Wing. “This is moments after she criticized me for not wearing a mask while working at my desk. Rules for thee but not for me, Lesley?” Leavitt wrote in a tweet sharing the video. A New York Times report published Tuesday evening said that the president cut the interview short when he became irritated with Stahl’s questioning, citing two people familiar with the situation. Trump also ended the interview when it ran longer than his aides expected it to, the report said. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany also weighed-in on the anticipated “60 Minutes” interview, sharing a photo on Twitter of her handing an enormous book to Stahl which reportedly contained the president’s health care achievements. “She couldn’t believe how HUGE it was and said, “I can hardly lift this!!” McEnany wrote, sharing a picture of a stunned Stahl holding the book. Both Democratic nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris were also interviewed by “60 Minutes,” with all of the sit-downs meant to air on Sunday — just nine days ahead of the presidential election on Nov. 3. Reporters granted interviews with Trump and Pence are tested for the coronavirus before they are allowed to be in the same room as them as part of the White House’s COVID-19 containment measures. Trump has since recovered after testing positive for the disease earlier this month. Stahl also contracted the virus and was hospitalized for a week. In a clip promoting the upcoming interviews, the veteran broadcaster promised “revealing, provocative conversations” with both candidates. The pair last met for a contentious interview in 2018 where the “60 Minutes” anchor pressed Trump on his views on climate change and Russian interference in the 2016 election but the president finished the interview."

State Board Rules On Petition To Recall Michigan Attorney General Over COVID Restrictions,16 OCT 2020,3272,"In Michigan, the people are chafing under totalitarian rule. Under the auspices of ‘public health,’ using a virus that has a greater survival rate than the flu, democrats have instituted unconstitutional lockdowns and mandates designed to erase personal liberty. However, the people are fighting back. Petitions to recall the democrat governor have progressed, and now another recall petition has gotten the green light, which if successful, would remove the Attorney General. MLive reported: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has joined the list of state leaders with recall attempts being sought against them related to the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, Oct. 15, the Board of State Canvassers approved petition language aimed at recalling Nessel for her plans to ramp up enforcement efforts of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order regarding enhanced protections for residents and staff of long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The petition was submitted by Albion resident Chad Baase, who is working to recall Nessel and Whitmer, along with Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. It was his fifth attempt to get approval to move ahead with his petition to recall Nessel. Now Baase will seek more than 1.06 million resident signatures, within a 60-day period, to earn a spot on a future ballot. Thursday’s meeting was held in-person at The G. Mennen Williams Building Auditorium in Lansing. It was the first Board of State Canvassers meeting not held virtually for months, and Baase said he was notified of the move to an in-person setting on Wednesday. Baase plans to begin collecting signatures to recall Whitmer, Gilchrist and Benson on Nov. 1. He said he’ll have petitions at all of the state’s polling locations on election day and will “double-back” with those who sign them to see if they want Nessel recalled at a later date, once her appeals window closes. The official reason for recall on the petition will read: Dana Nessel, on Thursday, August 6, 2020, Announced plans ramping up efforts to enforce Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Executive Order 2020-148. Baase said his reason for aiming to recall Nessel is her enforcement of the governor’s executive orders, which he called unconstitutional. Earlier this month, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that a 1945 state law Whitmer used to sign executive orders during the extended COVID-19 state of emergency was unconstitutional. The court said Whitmer did not have the authority to continue a state of emergency without the support of the Legislature, essentially ending her orders signed past April 30. “(Nessel) violated her oath of office by enforcing an executive order which violated the Michigan constitution, therefore she violated the constitution,” Baase said. “She needs to be held accountable.” Baase, an entrepreneur who paints and maintains water towers, was paroled from prison in February, where he was serving two years and six months to 20 years for a 2014 conviction of making a false report or threat of terrorism. He previously told MLive he was intoxicated when he sent a series of threatening Facebook messages related to a custody case and said he has since learned to use “the proper legal protocols to get things done.”"
Federal Court Rules On Whether DC Church Is Allowed To Hold Outdoor Services,15 OCT 2020,1954,"The democrat mayor of Washington D.C. has decided that churches can’t meet… even when services are held outside. The direct violation of the First Amendment seems to be old news now, but fortunately, one church in the nation’s capital has fought that control… and has won. Just the News reported: A federal court handed a victory to a Baptist church in Washington D.C., issuing a preliminary injunction against Mayor Muriel Bowser’s COVID-19 restrictions that will allow the church to hold outdoor services Sunday with proper precautions. The “church has shown that it is likely to succeed in proving that the District’s actions impose a substantial burden on its exercise of religion,” the U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden ruled. “For its part, the District has not shown that it is likely to prove a compelling interest in prohibiting the Church from holding outdoor worship services with appropriate precautions, or that its restrictions are the least restrictive means available to achieve its public health objectives.” File DCChurchRulingPrelimInjunction.pdf The ruling in favor of Capitol Hill Baptist Church was immediately applauded by the Trump Justice Department, which filed a statement of interest supporting the church. File usa_stmt_of_interest_-_capitol_hill_baptist_ecf_0.pdf “In the heart of our nation’s capital, Washington, D.C., a federal district court ruled that the fundamental right of all Americans to worship endures during our COVID-19 response,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband said. “Last night’s decision is a victory for religious liberty and the rule of law. “In an overwhelming vote, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in order to guarantee our nation’s first freedom is always upheld. The Department of Justice is grateful the court ruled preliminarily with this in mind and is grateful that members of Capitol Hill Baptist Church will be able to worship together on Sunday,” he added."
Nancy Pelosi Goes Nuts: Freaks Out When CNN Actually Asks Question,14 OCT 2020,6080,"Yesterday afternoon, Nancy Pelosi appeared on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, probably expecting to get plenty of softball ‘questions,’ designed to attack President Trump. But when Blitzer had the audacity to actually ask a legitimate question about why Pelosi is stalling the stimulus bill, which would provide relief to Americans still out of work—without massive bundles of cash for failing democrat states—Pelosi went off on a rant that was both confusing and condescending. In fact, her whole diatribe was based on the Marie Antoinette claim that she knows what is best for the peasants. Fox News reported: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday of being “an apologist … for the Republican position” during a stunning interview in which she grew visibly frustrated with “The Situation Room” anchor’s questions. The fireworks began when Blitzer asked Pelosi why she “won’t accept the president’s latest [coronavirus] stimulus offer.” “I hope you’ll ask the same question of the Republicans on why they don’t want to meet the needs of the American people,” Pelosi responded. “But let me say to those people because all of my colleagues — we represent these people … and their needs are not addressed in the president’s proposal. So when you say to me, ‘Why don’t you accept theirs?’ Why don’t they accept ours?” Blitzer interjected, telling Pelosi that Americans “really need the money now” and quoted Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who recently said, “People in need can’t wait until February. $1.8 trillion is significant & more than twice the Obama stimulus … Make a deal & put the ball in McConnell court.” “So what do you say to Ro Khanna?” Blitzer asked. “What I say to you is I don’t know why you’re always an apologist — and many of your colleagues [are] apologists for the Republican position,” Pelosi fired back, adding “Ro Khanna, that’s nice, that isn’t what we’re going to do and nobody’s waiting til February.” The contentious exchange continued when Blitzer pressed Pelosi again about Trump’s $1.8 trillion proposal, asking her, “why not work out a deal with him and don’t let the perfect, as they say here in Washington, be the enemy of the good?” “Well, I will not let the wrong be the enemy of the right,” Pelosi fired back. “What’s wrong with $1.8 trillion?” Blitzer asked. “You know what, do you have any idea what the difference is between the spending that they have in their bill and what we have in our bill?” Pelosi asked before ticking off a list of her issues with the proposal. “That is precisely why, Madame Speaker … it’s so important right now,” Blitzer responded “Yesterday, I spoke to [former Democratic presidential candidate] Andrew Yang, who says the same thing. It’s not everything you want but there’s a lot there.” “But you know what? Honest to God!” Pelosi complained. “You really- I cannot get over it because Andrew Yang, he’s lovely. Ro Khanna, he’s lovely. They are not negotiating this situation. They have no idea of the particulars. They have no idea of what the language is here … The tension carried on until the very end, when Blitzer attempted to wrap up the interview after the speaker accused him of “defending the administration all this time.” “We’ll leave it on the note that you’re not right on this, Wolf, and I hate to say that to you,” Pelosi told the CNN anchor. “But I feel confident about it and I feel confident about my colleagues and I feel confident in my [committee] chairs.” Blitzer responded, “It’s not about me, it’s about millions of Americans who can’t put food on the table, who can’t pay the rent, and who are having trouble getting by.” “And we represent them, we represent them,” Pelosi repeated several times over Blitzer. “As we say, don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good,” Blitzer reiterated. “It is nowhere near perfect … we’re not even close to the good,” Pelosi shot back. “Thank you for your sensitivity to our constituents’ needs.” “I am sensitive to them because I see them on the street begging for food, begging for money,” the anchor said. “Have you fed them?” Pelosi blurted out. “We feed them, we feed them.” Tuesday was not the first time the speaker verbally attacked a journalist during an interview. In August, Pelosi lashed out at “PBS NewsHour” anchor Judy Woodruff, accusing her of being an “advocate” for Republicans during another heated negotiating period on coronavirus relief. Conservative Treehouse nailed it by reporting: The hubris and condescension in this video snippet are quite remarkable, especially when we consider that Wolf Blitzer is a fellow traveler, friend and ally of Pelosi, and professional narrative engineer for the political left. After being asked a question about her refusal to accept a compromise $1.8 trillion spending package for COVID-19 economic impacts, Nancy Pelosi has a total meltdown.  Pelosi is so unfamiliar with even gentle push-back, she cannot fathom an alternate point of position that does not carry exclusive democrat political benefit.  This is wild:   Others have called for Pelosi to take a mental test and be subject to the ‘25th’ Amendment task force. She all but calls Wolf Blitzer a right wing hack for daring to question her grace — she calls him “an apologist for the Obama Administration.” Yeah, she meant “Trump.” But of course she’s senile. Can we get a 25th Amendment process to determine if she’s fit to serve? She is third in line for the presidency. Where are her mental test results? Nancy Pelosi is asked a simple question, and she immediately resorts to name-calling. So I'll ask her again here: Speaker Pelosi: Why not make a deal? Millions of Americans are hurting while you single-handedly block support for workers and families. pic.twitter.com/KLbaDKgQv8 — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 13, 2020 ""What I say to you is, I don't know why you're always an apologist, and many of your colleagues, apologists for the Republican position"" — Nancy Pelosi didn't have much patience this evening for Wolf Blitzer pic.twitter.com/28SsQjdHZ4 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 13, 2020"
Michigan High Court Slaps Down Whitmer’s ‘Request’ For Extended ‘Emergency Power’,13 OCT 2020,2357,"In Michigan, Democrat governor Gretchen Whitmer has acted like an authoritarian ruler since the COVID ‘crisis’ began, refusing to allow citizens basic rights, and going above and beyond with her targeted restrictions. In an effort to control the out-of-control totalitarian democrat, the state’s conservatives have been working to halt her massive power grab. A recent ruling from the state Supreme Court shut down her arbitrary decisions to stop the spread of the ‘pandemic,’ but Whitmer decided that she wanted another ruling on “extended emergency powers.” However, the Supreme Court of Michigan has said “no.” Fox News reported: The Michigan Supreme Court on Monday denied Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s request to extend emergency powers that she invoked to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The court rejected the Democratic governor’s request to delay the effect of its decision striking down a law she had used to keep intact sweeping orders amid the pandemic. The justices voted 6-1 against halting the precedential effect of its Oct. 2 opinion until Oct. 30. They reaffirmed their initial 4-3 ruling that declared unconstitutional her use of the 1945 emergency powers law. Executive orders issued under the law “are of no continuing legal effect. This order is effective upon entry,” the court wrote. Whitmer had asked the justices to give her administration, lawmakers and local health departments 28 days to transition in the wake of the major decision. Last week, her administration quickly reinstituted mask requirements, gathering limits and other restrictions with orders issued by the state health department under a different law. [She was photographed without one though, highlighting her supreme hypocrisy.] Separately, legislators and Whitmer are negotiating legislation related to other orders negated by the decision, including an extension of unemployment benefits to 26 weeks from 20 weeks. The ruling caused some confusion because it reached the Supreme Court in an unconventional way. A federal judge overseeing a lawsuit that makes state and federal claims about Whitmer’s powers asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of two laws related to gubernatorial emergency powers. The Supreme Court ruled in a similar case brought by the GOP-controlled House and Senate and said in an order that the decision is effective immediately."
"Obey: New England Medical Journal Promotes Forced Vaccinations Through Punishment, Lies",12 OCT 2020,4399,"The New England Journal of Medicine wants to force all people to receive vaccines… and those who don’t, will be severely punished. In fact, they promote the idea that “mandates” should not be issued, because pesky things like “due process” and other constitutional freedoms get in the way of that… so governments and medical ‘leaders’ must simply enforce this new fascism through social shunning, job loss, and loss of personal liberty. Natural News reported: Welcome to the new medical fascism of 2020. The New England Journal of Medicine, the same fake science rag that committed total fraud to dishonestly smear hydroxychloroquine and protect the interests of vaccine companies, is now saying that all human beings must be forced to take mandatory vaccines. Those who refuse should face severe punishment, the NEJM insists, and insidious measures should be pursued to make sure no one can challenge the punishments in a court of law. Source: Ensuring Uptake of Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, October 1, 2020, N Engl J Med 2020; 383:1296-1299 “[B]ecause of the infectiousness and dangerousness of the virus, relatively substantive penalties could be justified, including employment suspension or stay-at-home orders for persons in designated high-priority groups who refuse vaccination,” says the NEJM paper. It also states that authoritarian medical personnel should bypass due process so that no one can challenge their orders in a court of law, stating, “Neither fines nor criminal penalties should be used, however… criminal penalties invite legal challenges on procedural due-process grounds [and] may stoke distrust.” It goes on to explain that vaccine mandates should not be promoted as mandates. Instead, those who refuse vaccines should be harshly punished as a way to force the mandates without ever declaring it. “[S]tate mandates should not be structured as compulsory vaccination (absolute requirements); instead, noncompliance should incur a penalty,” the paper states. And then, incredibly, the same paper goes on to claim that health authorities must “build public trust” through a “transparent and inclusive process,” even though the same paper openly claimed the public should be misled and coerced into vaccine mandates. To its credit, the paper does argue that vaccine manufacturers should not be involved in crafting public policy or pushing mandates, since no one trusts the vaccine companies anymore. (Amazing how quickly that happened, isn’t it?) So the bottom line here is as follows: Thanks to covid-19 tyrants, the whole idea of “informed consent” is now ancient history across the medical science establishment. Vaccine promoters believe they are the new “Judge Dredd” enforcers of society, and they believe that their experimental concoctions, no matter how risky or dangerous, should be forcibly injected into all human beings. Those who resist should be severely punished, they claim, and they will punish you in a way that you can’t challenge in a court of law. And the fake news media is 100% behind all this and will shame you if you don’t go along. Watch the warning from Dr. Carrie Madej in a new interview from just a few day ago: In effect, they are rolling out a “vaccine social credit scoring” system that demands your compliance What you’re watching here is a vaccine social credit scoring system being rolled out across America, right in front of our eyes. Don’t want the vaccine shot? You’re fired from your job. Still don’t want the shot? You’ll be prohibited from entering grocery stores and buying food. Resisting the vaccine mandates? Health “authorities” will lock you in your own home, making you a prisoner without ever hauling you into court where you might be able to offer a defense against imprisonment. This is the new covid-19 / vaccine authoritarian tyranny, and it’s being rolled out right this very minute, right in front of you, all across America. New York has just announced a second wave of lockdowns, and no one is resisting. The sheeple will line up for the slaughter, and they will not speak out or resist as they are bled to death in the name of global population control. Anyone stupid enough to agree to be vaccinated is too stupid to represent the future of the human race. They will be systematically culled with the kill shot. How else will the globalists achieve their goal of exterminating over six billion humans, after all?"
Totalitarian Dem Gov. Won’t Release Election Results According to “Artificial Deadlines”,12 OCT 2020,2375,"Democrat governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has issued authoritarian decree after decree. She has placed a stranglehold on the population of her state using a the ‘plandemic’ COVID health excuse, and is now exploiting the virus (that has a better survival rate than the common flu) to withhold election results. Fox News reported: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Sunday said her state will not rush to ensure all the results of the 2020 presidential race are counted on Election Day, Nov. 3 — a date she appeared to imply was artificially set. [You know, that pesky “artificial deadline” that has been a hallmark of the free republic for decades.] The Democratic governor made the comments during an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” while discussing the election’s expected surge in mail-in votes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Asked by host Margaret Brennan how long it will take Michigan to declare the winner of the race, Whitmer would not give a definitive timeline. “Michigan will be able to announce results, but we are not going to have artificial deadlines set by, you know, people with political agendas,” Whitmer said. “It will be soon after polls close. I’m not going to put a number on it, but we’re going to get it right.” [Many people ask what Whitmer’s definition of “right” is… does that mean she’ll prevent the results from being released until they have ‘harvested’ enough ballots for the ‘right’ democrat outcome?] Whitmer reminded viewers that they can cast their ballots now so “every day between now and Nov. 3rd in Michigan is Election Day.” She added: “And the more people that vote earlier, the more likely you’ll be safe and get counted.” The conversation turned to poll monitoring, with Brennan citing a CBS News poll that found “half of the president’s voters in Michigan think the president should encourage supporters to go stand near polling places as watchers.” Asked whether she thinks there is the possibility of violence on Election Day, Whitmer said she was not worried and that her state was fully prepared. “I’m not worried, but we are preparing to make sure that we do everything to keep people safe,” Whitmer said. “And I’ve got incredible confidence. I know that the people of Michigan want to vote. We see how the stakes are in this election. We’re going to have historic turnout, and we’re going to do it right.”"
Comprehensive List Of Kamala’s 33 Lying Lies Spewed During The Debate,9 OCT 2020,18687,"If you watched the debate on Wednesday between Vice President Mike pence and Kamala Harris, you probably know about the fly and Harris’s pathetic facial contortions. But, there may have been a few things you missed… like the (at least) 33 lies Kamala was allowed to voice, without being contradicted. No doubt about it… she’s a liar. Political Pistachio put together a comprehensive list of her falsehoods: ► Lie: 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months (due to COVID-19). Truth: CDC admitted numbers are being padded and that actually only 9,210 have died due to COVID-19 alone. ► Lie: Frontline workers that have been treated like sacrificial workers? Truth: After seeing what was happening to frontline emergency workers in Italy, the Trump administration took early action to work to ensure that kind of problem did not happen in the U.S. ► Lie: Over 30 million people filed for unemployment during the last month. Truth: Department of Labor reports about between 837,000 and 879,000 new initial claims each of the weeks September, which adds up to less than 4 million new claims for the month.  The report further explains the total number of people claiming benefits in all programs for the week ending September 12 was 26,529,810, an increase of 484,856 from the previous week.  It is also likely that a considerable amount of those who are on unemployment are more likely as a result of shut-down orders by Democrat Governors in Blue States than any action taken by the Trump administration. ► Lie: In January the Trump administration knew the dangers of the coronavirus and did not tell the American Public…imagine if you knew on January 28th? … they knew and they covered it up.   Truth: January 3: CDC Director Robert Redfield sent an email to the director of the Chinese CDC, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus.   January 5: CDC Director Redfield sent another email to the Chinese CDC Director, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak,   January 6: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a level I travel notice for Wuhan, China due to the spreading coronavirus.   January 7: The CDC established a coronavirus incident management system to better share and respond to information about the virus.   January 11: The CDC updated a Level 1 travel health notice for Wuhan, China.   January 17: The CDC began implementing public health entry screening at the 3 U.S. airports that received the most travelers from Wuhan – San Francisco, New York JFK, and Los Angeles.   January 20: Dr. Fauci announces the National Institutes of Health is already working on the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus.   January 21: The CDC activated its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support to the coronavirus response.   January 23: The CDC sought a “special emergency authorization” from the FDA to allow states to use its newly developed coronavirus test.   January 27: President Trump tweeted that he made an offer to President Xi Jinping to send experts to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak.   January 27: The CDC issued a level III travel health notice urging Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to China due to the coronavirus.   January 27: The White House Coronavirus Task Force started meeting to help monitor and contain the spread of the virus and provide updates to the President.   January 29: The White House announced the formation of the Coronavirus Task Force to help monitor and contain the spread of the virus and provide updates to the President.   January 31: The Trump Administration: Declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. Announced Chinese travel restrictions. Suspended entry into the United States for foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the coronavirus. Source: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/timeline-the-trump-administrations-decisive-actions-to-combat-the-coronavirus/ ► Lie: The President said it [the coronavirus] was a hoax. Truth: Even the Associated Press indicated that the Biden Camp claiming Trump said the coronavirus was a hoax was not true.  He was calling their politicization of it their “latest hoax.” ► Lie: “You know this administration took the word ‘science’ off the website?” Truth: The word “science” was not scrubbed from U.S. government websites by the Trump Administration, and that fact was even confirmed as not true by liberal left NBC News. ► Lie: They still don’t have a plan. Truth: Trump administration’s plans regarding coronavirus began out the gate at a time the Democrats were claiming the alleged virus was nothing to worry about. ► Lie: Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. Truth: The Washington Examiner reports that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” in The New York Times’ reporting regarding Trump’s taxes.  The Times’ reporting also ignores that the President paid $7.4 million in federal taxes in 2017, not $750. ► Lie: [Donald Trump] passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. Truth:  Fact Check dot org explains that the claim is out of context, and not necessarily true.  The plan to cut taxes wound up reducing the tax burden for just about everyone across the board.  Later in the debate Harris claims they plan to only raise the taxes for people making $400,000 per year or more after Pence claimed Biden supports raising everyone’s taxes.  Even if Kamala’s claim is true, and the increase of taxation will only affect the top earners, the tax burden would largely land on those who own businesses, or are high ranking persons in these corporations, who do the hiring, and who adjust prices of their products based on the company’s cost to do business.  So, Biden’s plan would reduce hiring, and pass the tax on to the average workers (and newly unemployed) with higher prices of products … an economics lesson they have apparently never understood. ► Lie: Trump’s tax cuts led to a two trillion dollar deficit. Truth: After the tax plan, because of the growing economy as a result of the tax cuts, federal tax revenue increased.  According to the Institute for Policy Innovation, “federal revenue has consistently increased in the years after the Trump tax cuts. Despite the enormous tax cut, federal revenue increased by $10 billion in 2018, by $130 billion in 2019, and was projected to grow by even more in 2020 before the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic effects.” ► Lie: Joe Biden will only raise taxes on those who make more than $400,000 per year. Truth: The Tax Foundation concluded Biden’s plan would lead to higher taxes “across all income groups.” ► Lie: Trump’s investment in infrastructure never happened. Truth:  President Trump released an infrastructure plan more than two years ago.  Congress, specifically the Democrats in the House of Representatives, have blocked his call to invest in our infrastructure.  In February 2018, President Trump unveiled a plan to spur $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure spending.  The President included his infrastructure plan in both his FY 2019 and his FY 2020 budgets. ► Lie: Trump’s tax plan led American companies to go offshore to do their business. Truth:  Common sense indicates that if they got the tax breaks Harris claims the big corporations got, they wouldn’t take their businesses off shore.  They’d stay where the tax breaks favor them.  Therefore, without even having to go very deep, it is obvious her statement contradicts earlier statements.  That said, in 2012 the Washington Post was very critical of the Obama administration for the number of jobs under his watch going overseas.  During the Trump presidency not only has Trump brought back jobs from overseas, a list that includes some very high-profile companies, but by March of 2019 the boost of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. had leaped 399%. ► Lie: Joe Biden will not end fracking. Truth: Biden has not only said he plans to end fracking, but he plans to end fossil fuel consumption in America. ► Lie: Affordable Care Act brought health care to over 20 million Americans. Truth: According to the Census Bureau, the number of uninsured Americans has been on the rise since the creation of the Affordable Care Act. ► Lie: Trump is working to take away protection for those with pre-existing conditions. Truth: President Trump has signed an executive order designed to, in addition to other things, protect those with pre-existing conditions.  President Trump has made protecting “all pre-existing conditions” a key point in his second term agenda. ► Lie: The West Coast of the United States is burning, the East Coast is being battered by storms, Iowa crops destroyed because of floods, Joe believes in science (in discussion about Climate Change) … “an existential threat to us as human beings.” Truth: Fires in west largely due to poor forest management.  Science has shown that the number of hurricanes and the severity of the storms has not increased.  University of Newcastle’s (UON) fresh research found further evidence to support the notion that severe flooding events occur cyclically, challenging the widely approved assumption that floods occur randomly, or that any change in flooding could be due to the notion of man-made climate change.   ► Lie: “The Vice President earlier referred to what he thinks is an accomplishment that the president’s trade war with China. He lost that trade war. You lost it.” Truth: One of the things Americans appreciate about President Trump is that he stands firm against those who would stand against American Liberty and American Prosperity. China is one such adversary. Therefore, President Trump has confronted China’s unfair trade practices.  His administration has “successfully used tariffs to persuade China to sign a Phase One Trade Agreement that secured significant protections for American workers and businesses.”  In addition to that, he got the Chinese communists to purchase an additional $32 billion in U.S. farm goods over the next two years. ► Lie: America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs because of Trump’s trade war with China. Truth: As of two years ago, according to Forbes, manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has increased ten times what it was during the Obama administration, thanks to Trump’s policies.  Numbers have not boomed so loudly since then, but that is largely due to Democrat policies by States regarding the coronavirus scamdemic. ► Lie: The Obama-Biden Administration created within the White House an office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They [Trump] got rid of it Truth: Multiple sources have claimed this is not true; Former NSC Senior Director Tim Morrison, Former NSC staffer Richard Goldberg, Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, and even the leftwing rag, USA Today. ► Lie: “Look at the Iran nuclear deal [regarding Trump ending it] which now has put us in a position where we are less safe because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal.” Truth:  Actually, the deal was designed to make it easier for Iran to achieve a nuclear arsenal.  By ending the deal and increasing sanctions on Iran which has adversely affected their economy, Trump has helped quell the danger that Iran once posed during the Obama administration. ► Lie: Trump referred to severe head injuries suffered by military personnel as simply “headaches”. Truth:  President Trump was simply referring to what he had heard in a report. He said, “I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report, it is not very serious.”  If he had been misinformed, that is not the President downplaying the head injuries suffered by military personnel. Reports later confirmed that at least 11 U.S. soldiers had been airlifted from Iraq to medical centers in Germany and Kuwait for further evaluation and treatment of possible traumatic brain injuries from the rocket attack.  When later asked about his “headaches” response in light of the new information, he stated he had been advised of the details “numerous days later,” and that regarding the severity of the injuries “you’d have to ask the Department of Defense.”  Later, he stated that “No, I don’t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I’ve seen. I’ve seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our troops. I’ve seen people with no legs and with no arms. I’ve seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, that war. In fact, many cases those bombs [were] put there by Soleimani, who’s no longer with us.”  The average person does not recognize how severe a traumatic brain injury can be because they can’t “see” it.  If President Trump does underestimate the seriousness of a head trauma, he’s not alone, and the list of those who don’t give a traumatic brain injury enough credence includes a long list of medical personnel in the Veteran’s Administration system.  I know this personally. ► Lie: Trump referred to our personnel in the military as “suckers and losers”. Truth: Multiple witnesses not only state that Trump never said the “suckers and losers” remark, but that he didn’t even have a chance to visit the cemetery in question on the day he allegedly said such remark due to bad weather. ► Lie: Russia put bounties on the heads of American Troops. Truth: Any evidence regarding the claim is based on uncorroborated evidence, which has been echoed by many persons in the federal government, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper. ► Lie: “In 1864 … Abraham Lincoln was up for re-election, and it was 27 days before the election. And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln’s party was in charge not only of the White House but of the Senate. But Honest Abe said that it’s not the right thing to do.” Truth: According to National Review:  Lincoln, of course, said no such thing. He sent no nominee to the Senate in October 1864 because the Senate was out of session until December. He sent a nominee the day after the session began, and Salmon P. Chase was confirmed the same day. And Lincoln wanted to dangle the nomination before Chase and several other potential candidates because he wanted them to campaign for him. Lincoln’s priority was winning the election, which was necessary to win the war — and he filled the vacancy at the first possible instant.  Kamala Harris is simply inventing history. ► Lie: Packing the Supreme Court. Truth: While Harris and Biden have essentially dodged the question about packing the Supreme Court, and Harris tried to make it seem like it was not something she would consider during the debate, Harris in the past has indicated that she is open to the idea. ► Lie: [Trump] has refused to condemn white supremacists. Truth: This old claim by the liberal left Democrats has been debunked repeatedly.  President Trump said during the first debate, “I’m prepared to do it”.  He has repeatedly and specifically denounced white supremacists and racist hate groups.  He did it in 2016, he said it in August of 2017, twice.  And in August of 2019 Trump specifically said, “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.” ► Lie: “He called Mexicans rapists and criminals.” Truth: This same claim was made during the Vice Presidential debate in 2016, as well.  Breitbart reported, back then, In his June 16, 2015 speech announcing his run for the presidency, Donald Trump said the following:  When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically.  The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.  Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. Trump was referring to “some” of the people mixed into the population of illegal aliens crossing the border. ► Lie: He [Trump] instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. Truth: The first list of countries on the first “travel ban” was based on a list of “countries of concern” compiled by the Obama administration.  In later executive orders regarding the travel restrictions North Korea and Venezuela were added, adding to the reality that the policy was less about Islam, and more about threats to the United States. ► Lie: Regarding racists and white supremacists at Charlottesville, when asked about it, Trump said they were fine people. Truth: This has been fact-checked and debunked a number of times.  When taken into full context, he was saying that among the people in Charlottesville, while some were neo-nazis and white supremacists, among the crowds were also fine people. ► Lie: “I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full-time.” Truth: As California’s Attorney General, Harris did not mandate body cameras statewide.  In fact, in 2015, Harris said that she did not believe in statewide standards for police body cameras. ► Lie: Trump will resist a peaceful transition of power. Truth: It has been the Democrats who have stood against a peaceful end to the election.  Hillary Clinton told Biden not to concede, no matter what, for example.  The Democrats had trouble enough accepting the results of the 2016 election, and some may say they have still not accepted those results. ► Lie: “If we use our voice, we will win, and we will not let anyone subvert our democracy with what Donald Trump has been doing, as he did on the main stage last week, he openly attempted to suppress the vote.” Truth: Harris was likely referring to Trump’s comments regarding keeping an eye open at the polls because of his concern regarding voter fraud.  These are the same Democrats who believe that Voter ID laws are also an attempt to suppress the vote (rather than guard against fraud), even though they are fine with requiring identification to be shown in order to enter Democrat Candidate townhalls, for DNC delegates to vote, or to enter and vote in labor union meetings.  Trump was not trying to suppress the vote, he was indicating he wishes the election to be honest, without fraud.  But, if fraud is going on, it ought to be reported."
"Debate Commission Changes Rules, But Trump Physician Weighs In With ‘Science’",9 OCT 2020,2169,"After the dismal performance of smirky-Kamala Harris on Wednesday, the Commission on Presidential Debates tried to change the rules and arrange “virtual” debates for Joe Biden. However, the Trump campaign refused, and now the president’s physician has given him the all clear starting Saturday. There’s really no question now that Biden was being fed the answers in the last debate. Breitbart News reported: White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Thursday that President Donald Trump would likely be cleared for public engagements by Saturday after his treatment for the coronavirus. “Saturday will be day 10 since Thursday’s diagnosis and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the president’s safe return to public engagements at that time,” Conley said in a memo shared with reporters. He said the president had completed his therapy for the coronavirus. Conley said that Trump’s physical exam remained “stable” and that he was responding well to the treatments he was taking. President Trump’s campaign soon issued a statement demanding that the scheduled debate for Tuesday take place in person, citing “no medical reason” for the Commission on Presidential Debates to shift to a virtual debate. The commission announced their unilateral decision to shift the debate to a virtual format on Thursday morning, prompting President Donald Trump’s refusal to participate. The campaign questioned the timing of the decision, noting that they did not consult experts about the president’s health before changing the terms of the debate. “The commission must stop protecting Joe Biden from this in-person debate and allow the event to proceed as it was agreed to months ago,” Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien said. “The American people can see through this obvious attempt to shield Biden from another shellacking like he got two weeks ago in Cleveland and the CPD must reverse course and let the debate proceed.” UPDATE: Trump campaign agrees to Biden proposal to pushing the second debate to October 22 and a third debate on October 29 pic.twitter.com/Nbc0oLnmNj — Sara Cook (@saraecook) October 8, 2020"
Whitmer Blames Trump For Saving Her From Anti-Trump Anarchist’s Kidnapping Plot,9 OCT 2020,4939,"The FBI thwarted a kidnapping plot against Michigan democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Those who were planning it are anarchists, whose social media rants read like a manifesto for the CHOP zone, which was recently captured and controlled by similar ‘protestors’ in Seattle. However, inexplicably, Whitmer is blaming President Trump, spreading the same tired old falsehoods that democrats are desperate to make the American people believe. Breitbart News reported: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) claimed Thursday that President Donald Trump is “complicit” in stoking extremists like the ones who had planned an alleged plot to kidnap her and overthrow the state’s government. Whitmer’s remarks came in a livestreamed address in which she noted President Trump’s remarks on white supremacy during the first presidential debate. When asked to denounce the group Proud Boys, President Trump said, “Stand back and stand by.” Whitmer believes that was a “rallying cry” for those who allegedly sought to abduct her. “Just last week, the president of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacist and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups,” Whitmer said. “Hate groups heard the president’s words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry, as a call to action. “When our leaders speak, their words matter,” Whitmer continued. “They carry weight. When our leaders meet with, encourage, or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions and they are complicit.” [Like when Obama met with Black Lives Matter in the White House? Or how not one single democrat will call out Antifa?] #BREAKING: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer slams Trump in response to kidnapping plot: “‘Stand back and stand by.’ Hate groups heard the President’s words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry. As a call to action.” pic.twitter.com/c0U5HdAh1T — The Hill (@thehill) October 8, 2020 Whitmer took jabs at Trump repeatedly, claiming that he is “stoking distrust” and “fomenting anger.” “Our head of state has spent the past seven months denying science, ignoring his own health experts, stoking distrust, fomenting anger, and giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division,” Whitmer stated. While it is reported that twelve individuals have been charged in regards to the alleged kidnap plot, the United States attorneys in Michigan announced charges against Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. “When I put my hand on the Bible and took the oath of office 22 months ago, I knew this job would be hard. But I’ll be honest, I never could’ve imagined anything like this,” Whitmer said. NBC News added: Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller called Whitmer’s comments on Thursday “shameful.” “I mean, if we want to talk about hatred, then Gov. Whitmer, go look in the mirror — the fact that she wakes up every day with such hatred in her heart for President Trump — President Trump is the one out there condemning these radical groups, whether they be on the left or the right,” Miller said on Fox News. Trump on Thursday night attacked Whitmer, tweeting that the governor “has done a terrible job” and “locked down” her state, referring to coronavirus restrictions. “My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement” announced the foiling of a dangerous plot, he tweeted. “Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist,” Trump wrote. “I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence. Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President!” he added in another tweet. Governor Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her husband’s boating activities. The Federal Government provided tremendous help to the Great People of Michigan. My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement announced… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2020 …today that they foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan. Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2020 …I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence. Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President! Governor Whitmer—open up your state, open up your schools, and open up your churches! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2020 President Trump is correct. The ringleader of the gang of anarchists made no secret about his hate of President Trump… which seems to be on par with Whitmer’s own.

Dem Senate Candidate Upends Race As Scandalous Affair Includes Mocking Husband’s Suicide Threat,8 OCT 2020,4544,"In North Carolina, the Senate race has been rocked by a scandalous affair conducted by the democrat candidate. And recent revelations show that he mocked his mistress’s husband… who happens to be a veteran… for his suicide threats. The National File reported: Democrat North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Cal Cunningham’s affair with his mistress Arlene Guzman Todd drove Guzman Todd’s veteran husband to become suicidal, according to text messages obtained by NATIONAL FILE. In text messages, Arlene Guzman Todd tells her friend that her husband Jeremy Todd “was all suicidal and shit a couple of nights ago” and “Had a gun out.” Guzman Todd added, “I could not be bothered.” Guzman Todd then said that Cunningham mocked the potential suicide situation by telling her, “You’re going to be the best therapist ever at this rate. Sorry you’re having to deal with it.”   The Army Reserve is currently investigating officer Cunningham’s adultery, which could result in severe military punishment and even a year of “confinement” for Cunningham. Cunningham’s paramour Arlene Guzman Todd has been recently listed as media director of a marijuana public relations company and has been a California State University lecturer. Arlene Guzman Todd has also recently worked at the public relations firm RW Jones, which has clients including the University of Southern California and many public California universities. Arlene Guzman Todd’s husband Jeremy Todd has been an active duty servicemember. Jeremy Todd was an Army Sergeant First Class who served in the U.S. Army with five combat deployments including in Iraq and Afghanistan, then studied at the University of Southern California in a determined bid to support his young family. “My wife carried me through. She is really the superhero in all this. The wives are the unsung heroes of the military, the spouses that deal with everything. Without good wives and family, I don’t think soldiers would be successful in their missions and everything they do,” Jeremy Todd said of his military wife Arlene Guzman Todd. Guzman Todd has not returned requests for comment. Breitbart News reported on the impact this affair has had on the race: Democrat Cal Cunningham’s affair in North Carolina has upended the U.S. Senate race and may have far-reaching implications beyond his battle with Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC). On Wednesday, Cunningham dodged questions about the affair for which he is now under investigation by the U.S. Army Reserves.  CAL IS CAUGHT ON CAMERA by @MichaelWNCN Repeatedly refers questions to his communications team and refuses to answer specifics on his affair with the wife of a combat veteran or the ongoing US Army Reserve investigation announced this morning. #NCsen pic.twitter.com/ks18hTWA9D — Joanna Rodriguez (@joannamrod) October 7, 2020 That comes after revelations this week caused him to abandon a fundraiser and a town hall event, and just before scheduled fundraising events with national Democrat stars Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) set for Wednesday night. Booker and Duckworth have not returned requests for comment on what they think of the burgeoning scandal. Tuesday night, National File— which broke the original story of sexually explicit text messages between Cunningham and a mistress— published more texts between the mistress and a friend in which Cunningham’s mistress suggests she is in possession of nude photographs of the would-be Democrat Senator. The scandal has upended the race and roiled the highest levels of the Democrat Party in North Carolina and nationally, as even Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s PAC snubbed the one-time rising star Cunningham in a fundraising email sent out after the scandal broke by not including him in it. Despite the reports, Rachel Petri, Cunningham’s spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday the Democrat intends to move forward with his campaign. Petri said: Cal will participate in this process, but it does not change the stakes of this election or the need for new leaders who will fight for the issues North Carolinians care about instead of caving to the corporate special interests – which is exactly what Senator Tillis has done in his years in Washington. The Cunningham scandal could upend the North Carolina Senate race in favor of Tillis. Tillis represents a pivotal seat in the hotly contested fight for the control of the Senate majority. An East Carolina University (ECU) poll released in the days after the scandal first broke found that Tillis now leads Cunningham."
NY Times Calls For Open Sedition: Demands UN Interfere In US Election,8 OCT 2020,4323,"Many people wonder how the United States got to the point it is today… where Marxists run wild, rioting and looting, and the media cannot be trusted to report on something as basic as the President’s health accurately. Experts argue that the public school system has been developing communist sympathizers for the past few decades, and now those ‘woke,’ lost souls are deluded by the propaganda they imbibed. So much so that the New York Times has published an opinion piece that calls for open sedition. The National Pulse explained: The opinion editorial, entitled “America May Need International Intervention” was penned by Peter Beinart, also is a contributor at The Atlantic and Political Commentator for CNN. In over 1,000 words, Beinart makes the case for foreign election interference under the auspices of the notoriously globalist, anti-Trump United Nations, specifically the body’s Human Rights Council. The United Nations Human Rights Council, however, hosts egregious human rights abusers such as China, Somalia, Sudan, Venezuela, and Qatar. Despite this, Beinart tees up his piece insisting “even Democrats may find it hard to imagine, but the “leader of the free world” would benefit from United Nations oversight.” Beinart insists that Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden “should follow Sviatlana Tikhanovskaya’s example and appeal to the world for help.” He described Tikhanovskaya’s actions as “imploring the United Nations to act.” In a contested election in Belarus, Tikhanovskaya represents the globalist pick who lost to the duly-elected populist Alexander Lukashenko, a candidate that establishment forces have been attempting to undermine. Beinart continues, attempting to normalize America “requesting foreign intervention” in elections: “For many Americans — raised to see the United States as the natural leader of the “free world” — it may be hard to imagine requesting foreign intervention against tyranny in our own land. But as historians like Gerald Horne and Carol Anderson have detailed, there’s a long history of Black Americans doing exactly that.” He implores Democrats to bolster the actions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an international election advisory board which concluded American elections “contravene O.S.C.E. commitments and international standards with regard to universal and equal suffrage” in 2018. In addition to partnering with paragons of globalism – the United Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the World Bank – OSCE also has links to progressive megadonor George Soros. Soros was a keynote speaker at the opening session of an OSCE special meeting in 2003 and individuals from his foundation, the Open Society Institute, have advised the body. For example, George Sharvashidze, a former Director at the Open Society Institute spoke at an OSCE Economic Forum to promote collaboration with the institute’s academic fellowship program. And in 2012, the Open Society Institute advised the group on its “Human Dimension Implementation Meeting,” providing a comprehensive, nine-page brief on the issue. Beinart continues, insisting “Democrats should use the OSCE’s report as evidence in an appeal to the same body where Tikhanovskaya made hers: the U.N. Human Rights Council.” In other words, Beinart wants to cede America’s control over its own elections and give it to a body in which the Chinese Communist Party – identified as seeking a Biden victory – wields unparalleled power. Who’s to say the Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t manipulate the council the same way it did the World Health Organization, forcing a delay of life-saving information and continuing to withhold information about COVID-19. Beinart also pushes Democrats to “lodge a complaint with the Organization of American States, a regional organization that has pledged “to respond rapidly and collectively in defense of democracy.” China similarly sits on the group’s observer board, and the group itself was formed in Colombia. The Organization of American States also retains links to George Soros, as he lectured the group in 2006. The calls for foreign election interference emanating from the New York Times represent a complete reversal of the paper’s years-long crusade to tie President Trump to foreign collusion with Russia."
Stocks Roar After Trump Offers To Sign “Stand Alone” Stimulus For Americans Only,7 OCT 2020,3917,"Like a boss, President Donald Trump—in one fell swoop—outmaneuvered Nancy Pelosi and destroyed leftist-socialist dreams of wads of taxpayer money being funneled into failing democrat controlled states. The president tweeted that he is more than ready to sign a “stand alone” stimulus package that would put another $1200 into the pockets of American citizens. The Epoch Times reported: President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he would immediately sign a standalone bill providing $1,200 stimulus checks to Americans. “If I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY. I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” the president wrote on Twitter, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Trump issued the message hours after he ordered White House negotiators to cut off stimulus talks with the Democrats until after the election. The White House and Democrats have been negotiating for months to try to reach a compromise on a fresh stimulus bill. “We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “I am rejecting their request, and looking to the future of our Country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.” Pelosi said in response that walking away from negotiations “demonstrates that President Trump is unwilling to crush the virus, as is required by the Heroes Act.” “He shows his contempt for science, his disdain for our heroes—in health care, first responders, sanitation, transportation, food workers, teachers, teachers, teachers and others—and he refuses to put money in workers’ pockets, unless his name is printed on the check,” she added. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s primary negotiator, spoke for an hour over the phone on Monday morning and planned to speak again on Tuesday, a spokesman for the speaker said on Twitter previously. The House last week passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, an updated version of the Heroes Act, but the White House signaled it was opposed to the legislation. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has said that Trump won’t sign legislation that approaches a $2 trillion threshold. The government disbursed $300 billion in one-time checks to Americans as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act signed by Trump in March. The president has been supportive of a second round of checks for months. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused Pelosi of not being serious. “If she becomes serious, then we can have a discussion here,” McEnany told reporters in Washington. Trump’s decision to stop negotiations came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell called for another stimulus package, cautioning that without the stimulus, the economic recovery could be weak, “creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses.” If I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY.

Hollywood And Leftists Have Mental Breakdown Attacking Trump,6 OCT 2020,13900,"During the Great Depression, FDR told Americans the only thing they had to fear was fear itself… Now that President Trump has contracted and recovered from COVID-19, he has delivered a similar message. However, those words of encouragement have apparently driven already insane liberals even further from their grip on reality. The video posted by President Trump caused these high-profile leftists and many Hollywood entertainers (who are little more than trained monkeys there to amuse us for money) to go ballistic, attacking him and calling him “evil” for daring to say such things.

"Michigan Supreme Court Shuts Down Dem’s Illegal Restrictions, State AG Won’t Prosecute",5 OCT 2020,5916,"In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer outdid all other democrats with her arbitrary and totalitarian rule of the state, using COVID as the excuse to erase the individual liberties provided in the Constitution of the United States. People who wouldn’t submit to autocratic rule were threatened with criminal prosecution. However, the state’s Supreme Court shut down her drastic and illegal efforts to control the public using fear, so the state Attorney General has stated that she will not continue to enforce these executive orders, and Whitmer meanwhile, made the rounds on leftist news outlets whining about the triumph of the Republic. The Daily Caller reported: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Sunday she will not continue to enforce Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive orders “through criminal prosecution” after the state Supreme Court ruled the orders unconstitutional Friday. “In light of the Supreme Court’s decision on Friday, the Attorney General will no longer enforce the Governor’s Executive Orders through criminal prosecution,” read a statement from Nessel’s press secretary posted to Twitter on Sunday. “However, her decision is not binding on other law enforcement agencies or state departments with independent enforcement authority.” AG Press Secretary Issues Statement Regarding Michigan Supreme Court’s Recent Decision: pic.twitter.com/Wajzkuvr5I — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (@MIAttyGen) October 4, 2020 However, the statement also noted that Nessel’s “fervent hope” is that “people continue to abide by the measures that Governor Whitmer put in place – like wearing face masks, adhering to social distancing requirements and staying home when sick – since they’ve proven effective at saving lives.” The court issued a split decision Friday, ruling that Whitmer’s extension of emergency declarations used to mandate lockdown restrictions were unconstitutional, according to the Detroit Free Press. “Today’s Supreme Court ruling, handed down by a narrow majority of Republican justices, is deeply disappointing, and I vehemently disagree with the court’s interpretation of the Michigan Constitution,” Whitmer said in a statement Friday. “Right now, every state and the federal government have some form of declared emergency. With this decision, Michigan will become the sole outlier at a time when the Upper Peninsula is experiencing rates of COVID infection not seen in our state since April.” Whitmer said the ruling “does not take effect for at least 21 days” and that her “emergency declaration and orders retain the force of law.” Whitmer hinted that the same policies will last past the 21 days, saying “alternative sources of authority” will enforce her rulings. Whitmer locked down the state in March, shutting down barbershops, salons and other businesses deemed non-essential, prompting protests across the state. Conservative Treehouse explained the Supreme Court decision: The supreme court in Michigan has ruled that Governor Gretchen Whitmer exceeded her constitutional authority under state law in the arbitrary enforcement of her unilateral decrees to mitigate the COVID-19 virus. [pdf here] As the court wrote in the opinion rebuking the governor: “The people of this state have been denied a voice and a seat at the table in decisions that have impacted every facet of their lives and their futures over the past eight months. They deserve to have their representatives bring their voice and their concerns into this decision-making process.” At the heart of the governor’s legal argument was a 1945 law allowing the governor to declare a state of disaster or emergency if she finds one to exist and it remains in place for 28 days, unless the Legislature extends it. The legislature did not extend the declaration, yet the governor continued to restrict the citizens without any representative voice. MICHIGAN – […] In the 4-3 ruling, the court determined the governor did not have the authority under state law to issue any additional emergency declarations pertaining to the pandemic after April 30. That was the last date when the legislature allowed the governor to declare an emergency. “The governor’s declaration of a state of emergency or state of disaster may only endure for 28 days absent legislative approval of an extension. So, if the Legislature does nothing, as it did here, the governor is obligated to terminate the state of emergency or state of disaster after 28 days,” said the majority opinion, written by Judge Stephen Markman. […] “Put simply, and our criticism is not of the Governor in this regard but of the statute in dispute — almost certainly, no individual in the history of this state has ever been vested with as much concentrated and standardless power to regulate the lives of our people, free of the inconvenience of having to act in accord with other accountable branches of government and free of any need to subject her decisions to the ordinary interplay of our system of separated powers and checks and balances, with even the ending date of this exercise of power reposing exclusively in her own judgment and discretion,” the majority wrote. “It is in no way to diminish the present pandemic for this Court to assert, as we now do, that with respect to the most fundamental propositions of our system of constitutional governance, with respect to the public institutions that have most sustained our freedoms over the past 183 years, there must now be some rudimentary return to normalcy.”  (more) Here’s the full ruling: View this document on Scribd Watch her whining below: Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found CNN’s Jake Tapper fact-checks Michigan Gov.

Lawsuit Filed As Massive Ballot Harvest Fraud In Texas Exposed,5 OCT 2020,4536,"In Harris County Texas, it appears as if democrats are determined to steal the election at all costs. The Houston Courant reported: Harris County keeps finding itself in the news, but for all the wrong reasons. After county officials picked another fight with Texas law and Attorney General Paxton over mail-in ballots, and the Supreme Court of Texas stepping in to issue a stay, more bombshells have dropped. One is a lawsuit filed in Harris County that investigators have evidence of large scale organized ballot harvesting, going all the way to planning by the top party officials. This lawsuit is in response to the Harris County announcement that voters could begin hand-delivering absentee ballots for the presidential election to one of 11 annexes on Monday. The plaintiffs—the Harris County Republican Party and several individuals—allege this is all part of the mail in ballot push and harvesters intend to use the extra time to collect more fraudulent votes. And as if to underscore the importance of this issue, especially related to mail-in ballots, Gov. Abbott issued a proclamation enhancing ballot security protocols for the in-person delivery of marked mail ballots for the Nov. 3 election. Under this proclamation, beginning on Oct. 2, mail-in ballots that are delivered in person by voters who are eligible to vote by mail must be delivered to a single early voting clerk’s office location. If true, these new developments cast a different light on Harris County Clerk Chris Collins and County Judge Lina Hidalgo’s push for widespread sending of unsolicited mail-in ballots and extended voting. Both have bucked state rules and explicit guidance—including a letter as well as legal direction from the AG’s office regarding qualifications for mail-in ballots. In suggesting non-qualified Harris County voters can use a mail ballot, they are deliberately misleading people—despite repeated court rulings going as high as the Texas Supreme Court. The departure back in the spring of Collin’s predecessor, Diane Trautman, also takes on a new dimension based on the affidavits. This all adds up to something being rotten in the county of Harris, with apologies to Hamlet. Registered voters age 65 and up already received applications in July, and mail-in ballot are already in circulation as of Sept. 19. Collins has argued that the nature of the coronavirus pandemic means he must ensure voters who are sick can still vote. But repeated court rulings say that fear of catching COVID-19 doesn’t count as a disability or sickness by itself. In East Texas, four Gregg County commissioners  were indicted for 2018 ballot harvesting using just that technique. Throughout the nation, the rush to send mail-in ballots to voters who may not have requested them resulted in well over half a million voters having their ballots rejected in the 2020 presidential primaries. Evidence shows that voting by mail is more prone to error and harder to correct than voting in person. That’s to say nothing of the postal delays that can occur. All these factors, plus the concerns about ballot harvesting, add up to confusion and a loss of trust by the electorate in an especially contentious election year. And recently, as if in recognition of these issues, some left-leaning groups have suggested a shift to in-person voting. Inaccurate voter rolls and issues with registration of non-citizen voters (something raised this week in a lawsuit by the Public Interest Legal Foundation) mean that thousands of mail-in ballots could arrive in Harris County mailboxes with no corresponding voter in the home. People tend to move, and unfortunately also die, and those thousands of unclaimed ballots become a temptation to cheaters. Once ballot applications have been sent out, they can be easily intercepted and used by vote harvesters. This recipe for ballot fraud is far from fiction, with documented Harris county examples from as recently as 2018. Harris County should follow the law, and not disenfranchise its own voters by rushing to send out mail-in ballots universally. And officials should fully investigate the allegations of fraud being raised. The risk for a stolen election is too great. We know that tried-and-true methods of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic are working, and can be safely employed for the Nov. 3 election. Most importantly, as Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Justice James Ho wrote, “(the right to vote) won’t count if it’s cancelled by a fraudulent vote—as the Supreme Court has made clear in case after case.”"
Virginia Dems Force Christian Ministries To Accept Government Ideology Or Pay Massive $100K ‘Fine’,1 OCT 2020,10125,"In Virginia, where democrats control the state, the move to classify Christianity as an “extreme” and bigoted religion is underway. Two new laws have been passed that force ministries to adopt behaviors that are contrary to the faith, but acceptable to the left-wing mob. PJ Media reported: Three Christian schools and a Christian network of pregnancy centers are suing Attorney General Mark Herring (D-Va.) in order to prevent Virginia from implementing two pro-LGBT laws that force “people of faith to adopt a particular government ideology under threat of punishment.” The two laws purport to prevent “discrimination” against LGBT people but, in reality, they force Christian ministries to choose between violating their sincerely held religious beliefs, or paying hefty fines, as much as $100,000 per offense. The so-called Virginia Values Act (S.B. 868), which Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.) signed on Holy Saturday (the day before Easter Sunday) in the middle of a pandemic, compels churches, religious schools, and Christian ministries to hire employees who do not share their stated beliefs on marriage, sexuality, and gender identity. A companion law (H.B. 1429) requires ministries and others like them to pay for transgender surgery in employee health care plans, a procedure that violates these ministries’ convictions. “The faith of many Americans inspires them to act for the good of their neighbors and also requires them to abide by its teachings,” Denise Harle, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the law firm representing the Christian ministries, said in a statement. “Our clients offer spiritual guidance, education, pregnancy support, and athletic opportunities to their communities because of the religious beliefs that motivate them. But Virginia’s new law forces these ministries to abandon and adjust their convictions or pay crippling fines—in direct violation of the Virginia Constitution and other state laws.” “Such government hostility toward people of faith has no place in a free society,” Harle argued. The ministries filed a pre-enforcement challenge, a lawsuit designed to convince a court to prevent the government from implementing an unconstitutional law. In the lawsuit, ADF is representing Calvary Road Christian School in Alexandria (preschool through 6th grade, 250 students), Grace Christian School in Staunton (preschool through 12th grade, 320 students), Community Christian Academy in Charlottesville (K-9, 50 students), and Care Net, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that supports a network of 1,100 pregnancy centers, churches, and other ministry organizations and has approximately 22,000 volunteers. “For the Ministries, personnel is policy; and so they intentionally employ staff and recruit volunteers who further their respective Christian missions. Virginia’s new laws, however, make this free religious exercise and association impossible — and label these liberties ‘discrimination,’” the lawsuit argues. S.B. 868 and H.B. 1429 require the ministries to hire employees who disagree with their beliefs on marriage, sexuality, and gender; mandate that the ministries hire employees whose beliefs and lifestyles are “antagonistic to the ministries’ convictions”; prohibit the ministries from firing employees who oppose their missions; require the ministries to provide services in a manner that violates their beliefs; ban the ministries from even communicating their biblical beliefs; make the ministries use their facilities in a way that contradicts their beliefs; and force the ministries to pay for “gender reassignment” procedures in their health plans, even though the ministries object to these procedures. These laws put the ministries “in an impossible position: they must either abandon the religious convictions they were founded upon, or be ready to face investigations, an onerous administrative process, fines up to $100,000 for each violation, unlimited compensatory and punitive damages and attorney-fee awards, and court orders forcing them to engage in actions that would violate their consciences.” The lawsuit brings five claims against AG Herring. It claims the LGBT laws violate the ministries’ right of free exercise of religion under the Virginia Religious Freedom Restoration Act; violate their right to free exercise of religion under the Virginia Constitution; violate their right to free speech under the Virginia Constitution; violate the Virginia Constitution’s Establishment Clause; and violate the state constitution’s Due Process Clause. While the state constitution’s “Establishment Clause requires the government to act with a secular purpose and to neither promote nor inhibit religion,” the Virginia Values Act “targets the Ministries by singling out their religious speech and belief for hostility, and by showing favoritism towards, preferring, and promoting religious beliefs that approve of same-sex marriage and transgender ideology.” The pro-LGBT law “also singles out the Ministries based on disfavored religious views and sends a message that religious persons with beliefs like the Ministries’ are second-class citizens, outsiders, and not full members of the community.” The lawsuit notes that the Virginia legislators who supported the Virginia Values Act expressed hostility to those who view marriage as between one man and one woman. When considering SB 41 2016, a bill that would have allowed religious persons to object to solemnizing a marriage “in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief … that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman,” State Sen. Adam Ebbin (D-30) condemned the bill, claiming it “carves out a space for bigotry cloaked under the guise of religious freedom.” Ebbin was the chief patron of the Virginia Values Act in the Senate. During a debate in the Virginia House of Delegates over an amendment to the Virginia Values Act that would have excluded “a religious corporation, association, society, or unincorporated house of worship” from the definition of public accommodations, Delegate Joshua Cole (D-28) asserted his view of Christianity as the correct one in opposing the amendment: I understand we have theological disagreements and we have theological beliefs of what we’re supposed to carry out, but if you are a public organization, your doors are supposed to be open to everyone in the public. Now I don’t know what type of Christianity you come from, but the type of Christianity I come from, the Apostle Paul said “Try with everything within you to live peaceably with all men.” …The Bible also says “And they shall know us by our love.” What are we doing with our witness when we allow organizations to say just because we have St. Peter’s behind it, or Christian behind it, … that we don’t like you so don’t come over here…. Madame Speaker as an ending thought, I will let you know that in Jesus’ day the sinner was not his enemy. It was the church. These and other Virginia Democrats showed the very same kind of hostility to conservative religious beliefs about marriage that members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed toward Christian baker Jack Phillips, who refused to bake a cake celebrating a same-sex wedding. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the commission had violated Phillips’ right to the free exercise of religion by subjecting him to “religious hostility” in its application of the law. This hostility is not limited to the legislators, however. AG Herring has repeatedly insisted that if wedding photographers refuse to help celebrate same-sex weddings, they are discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Mark Herring said as much in amicus curiae briefs in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018) and in Telescope Media Group v. Lindsey (2019), two cases on the issue of whether or not bakers and photographers have the free speech and religious freedom right to refuse to serve same-sex weddings. Yet the ministries suing to stop the Virginia Values Act are not pushing bigotry — they merely intend to operate on the basis of their religious convictions. The lawsuit explains why each of the ministries cannot simply adopt the government ideology on LGBT issues. For example, Calvary Road Baptist Church, which operates Calvary Road Christian School, “believes that the Bible is the Word of God, divinely revealed and without error.” “Calvary Road believes that God wonderfully and immutably creates each person as male or female, and that these two distinct, complementary genders together reflect the image and nature of God. Calvary Road believes that rejection of one’s biological sex is a rejection of the image of God within that person,” the lawsuit explains. “Calvary Road believes that marriage has only one meaning: the uniting of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive union, as delineated in Scripture, and that God commands that sexual intimacy occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other.” “To preserve its function and integrity, Calvary Road believes that all employees and volunteers must agree to and abide by its beliefs on marriage, sexuality, and gender,” and the school runs athletics based on biological sex. “Calvary Road maintains separate facilities like bathrooms and locker rooms for males and females. Access to private facilities is limited to those of the same biological sex in accordance with Calvary Road’s teaching on sexuality.” “Calvary Road welcomes workers of any race, color, ethnicity, and national origin in any of its ministries, so long as the potential workers share Calvary Road’s religious values and doctrinal beliefs,” but it cannot employ those who disagree with its fundamental beliefs. ADF is also representing a wedding photographer, Chris Herring, who also brought a pre-enforcement challenge against the Virginia Values Act. Anti-religious bigotry seems on the rise, with Democrats adopting extreme pro-LGBT and pro-abortion policies and legacy media outlets reporting Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s mainstream Christian beliefs as some sort of extreme religious insanity."
Democrat Stimulus Bill Features Deportation Protection And Cash Payouts To Illegals,1 OCT 2020,2918,"Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are apparently determined to inject an infusion of voters into their dying base. So, within the next ‘pandemic’ stimulus bill, they’ve included cash payouts for illegals and protection from deportations. Fox News reported: A stimulus package proposed by Democrats in the House of Representatives includes a number of items that will benefit illegal immigrants — including an expansion of stimulus checks and protections from deportations for illegal immigrants in certain “essential” jobs. The $2.2 trillion bill includes language that allows some illegal immigrants — who are “engaged in essential critical infrastructure labor or services in the United States” —  to be placed into “a period of deferred action” and authorized to work if they meet certain conditions. It also grants protections to those employers who hire those undocumented immigrants, ordering that “the hiring, employment or continued employment” of the defined group is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That lasts until 90 days after the public health emergency is ended. A Democratic description of that part of the bill says that “such workers are deemed to be in a period of deferred action and to be authorized for employment, and employers are shielded from certain immigration-related violations for employing such workers.” It’s language that was included in the first House Democratic stimulus bill proposed back in May — a bill that was ultimately rejected in the Republican-controlled Senate. Also in the legislation is language that would allow the a second round of stimulus checks, $1,200 per adults and $500 per dependent, to be extended to those without a social security number — including those in the country illegally who file taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). The bill also would require the Department of Homeland Security to review the files of those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and to prioritize those for release if they are not a threat to national security. It also demands migrants have access to free video calls and access to virtual legal assistance from nonprofits. Those parts of the bill were criticized by immigration hawks like the Federation for American Immigration Reform. “Once again House Democrats are trying to bailout millions of illegal aliens – and not just financially, but give them de facto amnesty as well,” FAIR’s government relations director RJ Hauman told Fox News. “This would be an unprecedented move and take desperately needed money and jobs away from Americans in the middle of a pandemic. Even though it has absolutely zero chance of becoming law, I hope voters are paying close attention.” The House was expected to vote on the bill Wednesday evening, but it was later delayed to allow Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin another day to attempt to thrash out a deal."
Leftist Dark Money Funding “Carpet Bomb” In Battleground States,30 SEP 2020,4176,"Leftists are pouring money into the 2020 election as if their lives depend on it… because it does. Maintaining a foothold in the United States is crucial, but thanks to President Trump and the silent majority, they’ve been forced to go all out. With dark money, PACs are trying to influence most battleground states. Issues Insights explained: News broke recently of shadowy, left-wing nonprofit network Arabella Advisors’ plans to “carpet bomb” the 2020 election, per a new report detailing the $635 million in revenues the network boasted in 2018. But the presidential race isn’t the only focus of this merry band of barely visible left-wing funders. State races are also on the menu as part of Arabella’s plans to deploy “dark money” spending leftists once defined and then decried. From Wisconsin to North Carolina – and several states in between – Arabella’s network of some 340 pop-up nonprofits have been busy working to influence state elections even as one of the main nonprofits under the network’s umbrella, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, has given $27 million to pro-Biden affiliated PACs in an effort to boost the Democrats’ chances in the national contest. In fact, the profligate spending by left-leaning PACs at the state level has already seen success in Colorado and Arizona. Arabella’s added influence via what Capital Research Center president Scott Walter calls “phony groups” is intended to buttress that success. “Liberals are the loudest ‘dark money’ hawks in Congress and the media complaining about money influencing elections rarely seem to notice the scads of ‘dark money’ helping Democrats,” Walter recently said. He’s referring specifically to Arabella Advisors, which operates as a for-profit company based in Washington, D.C., and runs a nonprofit network that poured out hundreds of millions of dollars in 2018 with virtually no criticism from the money-in-politics crowd. Much of that money was spent on ads in key states using phony groups like Arizonans United for Health Care, Floridians for a Fair Shake, and North Carolinians for a Fair Economy. The left-leaning media writes regularly on the horrors of conservative “dark money,” yet managed to miss most of the Arabella story and has reported on just one part of the vast network. That’s a fairly amazing accomplishment given the plethora of state-based groups under the Arabella umbrella working to influence state races: Keep Iowa Healthy, Mainers Against Health Care Cuts, Kansans for Secure Elections, Health Care Voters of Nevada, Colorado United for Families, New Jersey for a Better Future, North Carolinians for Safe and Secure Elections, Ohioans for Economic Opportunity, PA Progress, Protect PA Voters, Secure Michigan Elections, SoCal Healthcare Coalition, and Speak Out Central New York. With all that influence peddling going around, mainstream media outlets must be nearly blind not to have seen at least some of it. Especially when Arabella-aligned groups such as Trusted Elections Fund are openly working on state-based efforts to address the run up to, and fallout of, elections. The Minneapolis Star Tribune – located in a city familiar with political battles, especially this past summer – reported that the Trusted Elections Fund was planning on raising “between $8 million and $10 million in case the pandemic leads to chaos in November . . . . The group is preparing for potential foreign hacking of state voting systems, ‘election day or post-election day violence,’ as well as contested results,” the paper noted, citing a two-page summary posted online. “Philanthropy has a responsibility to make sure that we are prepared for emergencies that could threaten our democracy,” the summary read. What’s becoming clearer is that while Arabella Advisors undoubtedly operates in the shadows with their hazy network of here-today-gone-tomorrow pop-ups and pass-through nonprofits, they have a great deal of help from a disinterested media as they cut their way through the national and state elections. With a more conservative president in the White House, the American system has gotten back to some of its roots and embraced federalism. So, too, have those attacking it."
COVID’s Fascist Rule Begins: Maryland Man Sentenced To One Year In Jail For Outdoor Parties,29 SEP 2020,1619,"In Maryland, as felons are released from prisons under the guise of ‘health’ safety, a man who threw two outdoor parties has been sentenced to a year in jail for breaking the COVID ‘emergency orders.’ He should have called them “protests.” Fox Baltimore reported: A Maryland man has been sentenced to a year behind bars after being found guilty of multiple counts of failure to comply with an emergency order. The Charles County Sheriff’s Office says 42-year-old Shawn Marshall Myers hosted a gathering of between 50 and 60 people on March 22 at his Hughesville home, in violation of Gov. Larry Hogan’s prohibition on large gatherings of people that was in effect at the time. “Myers was argumentative with officers but eventually agreed to disband his party,” according to the county State’s Attorney. Less than a week later, though, on March 27, officers responded to his home again for another report of a party exceeding 50 people. “Officers told Myers to disband the party, but again he was argumentative claiming he and his guests had the right to congregate,” the State’s Attorney says. “Beyond being argumentative, Myers directed his guests to stay in defiance of Governor Hogan’s Orders and the officers’ lawful orders to disband the party.” This time, he was arrested. On Friday, after a bench trial before District Court Judge W. Louis Hennessy, Myers was convicted of two counts of Failure to Comply with an Emergency Order and sentenced to a year of active incarceration to be served at the Charles County Detention Center. Upon release, Myers will be on unsupervised probation for a period of three years."
"Kentucky Felon Offers To Kill Cops For $30,000 Using Facebook Post",29 SEP 2020,1845,"As Facebook continues to silence conservative voices, people who want to kill police officers are apparently good to go. One man’s post offered to kill Louisville law enforcement officials for $30,000. However, thanks to that video, Kentucky officials have arrested the felon and charged him with new crimes. The Daily Caller reported: The Kentucky U.S. Attorney’s Office charged Louisville man Sunday after he allegedly asked for money in exchange for shooting police officers on Facebook Live. Cortez Lamont Edwards, 29, allegedly held an AR-style pistol and asked for $30,000 to gun down Louisville Metro Police Department officers — all of which was recorded live on social media, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. Edwards was arrested on his couch when authorities executed a search warrant Sunday, the DOJ wrote. “Louisville needs healing and safety for its citizens, not armed felons seeking bids to shoot police,” U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman said in the release. “Federal law enforcement here will continue to respond as one to swiftly mitigate threats to our city.” The 29-year-old was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and could be sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison, the release detailed. Authorities also recovered a 9mm Glock 19 handgun when they apprehended Edwards, and a toddler was near the man when officers entered the home, according to the DOJ. Feds charge armed felon threatening Louisville Police – https://t.co/evuStrg6xo — Eyewitness News (@WEHTWTVWlocal) September 27, 2020 Edwards’ case is being investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Louisville Metro Police Department, Homeland Security Investigations, the U.S. Marshal Service and the Secret Service, the release detailed."
Biden’s Texas Political Director Implicated In Massive Attempt To Rig Election,29 SEP 2020,7440,"According to testimony and video evidence, documentation and witnesses” to prove it, Joe Biden’s Texas Political Director is attempting to rig the election using mass mail-in ballots and an illegal ballot harvesting operation aimed at getting 700,000 ballots. AM Greatness reported: The investigators—a former FBI agent and former police officer—claim that Biden’s Texas Political Director Dallas Jones and his cohorts have been “hoarding mail-in and absentee ballots” and ordering operatives to them fill out for people in Harris County illegally, “including dead people, homeless people, and nursing home residents in the 2020 presidential election,”  Patrick Howley of the National File reported. While law enforcement agencies are reportedly investigating these potential crimes, nothing will be done about it until “well after the November 3, 2020 election” the former FBI agent said. Dallas Jones was appointed the Biden campaign’s Texas Political Director in late August. Congratulations to Dallas Jones, President and CEO of Elite Change, Inc., for being selected to serve as the Texas Political Director for the Biden Campaign! We look forward to helping Biden/Harris win Texas in November! #vote #BidenHarris2020 #BlueWave #TurnTexasBlue pic.twitter.com/Th8XIOaOiu — Elite Change, Inc. (@EliteChange) August 28, 2020 Mark A. Aguirre and Charles F. Marler provided sworn affidavits as part of a class-action lawsuit in the Texas Supreme Court, Steven Hotze, M.D. et al., against Harris County and the state of Texas. The National File obtained the private investigators’ affidavits. In his testimony, Aguirre stated that he is a retired captain with the Houston Police Department and now a private investigator. “I am currently involved in an investigation related to a wide-ranging and fraudulent ballot harvesting scheme in Harris County intended to rig the elections in the Houston/Harris County area. This scheme involves voter fraud on a massive scale,” he stated. Based on interviews, review of documents, and other information, Aguirre identified three individuals, including a state senator and the Harris County Commissioner, who are working with Jones on the ballot harvesting operation: “District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles, who is the handler of Mr. Jones, political consultant Gerald Womack, and Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis.” Aguire added: “One of the companies these individuals are using as a front for this operation is AB Canvassing, although there are others that have been identified that we are investigating.” Aguirre noted that the ballot harvesters have been exploiting the elderly with the complicity of nursing home staff. I have in my possession video-taped interviews of witnesses attesting to the aforementioned people having groups of people completing thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots, including completing ballots for deceased individuals; illegally going into nursing homes, with the complicity of the nursing home staff, and filling out and forging the signatures of nursing home residents; signing up homeless individuals to vote using the ballot harvester’s address then completing the ballot and forging the homeless individual’s signature. This entire operation is being run by the elite politicians of the Democrat Party in Houston/Hams County. FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT. Private investigator Charles F. Marler stated in his testimony that he formerly worked for the FBI where he was an Investigative Specialist “conducting undercover operations on espionage and terrorist targets.” Marler stated that former Harris County Clerk Diane Troutman was so concerned about being implicated in the fraud, she resigned earlier this year, citing “personal health reasons.” Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman Resigns due to personal reasons. pic.twitter.com/6zc0PZh4Pu — Harris County Clerk (@HarrisVotes) May 9, 2020 Marler stated that the harris County Commissioner “was not deterred and continued to move forward with the plan to mass mail ballots and expand the illegal ballot harvesting scam.” “In December of 2019, I was approached by two individuals who witnessed activity from an illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County. Since that date, I have been investigating the illegal ballot harvesting operation,” he testified. During my investigation, a core group of names continued to surface regarding the organization and operation of the voter fraud scheme. Witnesses have stated to me that Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles are leading the illegal ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas. Their chief lieutenants are Houston businessman Gerald Womack and political consultant Dallas Jones who work directly under them in executing the ballot harvesting operation in Harris County, Texas. Witnesses have shown me and described to me how the ballot harvesters take absentee ballots from the elderly in nursing homes, from the homeless, and from unsuspecting residences’ mailboxes. The ballot harvesters then complete the ballots for their preferred candidate and forge the signature of the “voter”. Two witnesses stated to me that there are two individuals employed at the Harris County Clerk’s Office who are aware of the illegal ballots and help facilitate and mask the processing of the ballots into the legal stream of ballots. I have been made aware of a law enforcement investigation in the Spring of 2020 regarding illegal ballot harvesting. Several interviews of individuals were conducted. After the interviews became public, former Harris County Clerk Diane Troutman, resigned alleging health concerns due to COVID-19. However, witnesses have told me that Ms. Troutman was arguing with Commission Rodney Ellis about the legality of the mass purchasing and mailing of mail-in ballots and that Troutman was concerned she would be included in the eventual arrest pertaining to illegal ballot harvesting. Instead of coming forward and exposing the scheme, Ms. Troutman abruptly resigned. Witnesses have stated that Commissioner Ellis was not deterred and continued to move forward with the plan to mass mail ballots and expand the illegal ballot harvesting scam. Another witness stated to me that an employee of Commission Ellis, Tyler James, has bragged that he could guarantee that the illegal ballot harvesting operation, with the help of mass mail-in ballots, could harvest 700,000 illegal ballots. It appears that law enforcement agencies are currently investigating these alleged crimes and I will provide them with the evidence that I have already collected and am continuing to collect. Sadly, these law enforcement agencies will be working to prosecute these crimes well after the November 3, 2020 election. Citizen journalist Colleen Vera had previously discovered evidence of what appears to be a massive vote harvesting ring operating in the state of Texas involving mail-in voting and various Democrat political campaigns. Vera’s evidence includes video of a Democrat campaign surrogate harvesting mail ballots from a nursing home during a 2018 primary race, and audio of a Democrat campaign worker admitting to harvesting ballots from a nursing home, and mail-in ballots from Harris County that all have the same handwriting and envelope process. According to the National File, the ongoing private investigation is working with law enforcement."
Texas Cities Told Not To Use Tap After Brain Eating Amoeba Discovered In Water Supply,28 SEP 2020,2302,"On Friday, residents in eight Texas cities were told not to use tap water for anything… other than flushing the toilet after authorities discovered a brain eating amoeba had infected the water supply. The Hill reported: The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued a “do not use water” advisory late Friday after officials were told about naegleria fowleri, a brain-eating amoeba in the water supply, according to a Friday statement issued by the commission. Lake Jackson, Freeport, Angleton, Brazoria, Richwood, Oyster Creek, Clute and Rosenberg, Texas, were all under orders not to use water. The Dow Chemical plant in Freeport and the Clemens and Wayne Scott Texas Department of Criminal Justice corrections facilities also received the order. The commission has since found that the water is safe in all of the locations except for Lake Jackson, according to a Saturday statement. Lake Jackson officials have issued a disaster declaration over the contamination. “Lake Jackson residents are still urged to follow the Do not Use Water Advisory until the water system has been adequately flushed and samples indicate that the water is safe to use. It is not known at this time how long this may take,” the commission said in a statement. Residents are “urged not to drink or use the tap water from the impacted system for any purpose,” including for bathing. Residents are permitted to flush toilets, according to the statements. They can also receive a free case of water from the city. The incident occurred on Sept. 8, when Lake Jackson city officials were informed of a 6-year-old boy who was hospitalized with the amoeba. The Texas Department of State Health Services later traced the infection to a water fountain “splash pad” the boy played in at the Lake Jackson Civic Center, CNN reported. The boy, Josiah McIntyre, died on Sept. 8 after fighting an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, ABC13 in Lake Jackson reported. He was honored on Saturday. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the amoeba is found in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers and hot springs as well as in soil. People cannot get infected by swallowing water contaminated with the amoeba, but infections are typically traced to water entering the body through the nose."
Elections Being “Stolen Outright”: Democrats Busted In Vote Harvesting Felony In Texas,28 SEP 2020,2553,"In Texas, where the state is fortunate to have a slim conservative majority, democrats who are working overtime to illegally fabricate and “harvest” votes have been charged for their crimes… but in other democrat controlled states, voter fraud (many experts warn) is running rampant. Fox News reported:     Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced four arrests Thursday on dozens of felony charges in connection with an alleged vote harvesting scheme during the 2018 Democratic primary elections in Gregg County. “It is an unfortunate reality that elections can be stolen outright by mail ballot fraud,” Paxton said in a statement. “Election fraud, particularly an organized mail ballot fraud scheme orchestrated by political operatives, is an affront to democracy and results in voter disenfranchisement and corruption at the highest level.” Gregg County Commissioner Shannon Brown, Marlena Jackson, Charlie Burns and DeWayne Ward face 134 felony charges in total, according to Paxton’s office. The allegations include election fraud, tampering with a governmental record, mail-in ballot fraud and more. “To increase the pool of ballots needed to swing the race in Brown’s favor, the group targeted young, able-bodied voters to cast ballots by mail by fraudulently claiming the voters were ‘disabled,’ in most cases without the voters’ knowledge or consent,” Paxton’s office alleged. Of the total charges, 97 felony counts were leveled against Jackson, 30 of them for alleged election fraud. Many of the charges accuse her of fraudulently marking applications for other people, claiming they were eligible for mail-in ballots due to disabilities when they were not disabled. Commissioner Brown faces 23 counts, and Burns and Ward face eight and six respectively. Penalties range from six months in jail to 99 years in prison. The primary race in question saw Brown beat a primary challenger by just five votes, 1,047 to 1,042, the Longview News-Journal reported – with 787 mail-in ballots cast. And Brown is Jackson’s husband, according to the outlet. “Those who try to manipulate the outcome of elections in Texas must be held accountable,” Paxton said. The arrests come weeks after Paxton sued in another county and warned them to stop sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to voters in a separate case. That lawsuit accuses Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins of violating state election laws by preparing to send more than 2 million applications to voters “who do not qualify and have not requested to vote by mail,” according to Paxton."
"Biden Refuses To Answer Question About SCOTUS, “Will Play President’s Game”",24 SEP 2020,2254,"Joe Biden can’t answer any serious questions, apparently… and most people believe that something will be contrived to ensure that he never, ever faces President Trump in a debate. When asked recently if he supported the democrat plan to pack the Supreme Court with activist liberals, Biden, yet again, refused to answer the simple yes or no. Breitbart News reported: Former Vice President Joe Biden continued to dodge questions about “packing” the Supreme Court again Wednesday, insisting that the question is a distraction — even though liberals are clamoring to expand the court to add left-wing justices. Democrats and liberal activist groups have been talking openly since 2019 about expanding the Court as the only feasible way to reverse its nominal 5-4 conservative majority in the near term. Pete Buttigieg, a former presidential candidate and a member of Biden’s prospective transition team, has proposed similar ideas; other Democrats have backed proposals to pack the Court if President Donald Trump dares to nominate a replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last week. Biden opposed the idea in 2019, but has shifted to the left on many issues, and is refusing to say what is position is now. Earlier this week, Biden called the question “legitimate” but refused to answer, saying that it was a way for President Trump to distract the public — as if Democrats had not brought up the idea themselves in direct response to Ginsburg’s passing. In an interview with WRAL in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden again dodged the question: “What I am going to say is that I urge the Democrats to go out and campaign like the devil to make it clear what the president has done, what he’s attempting to do — and he’s probably going to be able to do,” Biden adds. He says focus should be on threat to women’s health care. — Matt Viser (@mviser) September 23, 2020 “Will you go along with what some Democrats are proposing — to expand the court?” reporter Cullen Browder asked Biden. “What I’m not going to do — I hope you’ll understand — is play the president’s game … I’m not going to get into that,” he replied. Biden also continues to refuse to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. He has said he would choose a black woman."
COVID Survival Better Than Flu: Global Dissent Over Unnecessary “Emergency Polices” Grows,24 SEP 2020,32913,"To understand the real purpose of the COVID ‘pandemic’ measures, many people agree that you must understand how influential President Trump has been in halting evil global policies. The made-up “pandemic” is a ploy… and now a number of medical professionals and scientists are joining the fight against deadly “emergency policies” that are based on utter falsehoods. COVID 19 is less deadly than the common flu, according to new numbers from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). COVID 19 lockdown polices have NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE in reducing the spread, because contagion was another lie. https://twitter.com/Adam_Creighton/status/1308652790823051264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw A group of Belgian professionals have penned a letter to authorities and media, outlining the FACTS surrounding COVID, and explaining why these political reactions are more deadly than this flu. AIER reported: The following letter has made an impact on public health authorities not only in Belgium but around the world. The text could pertain to any case in which states locked down their citizens rather than allow people freedom and permit medical professionals to bear the primary job of disease mitigation. So far it has been signed by 394 medical doctors, 1,340 medically trained health professionals, and 8,897 citizens. * * * * * We, Belgian doctors and health professionals, wish to express our serious concern about the evolution of the situation in the recent months surrounding the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We call on politicians to be independently and critically informed in the decision-making process and in the compulsory implementation of corona-measures. We ask for an open debate, where all experts are represented without any form of censorship. After the initial panic surrounding covid-19, the objective facts now show a completely different picture – there is no medical justification for any emergency policy anymore. The current crisis management has become totally disproportionate and causes more damage than it does any good. We call for an end to all measures and ask for an immediate restoration of our normal democratic governance and legal structures and of all our civil liberties. ‘A cure must not be worse than the problem’ is a thesis that is more relevant than ever in the current situation. We note, however, that the collateral damage now being caused to the population will have a greater impact in the short and long term on all sections of the population than the number of people now being safeguarded from corona. In our opinion, the current corona measures and the strict penalties for non-compliance with them are contrary to the values formulated by the Belgian Supreme Health Council, which, until recently, as the health authority, has always ensured quality medicine in our country: “Science – Expertise – Quality – Impartiality – Independence – Transparency”. 1 We believe that the policy has introduced mandatory measures that are not sufficiently scientifically based, unilaterally directed, and that there is not enough space in the media for an open debate in which different views and opinions are heard. In addition, each municipality and province now has the authorisation to add its own measures, whether well-founded or not. Moreover, the strict repressive policy on corona strongly contrasts with the government’s minimal policy when it comes to disease prevention, strengthening our own immune system through a healthy lifestyle, optimal care with attention for the individual and investment in care personnel.2 The concept of health In 1948, the WHO defined health as follows: ‘Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or other physical impairment’.3 Health, therefore, is a broad concept that goes beyond the physical and also relates to the emotional and social well-being of the individual. Belgium also has a duty, from the point of view of subscribing to fundamental human rights, to include these human rights in its decision-making when it comes to measures taken in the context of public health. 4 The current global measures taken to combat SARS-CoV-2 violate to a large extent this view of health and human rights. Measures include compulsory wearing of a mask (also in open air and during sporting activities, and in some municipalities even when there are no other people in the vicinity), physical distancing, social isolation, compulsory quarantine for some groups and hygiene measures. The predicted pandemic with millions of deaths At the beginning of the pandemic, the measures were understandable and widely supported, even if there were differences in implementation in the countries around us. The WHO originally predicted a pandemic that would claim 3.4% victims, in other words millions of deaths, and a highly contagious virus for which no treatment or vaccine was available.  This would put unprecedented pressure on the intensive care units (ICUs) of our hospitals. This led to a global alarm situation, never seen in the history of mankind: “flatten the curve” was represented by a lockdown that shut down the entire society and economy and quarantined healthy people. Social distancing became the new normal in anticipation of a rescue vaccine. The facts about covid-19 Gradually, the alarm bell was sounded from many sources: the objective facts showed a completely different reality. 5 6 The course of covid-19 followed the course of a normal wave of infection similar to a flu season. As every year, we see a mix of flu viruses following the curve: first the rhinoviruses, then the influenza A and B viruses, followed by the coronaviruses. There is nothing different from what we normally see. The use of the non-specific PCR test, which produces many false positives, showed an exponential picture.  This test was rushed through with an emergency procedure and was never seriously self-tested. The creator expressly warned that this test was intended for research and not for diagnostics.7 The PCR test works with cycles of amplification of genetic material – a piece of genome is amplified each time. Any contamination (e.g. other viruses, debris from old virus genomes) can possibly result in false positives.8 The test does not measure how many viruses are present in the sample. A real viral infection means a massive presence of viruses, the so-called virus load. If someone tests positive, this does not mean that that person is actually clinically infected, is ill or is going to become ill. Koch’s postulate was not fulfilled (“The pure agent found in a patient with complaints can provoke the same complaints in a healthy person”). Since a positive PCR test does not automatically indicate active infection or infectivity, this does not justify the social measures taken, which are based solely on these tests. 9 10 Lockdown. If we compare the waves of infection in countries with strict lockdown policies to countries that did not impose lockdowns (Sweden, Iceland …), we see similar curves.  So there is no link between the imposed lockdown and the course of the infection. Lockdown has not led to a lower mortality rate. If we look at the date of application of the imposed lockdowns we see that the lockdowns were set after the peak was already over and the number of cases decreasing. The drop was therefore not the result of the taken measures. 11 As every year, it seems that climatic conditions (weather, temperature and humidity) and growing immunity are more likely to reduce the wave of infection. Our immune system For thousands of years, the human body has been exposed daily to moisture and droplets containing infectious microorganisms (viruses, bacteria and fungi). The penetration of these microorganisms is prevented by an advanced defence mechanism – the immune system. A strong immune system relies on normal daily exposure to these microbial influences. Overly hygienic measures have a detrimental effect on our immunity. 12 13 Only people with a weak or faulty immune system should be protected by extensive hygiene or social distancing. Influenza will re-emerge in the autumn (in combination with covid-19) and a possible decrease in natural resilience may lead to further casualties. Our immune system consists of two parts: a congenital, non-specific immune system and an adaptive immune system. The non-specific immune system forms a first barrier: skin, saliva, gastric juice, intestinal mucus, vibratory hair cells, commensal flora, … and prevents the attachment of micro-organisms to tissue. If they do attach, macrophages can cause the microorganisms to be encapsulated and destroyed. The adaptive immune system consists of mucosal immunity (IgA antibodies, mainly produced by cells in the intestines and lung epithelium), cellular immunity (T-cell activation), which can be generated in contact with foreign substances or microorganisms, and humoral immunity (IgM and IgG antibodies produced by the B cells). Recent research shows that both systems are highly entangled. It appears that most people already have a congenital or general immunity to e.g. influenza and other viruses. This is confirmed by the findings on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which was quarantined because of a few passengers who died of Covid-19. Most of the passengers were elderly and were in an ideal situation of transmission on the ship. However, 75% did not appear to be infected. So even in this high-risk group, the majority are resistant to the virus. A study in the journal Cell shows that most people neutralise the coronavirus by mucosal (IgA) and cellular immunity (T-cells), while experiencing few or no symptoms 14. Researchers found up to 60% SARS-Cov-2 reactivity with CD4+T cells in a non-infected population, suggesting cross-reactivity with other cold (corona) viruses.15 Most people therefore already have a congenital or cross-immunity because they were already in contact with variants of the same virus. The antibody formation (IgM and IgG) by B-cells only occupies a relatively small part of our immune system. This may explain why, with an antibody percentage of 5-10%, there may be a group immunity anyway. The efficacy of vaccines is assessed precisely on the basis of whether or not we have these antibodies. This is a misrepresentation. Most people who test positive (PCR) have no complaints. Their immune system is strong enough. Strengthening natural immunity is a much more logical approach. Prevention is an important, insufficiently highlighted pillar: healthy, full-fledged nutrition, exercise in fresh air, without a mask, stress reduction and nourishing emotional and social contacts. Consequences of social isolation on physical and mental health Social isolation and economic damage led to an increase in depression, anxiety, suicides, intra-family violence and child abuse.16 Studies have shown that the more social and emotional commitments people have, the more resistant they are to viruses. It is much more likely that isolation and quarantine have fatal consequences. 17 The isolation measures have also led to physical inactivity in many older people due to their being forced to stay indoors. However, sufficient exercise has a positive effect on cognitive functioning, reducing depressive complaints and anxiety and improving physical health, energy levels, well-being and, in general, quality of life.18 Fear, persistent stress and loneliness induced by social distancing have a proven negative influence on psychological and general health. 19 A highly contagious virus with millions of deaths without any treatment? Mortality turned out to be many times lower than expected and close to that of a normal seasonal flu (0.2%).20 The number of registered corona deaths therefore still seems to be overestimated. There is a difference between death by corona and death with corona. Humans are often carriers of multiple viruses and potentially pathogenic bacteria at the same time. Taking into account the fact that most people who developed serious symptoms suffered from additional pathology, one cannot simply conclude that the corona-infection was the cause of death. This was mostly not taken into account in the statistics. The most vulnerable groups can be clearly identified. The vast majority of deceased patients were 80 years of age or older. The majority (70%) of the deceased, younger than 70 years, had an underlying disorder, such as cardiovascular suffering, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease or obesity. The vast majority of infected persons (>98%) did not or hardly became ill or recovered spontaneously. Meanwhile, there is an affordable, safe and efficient therapy available for those who do show severe symptoms of disease in the form of HCQ (hydroxychloroquine), zinc and AZT (azithromycin). Rapidly applied this therapy leads to recovery and often prevents hospitalisation. Hardly anyone has to die now. This effective therapy has been confirmed by the clinical experience of colleagues in the field with impressive results. This contrasts sharply with the theoretical criticism (insufficient substantiation by double-blind studies) which in some countries (e.g. the Netherlands) has even led to a ban on this therapy. A meta-analysis in The Lancet, which could not demonstrate an effect of HCQ, was withdrawn. The primary data sources used proved to be unreliable and 2 out of 3 authors were in conflict of interest. However, most of the guidelines based on this study remained unchanged … 48 49 We have serious questions about this state of affairs. In the US, a group of doctors in the field, who see patients on a daily basis, united in “America’s Frontline Doctors” and gave a press conference which has been watched millions of times.21 51 French Prof Didier Raoult of the Institut d’Infectiologie de Marseille (IHU) also presented this promising combination therapy as early as April. Dutch GP Rob Elens, who cured many patients in his practice with HCQ and zinc, called on colleagues in a petition for freedom of therapy.22 The definitive evidence comes from the epidemiological follow-up in Switzerland: mortality rates compared with and without this therapy.23 From the distressing media images of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) where people were suffocating and given artificial respiration in agony, we now know that this was caused by an exaggerated immune response with intravascular coagulation in the pulmonary blood vessels. The administration of blood thinners and dexamethasone and the avoidance of artificial ventilation, which was found to cause additional damage to lung tissue, means that this dreaded complication, too, is virtually not fatal anymore. 47 It is therefore not a killer virus, but a well-treatable condition. Propagation  Spreading occurs by drip infection (only for patients who cough or sneeze) and aerosols in closed, unventilated rooms. Contamination is therefore not possible in the open air. Contact tracing and epidemiological studies show that healthy people (or positively tested asymptomatic carriers) are virtually unable to transmit the virus. Healthy people therefore do not put each other at risk. 24 25 Transfer via objects (e.g. money, shopping or shopping trolleys) has not been scientifically proven.26 27 28 All this seriously calls into question the whole policy of social distancing and compulsory mouth masks for healthy people – there is no scientific basis for this. Masks Oral masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. 29 30 31 Wearing a mask is not without side effects. 32 33 Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask.34 Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. 35 Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards. 36 A second corona wave? A second wave is now being discussed in Belgium, with a further tightening of the measures as a result. However, closer examination of Sciensano’s figures (latest report of 3 September 2020)37 shows that, although there has been an increase in the number of infections since mid-July, there was no increase in hospital admissions or deaths at that time. It is therefore not a second wave of corona, but a so-called “case chemistry” due to an increased number of tests. 50 The number of hospital admissions or deaths showed a shortlasting minimal increase in recent weeks, but in interpreting it, we must take into account the recent heatwave. In addition, the vast majority of the victims are still in the population group >75 years. This indicates that the proportion of the measures taken in relation to the working population and young people is disproportionate to the intended objectives. The vast majority of the positively tested “infected” persons are in the age group of the active population, which does not develop any or merely limited symptoms, due to a well-functioning immune system. So nothing has changed – the peak is over. Strengthening a prevention policy  The corona measures form a striking contrast to the minimal policy pursued by the government until now, when it comes to well-founded measures with proven health benefits such as the sugar tax, the ban on (e-)cigarettes and making healthy food, exercise and social support networks financially attractive and widely accessible. It is a missed opportunity for a better prevention policy that could have brought about a change in mentality in all sections of the population with clear results in terms of public health. At present, only 3% of the health care budget goes to prevention. 2 The Hippocratic Oath As a doctor, we took the Hippocratic Oath: “I will above all care for my patients, promote their health and alleviate their suffering”.
“I will inform my patients correctly.”
“Even under pressure, I will not use my medical knowledge for practices that are against humanity.” The current measures force us to act against this oath. Other health professionals have a similar code. The ‘primum non nocere’, which every doctor and health professional assumes, is also undermined by the current measures and by the prospect of the possible introduction of a generalised vaccine, which is not subject to extensive prior testing. Vaccine Survey studies on influenza vaccinations show that in 10 years we have only succeeded three times in developing a vaccine with an efficiency rate of more than 50%. Vaccinating our elderly appears to be inefficient. Over 75 years of age, the efficacy is almost non-existent.38 Due to the continuous natural mutation of viruses, as we also see every year in the case of the influenza virus, a vaccine is at most a temporary solution, which requires new vaccines each time afterwards. An untested vaccine, which is implemented by emergency procedure and for which the manufacturers have already obtained legal immunity from possible harm, raises serious questions. 39 40 We do not wish to use our patients as guinea pigs. On a global scale, 700 000 cases of damage or death are expected as a result of the vaccine.41 If 95% of people experience Covid-19 virtually symptom-free, the risk of exposure to an untested vaccine is irresponsible. The role of the media and the official communication plan Over the past few months, newspaper, radio and TV makers seemed to stand almost uncritically behind the panel of experts and the government, there, where it is precisely the press that should be critical and prevent one-sided governmental communication. This has led to a public communication in our news media, that was more like propaganda than objective reporting. In our opinion, it is the task of journalism to bring news as objectively and neutrally as possible, aimed at finding the truth and critically controlling power, with dissenting experts also being given a forum in which to express themselves. This view is supported by the journalistic codes of ethics.42 The official story that a lockdown was necessary, that this was the only possible solution, and that everyone stood behind this lockdown, made it difficult for people with a different view, as well as experts, to express a different opinion. Alternative opinions were ignored or ridiculed. We have not seen open debates in the media, where different views could be expressed. We were also surprised by the many videos and articles by many scientific experts and authorities, which were and are still being removed from social media. We feel that this does not fit in with a free, democratic constitutional state, all the more so as it leads to tunnel vision. This policy also has a paralysing effect and feeds fear and concern in society. In this context, we reject the intention of censorship of dissidents in the European Union! 43 The way in which Covid-19 has been portrayed by politicians and the media has not done the situation any good either. War terms were popular and warlike language was not lacking. There has often been mention of a ‘war’ with an ‘invisible enemy’ who has to be ‘defeated’. The use in the media of phrases such as ‘care heroes in the front line’ and ‘corona victims’ has further fuelled fear, as has the idea that we are globally dealing with a ‘killer virus’. The relentless bombardment with figures, that were unleashed on the population day after day, hour after hour, without interpreting those figures, without comparing them to flu deaths in other years, without comparing them to deaths from other causes, has induced a real psychosis of fear in the population. This is not information, this is manipulation. We deplore the role of the WHO in this, which has called for the infodemic (i.e. all divergent opinions from the official discourse, including by experts with different views) to be silenced by an unprecedented media censorship.43 44 We urgently call on the media to take their responsibilities here! We demand an open debate in which all experts are heard. Emergency law versus Human Rights The general principle of good governance calls for the proportionality of government decisions to be weighed up in the light of the Higher Legal Standards: any interference by government must comply with the fundamental rights as protected in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Interference by public authorities is only permitted in crisis situations. In other words, discretionary decisions must be proportionate to an absolute necessity. The measures currently taken concern interference in the exercise of, among other things, the right to respect of private and family life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and association, the right to education, etc., and must therefore comply with fundamental rights as protected by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). For example, in accordance with Article 8(2) of the ECHR, interference with the right to private and family life is permissible only if the measures are necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the economic well-being of the country, the protection of public order and the prevention of criminal offences, the protection of health or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the regulatory text on which the interference is based must be sufficiently clear, foreseeable and proportionate to the objectives pursued.45 The predicted pandemic of millions of deaths seemed to respond to these crisis conditions, leading to the establishment of an emergency government. Now that the objective facts show something completely different, the condition of inability to act otherwise (no time to evaluate thoroughly if there is an emergency) is no longer in place. Covid-19 is not a cold virus, but a well treatable condition with a mortality rate comparable to the seasonal flu. In other words, there is no longer an insurmountable obstacle to public health. There is no state of emergency. Immense damage caused by the current policies An open discussion on corona measures means that, in addition to the years of life gained by corona patients, we must also take into account other factors affecting the health of the entire population. These include damage in the psychosocial domain (increase in depression, anxiety, suicides, intra-family violence and child abuse)16 and economic damage. If we take this collateral damage into account, the current policy is out of all proportion, the proverbial use of a sledgehammer to crack a nut. We find it shocking that the government is invoking health as a reason for the emergency law. As doctors and health professionals, in the face of a virus which, in terms of its harmfulness, mortality and transmissibility, approaches the seasonal influenza, we can only reject these extremely disproportionate measures. Distribution of this letter We would like to make a public appeal to our professional associations and fellow carers to give their opinion on the current measures. We draw attention to and call for an open discussion in which carers can and dare to speak out. With this open letter, we send out the signal that progress on the same footing does more harm than good, and call on politicians to inform themselves independently and critically about the available evidence – including that from experts with different views, as long as it is based on sound science – when rolling out a policy, with the aim of promoting optimum health. PJ Media also reported on new information from the UK: When President Trump advocated reopening the economy, he warned that the lockdowns might have more of an adverse impact than COVID-19. Some assumed he was only talking about the economic implications but he also noted the risk of drug overdoses and suicides. We have seen increases in both of those types of deaths, along with significant mental health impacts. However, the tragedy of extended lockdowns is compounded by people not seeking medical care. The United Kingdom is noting this trend in raw numbers. From The Telegraph: Unexplained deaths in private homes are nearly nine times higher than those from Covid-19 amid fears that many people are still not accessing life-saving medical treatment. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that there were 830 excess deaths at home in the week ending September 4 compared to the five-year average. In contrast, just 99 people died with coronavirus mentioned on the death certificate in the same period. Only seven of those died at home. The figures also show that there were 371 fewer deaths in hospitals, suggesting hundreds of people who would normally have been taken in for treatment had died at home instead. Even accounting for that number, it still means there are around 450 excess deaths a week at home, from unknown causes, of people who may not ordinarily have died. Recent studies have shown that many people did not seek help for serious conditions, such as heart attacks, in recent months. The article warns of the risks associated with the first lockdown, now that Europe may be experiencing a resurgence of cases. In the last eight weeks, 1,117 death registrations listed COVID-19 as a cause. Excess deaths at home were 5,556, leading some medical experts to warn the COVID-19 response is now more deadly than the virus. As of April, 87% of cancer surgeons in the U.K. had stopped or reduced the number of procedures they were doing. Experts have estimated this could lead to an increase of 20% in cancer deaths. Because of the socialized system, the backlog is immense, and the results may get worse. The article notes that surgeons would have to work at 160% of their capacity to clear the backlog. While no one has compared excess deaths at home in the United States recently, we know that emergency room visits for acute issues such as strokes and heart attacks were down 42% from March 31 through April 27. In the full ten weeks following the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency, visits were still down for life-threatening conditions: Someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds, or nearly 790,000 per year. Likewise, strokes affect approximately 795,000 people, and there are 34 million Americans with diabetes. Yet as of September 11, we know four in ten adults, often those with preexisting conditions, avoided medical care: Studies have also shown cancer screenings are down, which may lead to an increase in deaths where timely screening would have saved a life: According to the Prevent Cancer Foundation, 35 percent of Americans had a cancer screening scheduled during the pandemic and missed it. Similarly, a survey this summer by the medical technology company Hologic found more than a quarter of women plan to either skip or delay their annual screenings this year. That includes mammograms, which can help catch breast cancer early when it’s easier to treat. As a result, the National Cancer Institute estimates that there could be 10,000 additional breast and colorectal deaths over the next decade as a result of missed screenings and delayed diagnoses, and health experts are raising concerns. Now we have some insight into the death rates by age throughout the pandemic from the CDC. Phil Kerpen from American Commitment was kind enough to calculate them by age. He also noted that these calculations are based on early experience in Europe, and survival rates have been improving: CDC estimated survival rates by age:
0 to 19: 99.997%
20 to 49: 99.98%
50 to 69: 99.5%
70+: 94.6% https://t.co/9UrhHFqVhM — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) September 22, 2020 As a reminder, the infection fatality rate (IFR) for the seasonal flu, according to the World Health Organization, is 0.1%. For ages birth to 49, the COVID-19 IFR is lower than for the seasonal flu. This fact needs to start guiding public policy nationwide immediately, especially regarding school openings, where the average age of teachers is 41. Clearly, those most at risk are over 70, and we know that these deaths generally include those with preexisting conditions. As of June, almost half of all deaths from COVID-19 had occurred in nursing homes. A study published in 2010 showed that the median length of stay in a nursing home before death was five months. Sixty-five percent passed away within one year. As has been noted previously, it is very likely that those who died in nursing homes would have died in the near term. This factor is why the excess deaths for the year matter. Yet, much younger, healthier people are at risk due to lower levels of preventative care, screenings, and even delays in treating chronic conditions and diagnosed cancers. One CDC analysis showed shocking decreases in the number of heart catheterizations done during the pandemic, meaning there are significantly more people with severe artery blockages walking around. An interactive graph from the Heritage Foundation also shows 1.6% of counties in the United States have experienced nearly 50% of the deaths. Yet in vast swaths of the country, draconian measures remain. Children are still home, and college students are subjected to meaningless testing. (Heritage Foundation) Yelp says 60% of closures on their platform are permanent, yet Democrats in Congress refuse to vote on a narrow relief bill. If the goal is to save “just one life” as Governor Andrew Cuomo famously said, public policy needs to be reevaluated now. Because it is becoming clear that the years of life lost to the lockdown will far exceed the years of life lost to COVID-19. And this is the measure all public policy should be based on."
Life During War Time For All… Expect For Virus Epicenter Where Masks Are Mysteriously Missing,23 SEP 2020,2671,"In the epicenter of the Wuhan virus outbreaks, the threat of infection is apparently over. Disco dancers were photographed without masks… leaving many people wondering why the rest of the world remains under the iron fist of “public health” controls. The New York Post reported: No panic at this disco. Revelers are flocking back to Wuhan clubs amid reports that the former epicenter of the pandemic hasn’t recorded a home-grown coronavirus case since May. Photos taken on Friday, Sept. 18 show partygoers crammed elbow-to-elbow on a dance floor at an unnamed disco in the Hubei capital, reported Vice. Many aren’t wearing masks despite the fact that most Chinese clubs post placards telling patrons to do so. The brazen displays come after Wuhan — where the outbreak originated — was deemed COVID-free after officials tested 9.9 million people. The central Chinese city has not reported a locally transmitted case since mid-May, over a month after it lifted a 76-day lockdown that halted the movement of Wuhan’s 11 million residents. Along with businesses and factories, restaurants, cinemas and karaoke lounges have also reopened to pre-pandemic capacities, Bloomberg reported. To prevent a second wave, China has rolled out a contact tracing system that requires citizens to present a health code before entering a club. Despite the stringent measures, the rapid reopening efforts may have made people complacent. “Some residents have dropped their guard and don’t wear masks when they go on the streets,” Luo Ping, an epidemic control official in Wuhan, told CCTV in April. Meanwhile, disturbing photos from August show hundreds of maskless revelers packed together in a Wuhan waterpark. However, Chinese State media have argued that events are a “sign of the city’s return to normalcy.” Here’s hoping the recklessness doesn’t cause a resurgence in the former COVID ground zero, where infections totaled over 50,000 this past winter, reported CNN. Wuhan also reported 2,500 deaths, accounting for 77% of all coronavirus fatalities across China. “The reopening of Wuhan does not mean the all-clear, neither does it mean a relaxing of epidemic prevention and control measures (within the city),” said Luo. Fortunately, China’s daily coronavirus cases have dwindled significantly for over a month, according to state reports — although some have accused the government of covering up the real COVID figures in the past. In the United States, related deaths are nearing 200,000 thanks to liberal democrats who bussed infected people to nursing homes, despite having room in hospitals. However, actual COVID 19 deaths are recorded at less than 10,000 according to the CDC."
"Dems “War” Plan Revealed, They’ll “Blow Up The Senate,” Remake US In Their Image",21 SEP 2020,5767,"With the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Rosh Hashanah, democrats were catapulted into a night mare of epic proportions. The news caused them to completely throw off all restraint (although they were already near that with the COVID fakery and riots they’ve orchestrated), and threaten American citizens with dire consequences if President Trump and the Senate perform their constitutional duty and confirm a new Supreme Court Justice. Forgetting their words in 2016, and Ginsburg’s own comments about such a replacement at such a time, the left has promised severe retribution if the laws of the land are carried out… because they apparently hate and despise the law and want to rewrite it to favor their socialist slave-state. Fox News reported: Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso called on President Trump and his Senate colleagues to summarily move forward on a nominee to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, warning that whether or not they do so, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and his Democratic caucus will “blow up the Senate” if they take power in 2021. The senator also said that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s, D-N.Y., presence at a Schumer press conference earlier in the day is more proof she is the “de facto speaker of the House” and is a sign of what is to come in the Democratic Party. “We’re here to protect the rights of women — their rights to their body, to choose, their rights to health care and equality would go down the drain if that wish were not realized,” Schumer said. “A court with a kind of nominee President Trump will choose will undo all of that and not make global warming less likely but more likely and it will come quicker… We do not want to turn the clock back. And we only need two more senators who will abide by RGB’s wish. Two said it. We need two more.” [This is not true. Women are not protected by laws that allow biological men to compete in their sports… and murdering an unborn child has nothing to do with “health care.”] Barrasso, R-Wyo., noted on “Fox News @ Night” that when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., balked at scheduling a hearing for President Obama’s 2016 SCOTUS nominee, D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick B. Garland, it was on account of “the Biden Rule.” In 1992, the current Democratic presidential nominee was a U.S. senator from Delaware, who took to the floor and made a speech calling on the legislative body not to hold any potential hearings for nominees offered by then-President George H.W. Bush. McConnell wrote in a Friday letter that the Biden rule has no effect on a situation wherein both the presidency and the Senate are of the same party. He highlighted how, in 1888, Democratic President Grover Cleveland was the last commander in chief to nominate a jurist during a state of divided government in an election year. On the “Fox News @ Night” special, Barrasso said that if the Democrats held both the presidency and the Senate, they would not be circumspect and instead rush forward through the nomination process. “The one question Senator [Benjamin] Cardin[, D-Md.,] wouldn’t answer [in the previous block] was what’s Chuck Schumer going to do. Let me be clear – he continued – if the Democrats win the White House and the Senate and have the House, they will change the rules and they will blow up the Senate.” “They have an entire war room working on this and they will expand the number of members of Supreme Court regardless of what the Republicans and President Trump do,” the Wyoming Republican added. Schumer said during a Democratic caucus call that “nothing is off the table for next year” if the GOP moves forward with a nominee, a source on the call told Fox News. To that extent, Barrasso said that Democrats hope to also give the District of Columbia statehood, all but guaranteeing two new Democratic senators — which he referred to as “stack[ing] the Senate.” During the prior interview, Cardin noted, however, that the last time a Supreme Court vacancy occurred this close to a presidential election was 156 years ago. That year, Chief Justice Roger Taney of Maryland –­­ who led the court during the infamous Dred Scott decision –­­ died with 27 days to go before President Lincoln’s reelection bid in 1864. Lincoln, once having won reelection, nominated his former Treasury secretary, ex-Sen. Salmon P. Chase, R-Ohio, who was confirmed as the next chief justice. Axios took the time to outline the “war” plan threatened by the left”: Furious Democrats are considering total war — profound changes to two branches of government, and even adding stars to the flag — if Republicans jam through a Supreme Court nominee then lose control of the Senate. On the table: Adding Supreme Court justices … eliminating the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to end filibusters … and statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico. “If he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021,” Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) tweeted. …  On ABC’s “This Week,” George Stephanopoulos asked Speaker Pelosi about the possibility of impeaching President Trump or Attorney General Barr as a way to stall a Supreme Court confirmation in a post-election lame-duck session. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on a call with his caucus yesterday, after a moment of silence for Justice Ginsburg: Let’s unpack what that means: … P.S. Brian Fallon — executive director of the progressive group Demand Justice and a former top Schumer aide and Justice Department official — distilled the Democratic game plan: Via Twitter Others point out that that is EXACTLY what the GOP should do… now: Otherwise, look for complete slavery if democrats ever take control of the legislature and presidency again. https://twitter.com/RepJoeKennedy/status/1307298448530706433"
Los Angles Forbids Jews To Celebrate High Holy Days,18 SEP 2020,2472,"According to a law firm specializing in religious freedom, Los Angeles has indirectly prohibited Jewish families from observing the High Holy days, which begin today. CBS reported: In the initial Sept. 2 order, before the wording was revised, an example given by officials for prohibited gatherings included “having dinner with extended family and friends to honor the High Holidays (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur),” according to First Liberty Institute. The county later revised the health officer order on Sept. 13 to prohibit “having a meal with extended family and friends for a religious or cultural holiday,” omitting the specific reference to the Jewish holidays. Considered the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, Rosh Hashanah begins Friday and Yom Kippur starts on Sept. 27 and ends the following evening. “Although now hiding behind obscured language, the ban on celebrating the High Holidays with others remains,” wrote Stephanie Taub, senior counsel with First Liberty, which is based in Plano, Texas. A letter signed by Taub and sent Wednesday to Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis and County Counsel Mary Wickham alleges the “county’s policy threatens enforcement against the upcoming holiday of a religious minority faith” even while the county “has not vigorously policed its stated ban on small gatherings with friends or extended family.” The letter was also delivered to U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s office. In response, a Los Angeles County spokesperson told City News Service the county recognizes that religious services “are central to many of our residents’ lives, especially in these trying times, and religious services have been allowed to be held online and outdoors with physical distancing and the use of face coverings, and they may continue to be held with those public health safeguards in place.” Rabbi Yisrael Gelb, executive director of Augudath Israel of California, called the county’s protocol involving small gatherings “profoundly disrespectful and disappointing.” “I plan on honoring the High Holidays as I do every year, by sharing a table with a local family in my congregation,” Gelb said. “We urge the county to reverse its policy and allow us to celebrate our most holy days in peace and safety.” Given that more and more evidence shows that COVID is not as fatal, nor as infectious as the left would like Americans to believe, these continued violations of constitutional rights must end, experts agree."
DOE Sec. Threatens To Deny Federal Funding Based On “Racism” Admission,18 SEP 2020,10178,"To collect federal funds, groups and organizations must legally swear to abide by laws preventing ‘racism,’ and ‘systematic racism’ within its policies. So, when Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber bowed to the Marxist movement and ‘confessed’ that the school was part of “institutional racism,” the Department of Education called his bluff. Admitting “racism” like this means no more federal money… and the school might have to pay back the funds it’s collected for the past few years as well. PJ Media explained: Early this month, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber went through the woke “anti-racist” rite of confession: he published a letter confessing the ongoing racism at his university under his leadership. Such confessions serve to prop up the ridiculous claim that any racial disparities are ipso facto proof of “institutional racism.” Claims like Eisgruber’s are less a confession of actual fact and more a rhetorical weapon to push Marxist critical race theory. Yet the Department of Education (DOE) decided to call Princeton’s bluff. According to a letter obtained by The Washington Examiner, the DOE launched an investigation into the Ivy League university. Princeton, like other schools that receive federal funding, pledges to abide by certain federal laws in order to receive federal funding. Since Eisgruber became president in 2013, Princeton has received more than $75 million in federal Title IV taxpayer funds and the school “has repeatedly represented and warranted to the U.S. Department of Education Princeton’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” the letter reads. “Title VI provides no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” “On September 2, 2020, you admitted Princeton’s educational program is and for decades has been racist,” the letter notes. “Among other things, you said ‘[r]acism and the damage it does to people of color persist at Princeton …’ and ‘[r]acist assumptions…remain embedded in structures of the University itself.’” “Because of racism, you announced race-based ‘diversity’ measures for hiring, procurement, teaching, fellowship, and research funding,” the letter adds. “Based on its admitted racism, the U.S. Department of Education is concerned Princeton’s nondiscrimination and equal opportunity assurances in its Program Participation Agreements from at least 2013 to the present may have been false,” the letter explains. “Finally, the Department is further concerned Princeton’s many nondiscrimination and equal opportunity claims to students, parents, and consumers in the market for education certificates may have been false, misleading, and actionable substantial misrepresentations in violation of” U.S. law. Therefore, the DOE is opening an investigation into Princeton and may end up removing funds from the university — and demanding Princeton pay back taxpayer funds it should not have received. “Based on the facts, the Secretary of Education may consider measures against Princeton for false Program Participation Agreement nondiscrimination assurances, including an action to recover funds.” The Princeton president’s statement Taken at face value, Eisgruber’s statement does justify a DOE investigation. The university president did indeed confess to propping up “anti-Black racism,” but he clearly did so as a rhetorical weapon. By confessing to institutional racism at Princeton, Eisgruber can then claim that American society as a whole is institutionally racist. Referring to the perceived police abuse of force in the cases of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and Jacob Blake, the Princeton president wrote, “This outrageous and awful violence has revealed yet again, and with searing intensity, the long, painful, and ongoing existence of anti-Black racism in America. Racial justice demands the scholarly and practical attention of this University.” “We must ask how Princeton can address systemic racism in the world, and we must also ask how to address it within our own community,” Eisgruber wrote. “That is true even though, for at least the past fifty years, this University has committed itself to becoming more inclusive. At a University that, for most of its history, intentionally and systematically excluded people of color, women, Jews, and other minorities, Princetonians— from the oldest alumni to the newest undergraduates — now take pride in the diversity of our community.” “Racism and the damage it does to people of color nevertheless persist at Princeton as in our society, sometimes by conscious intention but more often through unexamined assumptions and stereotypes, ignorance or insensitivity, and the systemic legacy of past decisions and policies.  Race-based inequities in America’s health care, policing, education, and employment systems affect profoundly the lives of our staff, students, and faculty of color,” the president argued. “Racist assumptions from the past also remain embedded in structures of the University itself,” he confessed. “For example, Princeton inherits from earlier generations at least nine departments and programs organized around European languages and culture, but only a single, relatively small program in African studies.” Eisgruber seized on a supposed racial inequality in Princeton’s departments, overlooking the history of the Western heritage and the basic fact that so many aspects of modern human flourishing — science, free markets, limited government, and universities themselves — did develop in European societies. This is not to say institutions like Princeton should not study African, Asian, North and South American, and other cultures, as well. But Eisgruber engaged in needless self-flagellation, suggesting that studying Western heritage more than other cultures is somehow racist.  “Anti-racism” Yet this kind of thinking falls in line with the “anti-racist” movement. In his book Stamped From the Beginning, scholar Ibram X. Kendi explains the basic logic of “anti-racism”: People of all races are inherently equal, but some races have more money/prominence than others, therefore the society must be racist. Kendi attacks two different groups of people: outright racists and “assimilationists.” He argues that most Americans still harbor racist ideas, and he claims that any explanation for racial disparities besides “structural racism” is inherently racist because it blames the victim. America’s long and successful struggle to ban outright racial discrimination in the law does not matter to the “anti-racist” movement. It does not matter that black people tend to dominate sports like basketball and football due to their individual training and success. It does not matter that a wide variety of factors explains why police tend to regard young black men with more suspicion, most notably crime rates. Black people are more likely to face stigma and they are more likely to be seen as representatives of the black community, rather than being seen as individuals. This is a double-edged sword: it means black people are unjustly regarded with suspicion but it also means that there is a bias in favor of black people in some schools, jobs, and professions. Yet reformers have worked hard to excise racial discrimination from American law. Attorney General Bill Barr recently explained why he believes there is no such thing as “systemic racism.” “To me the word ‘systemic’ means that it’s built into the institution and I don’t think that’s true,” the AG said. “I think our institutions have been reformed in the past 60 years, and if anything is built-in, it’s a bias to nondiscrimination and safeguards against [racism.]” Eisgruber did not intend to confess to violating federal discrimination law. He meant to signal his virtue and convince people that America is institutionally racist in order to further his own political and ideological goals. That makes the Department of Education’s response brilliant — perhaps even hilarious. Accusations and confessions of racism are serious, or at least, they used to be. Thanks to the logic of “anti-racism,” a completely colorblind policy — one that judges people not “by the color of their skin but by the content of their character,” in Martin Luther King Jr.’s words — would still be considered “racist” because the free actions of free individuals result in racially disproportionate outcomes. Federal law rightly prohibits many kinds of racial discrimination, but it prohibits discrimination on an individual level. Federal law does not require schools like Princeton to admit exactly 73.09 percent white students, 16.42 Asian students, and 5.78 percent black students, so that the student body represents the population of Princeton, N.J. In fact, by these measures, Princeton University is “racist” in favor of black people (9 percent of the undergraduate population) and Asians (25 percent of undergraduates, even higher percentages in post-grad classes). The “anti-racist” measurement is actually more racist. The government arguably has a role in preventing racial discrimination when it comes to opportunities, but it has no business ensuring exact racial representation in outcomes. That would be absurd. If America adopts the “anti-racist” definition of “racism,” the government cannot prevent racial discrimination when it comes to opportunities and individuals. At that point, preventing racial discrimination must mean achieving proportionate outcomes. This broader definition of racism justifies both brainwashing and an unguided, destructive revolution. Riots across America have arguably oppressed black people far more than the U.S. supposedly does. The riots have destroyed black lives, black livelihoods, and black monuments. At least 26 Americans have died in the riots, most of them black. The Department of Education was right to call Princeton’s bluff here. Words have meaning, and the “anti-racist” revolution must be stopped. Princeton Letter 09.15.2020 by TJVD"
Emails Show Nashville Mayor’s Office Deliberately Hid COVID ‘Cluster’ Facts From Public,17 SEP 2020,3142,"In Nashville, a democrat enclave along with Memphis within the state, the liberal controlled Mayor’s office apparently worked to deliberately keep people unemployed by hiding real COVID facts. Fox 17 reported: Emails between the mayor’s senior advisor and the health department reveal only a partial picture. But what they reveal is disturbing. The discussion involves the low number of coronavirus cases emerging from bars and restaurants and how to handle that. And most disturbingly, how to keep it from the public. On June 30th, contact tracing was given a small view of coronavirus clusters. Construction and nursing homes were found to be causing problems with more than a thousand cases traced to each category, but bars and restaurants reported just 22 cases. Leslie Waller from the health department asks, “This isn’t going to be publicly released, right? Just info for Mayor’s Office?” “Correct, not for public consumption,” writes senior advisor Benjamin Eagles. A month later, the health department was asked point blank about the rumor there are only 80 cases traced to bars and restaurants. Reporter Nate Rau asks, “The figure you gave of ‘more than 80’ does lead to a natural question: If there have been over 20,000 positive cases of COVID-19 in Davidson and only 80 or so are traced to restaurants and bars, doesn’t that mean restaurants and bars aren’t a very big problem?” Health department official Brian Todd asked five health department officials, “Please advise how you recommend I respond. ” The name at the top of the response is clipped off but you may find the answer unacceptable. “My two cents. We have certainly refused to give counts per bar because those numbers are low per site. We could still release the total though, and then a response to the over 80 could be because that number is increasing all the time and we don’t want to say a specific number.” Neither the health department nor the mayor’s office would confirm the authenticity of the emails but councilmember Steve Glover had a Metro staff attorney inquire. Here’s the official answer: “I was able to get verification from the Mayor’s Office and the Department of Health that these emails are real,” the staff attorney answered. Glover says this is Metro Nashville orchestrating a cover up. “They are fabricating information,” Glover said. “They’ve blown there entire credibility Dennis. Its gone, I don’t trust a thing they say going forward …nothing.” Glover says he has been contacted by an endless stream of downtown bartenders, waitresses and restaurant owners asking why would officials not release these numbers? “We raised taxes 34 percent and put hundreds literally thousands of people out of work that are now worried about losing their homes, their apartments…and we did it on bogus data. That should be illegal,” Glover said. Again, FOX 17 News wasn’t told by the mayor’s office this wasn’t true. We were told to file a freedom of information act request. Which allows us now to ask the question, why are you keeping this from us? Why would you even want to? It’s just the real numbers and what could possibly be an honorable motive?"
"Facebook Banned This Ad For “Missing Context,” Watch It Here",17 SEP 2020,4834,"On Tuesday, Facebook banned a political ad that contained factual information about Joe Biden’s policies, claiming that ad was “missing context.” PJ Media reported: On Tuesday, Facebook flagged an ad attacking Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) for supporting a bill that would undermine fairness in women’s sports by allowing biological males who identify as transgender to compete in women’s events. Citing PolitiFact, Facebook claimed that the ad “is missing context and could mislead people.” PolitiFact did not claim that the ad was false, but it reframed the issue in defense of the bill. “Today, Facebook caved to a pressure campaign by far-left activists, effectively censoring our effort to inform voters about Democrat threats to women’s athletics,” American Principles Project (APP) PAC Director Terry Schilling wrote in a statement. “Our ad campaign makes a very simple claim: policies supported by Joe Biden, Sen. Gary Peters and other Democrats would destroy girls’ sports. There is ample evidence for this claim and more coming in every day. Nothing in the PolitiFact review shows this claim to be false,” Schilling explained. “Yet Facebook has nevertheless decided to declare that our ad might ‘mislead people’ because it is ‘missing context.’ Apparently, they believe the ad will only be fair if we also include the leftist ‘arguments’ against us.” “Do we now need pre-approval from Democrats before we run ads critical of their policies? This is an absurd standard — one which Facebook obviously doesn’t hold the other side to,” the APP director concluded. APP shared the flag with PJ Media. “A Post Shared by Your Page Is Missing Context,” the notice reads. “Independent fact-checkers at PolitiFact say that information in a post shared by American Principles Project is missing context and could mislead people. We’ve added a notice to the post.” “All female athletes want is a fair shot at competition: at a scholarship, at a title, at victory,” the ad begins. “But what if that shot was taken away by a competitor who claims to be a girl but was born a boy? Senator Gary Peters and Joe Biden support legislation that would destroy girls’ sports. They call it equality. Really? That’s not fair. Not fair at all,” the voiceover reads as videos show teenage girls running a race and losing to a boy. “Vote against Gary Peters and Joe Biden. They are too extreme for Michigan,” the ad concludes. This ad echoes longstanding complaints about the dangers of allowing biological males who claim to be transgender to compete against biological females in women’s sports. In February, three high school girls and their mothers filed a Title IX lawsuit against the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC), challenging pro-transgender rules that allow biological males to compete in women’s high school sports. The three girls have lost multiple state championships to biological boys who identify as female. “While boys and girls have comparable athletic capabilities before boys hit puberty, male puberty quickly increases the levels of circulating testosterone in healthy teen and adult males to levels ten to twenty times higher than the levels that occur in healthy adult females, and this natural flood of testosterone drives a wide range of physiological changes that give males a powerful physiological athletic advantage over females,” the lawsuit explains. “Inescapable biological facts of the human species [are] not stereotypes, ‘social constructs,’ or relicts of past discrimination.” The suit lists 8 broad physiological athletic advantages males enjoy over girls and women after the onset of puberty, including larger lungs, larger hearts, an increased number of muscle fibers and muscle mass, higher myoglobin within muscle fibers (enabling faster transfer of oxygen to those muscles), larger and longer bones, increased mineral density in bones, and height. Due to these long recognized advantages, sporting events have long had different standards for boys and girls to accommodate the athletic striving of biological females. For example, women’s volleyball nets are 7 inches lower, the weight of high school shot put for boys is 36 percent heavier, the hurdle is 6 inches higher for boys, etc. Even the Journal of Medical Ethics, which has published an article calling for Child Protective Services to remove gender-confused kids from their parents if the parents won’t give them experimental transgender drugs, also published an article condemning the “intolerable unfairness” of the Olympic Committee’s pro-transgender rules. Yet Democrats like Biden and Peters have endorsed the Equality Act, a pro-transgender measure that would open women’s sports to biological males, without any provisions to mitigate the clear physical advantages males have over females."
Teen Working For GOP Congressional Campaign Gunned Down In Minnesota,17 SEP 2020,1910,"Republican candidate Lacy Johnson is running against Ilhan Omar in Minnesota. On Monday, a teen campaign aide working as an outreach coordinator was murdered outside a gas station in Minneapolis. Another campaign worker was shot, but is expected to survive the attack. Powerline Blog reported: Last night, two of his campaign volunteers were shot in North Minneapolis. The local CBS outlet has the story: The 17-year-old boy killed and another man hurt Monday in a north Minneapolis shooting were members of a Republican congressional candidate’s campaign. The Lacy Johnson campaign says the two victims were members of the outreach team and were not performing campaign duties when the shooting occurred Monday afternoon at the intersection of North Fremont and Dowling avenues. Minneapolis police say a group of people were standing outside of a Super USA convenience store when one or more shooters opened fire. The teenager and the man were hit, and emergency crews brought them to Hennepin Healthcare for treatment. The teenager was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Investigators are still searching for the shooters, who fled the scene on foot. At this point, the shootings are not believed to have anything to do with the election. But they highlight the dangerous situation that has been unleashed by anti-law enforcement elements, primarily Black Lives Matter, in Minneapolis. Lacy Johnson commented appropriately: “It is shocking and unnecessary acts of violence like this that prove why change is more needed than ever in our community.” the Johnson campaign wrote, in a statement. The CBS story concludes: Minneapolis has experienced a surge in gun violence this summer. According to police, this year is on track to double 2019’s homicide total. One wonders whether Black Lives Matter and Antifa will ever be held accountable for the wave of violence they have encouraged and helped to unleash."
Pittsburgh Scientists Isolate Antibody That “Neutralizes” COVID,15 SEP 2020,2164,"If you are one of the millions of people who reject forced immunizations and think that RNA and DNA altering ‘vaccines’ developed by companies controlled by Bill Gates are sinister in the extreme, there is good news. Scientists have isolated an antibody, that has been used to make a drug, highly effecting for preventing and curing COVID infections. Fox News reported: Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have isolated “the smallest biological molecule” that “completely and specifically neutralizes” SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The antibody component is 10 times smaller than a full-sized antibody, and has been used to create the drug Ab8, shared in the report published by the researchers in the journal Cell on Monday. The drug is seen as a potential preventative against SARS-CoV-2. According to the report, the drug has been “highly effective in preventing and treating” the SARS-CoV-2 infections in mice and hamsters during tests. The drug also reportedly does not bind to human cells, which suggests it will not have negative side effects in people. “Ab8 not only has potential as therapy for COVID-19, but it also could be used to keep people from getting SARS-CoV-2 infections,” said co-author John Mellors, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Pitt and UPMC. “Antibodies of larger size have worked against other infectious diseases and have been well tolerated, giving us hope that it could be an effective treatment for patients with COVID-19 and for protection of those who have never had the infection and are not immune.” Xianglei Liu of Pitt is also co-lead author of the study. Researchers are “thinking outside the box” for how the drug could be administered, stating it may be able to be inhaled or through a superficial injection, instead of an IV. According to the report, the team at University of Texas Medical Branch Center for Biodefense and Emerging Diseases and Galveston National Laboratory tested Ab8 and found it blocked the virus from entering cells. In mice trials, those treated with Ab8 had 10-fold less of the amount of infectious virus compared to those that were untreated."
"HHS Spokesman Warns People To “Buy Ammo,” CDC Resistance “Haven” Is “Sedition”",15 SEP 2020,2230,"In a dire warning, Health and Human Services spokesman Michael Caputo is warning Americans to buy ammo (as if we already didn’t know we needed it and are finding it hard to get). The New York Post reported: The top spokesman at Health and Human Services accused scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of “sedition” for their response to the coronavirus pandemic and warned people to buy guns and ammo because an insurrection led by Democrats could start on Inauguration Day if President Trump refuses to “stand down,” according to a report Monday. Michael Caputo, who was appointed by the president to be the HHS spokesman in April, claimed without providing evidence that the CDC was creating a haven for a “resistance unit” working to undermine Trump, the New York Times reported. Caputo also said his life could be in danger. “You understand that they’re going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that’s where this is going,” he told his followers in a live video posted on his Facebook page Sunday. He also predicted that Trump will win re-election but Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, won’t concede. “And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin. The drills that you’ve seen are nothing,” he said, adding: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.” [It’s already nearly impossible for certain weapons.] “There are scientists who work for this government who do not want America to get well, not until after Joe Biden is president,” he continued. The department in a statement called Caputo a “critical, integral part of the president’s coronavirus response, leading on public messaging as Americans need public health information to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.” Caputo told the Times that he and his family have been “continually threatened” since joining the administration. “This weighs heavily on us, and we deeply appreciate the friendship and support of President Trump as we address these matters and keep our children safe,” he said. But he vowed to stay in his government post, saying, “I’m not going anywhere … I swear to God, as God is my witness, I am not stopping.”"
No “New Normal” For Individual Liberty! Judge Rules Dem ‘Restrictions’ Unconstitutional,15 SEP 2020,6863,"In a move that freedom-lovers are cheering, while democrats bemoan, a federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled that the Constitutional protections regarding individual liberty may not be set aside because of an ‘emergency.’ He said, “The Constitution cannot accept the concept of a ‘new normal’ where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended emergency mitigation measures.” The move essentially slapped down the dictatorial decisions to remove protected freedoms, issued by democrat governor Tom Wolf. https://twitter.com/TheSharpEdge1/status/1305563525528449025?s=03 WTAE reported: A federal judge in Pittsburgh says Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and State Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine had good intentions to protect people from the coronavirus but their orders went too far. The judge ruled in a court order that Wolf’s closing of “non-life-sustaining” businesses and restrictions on gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic were unconstitutional. “You can’t tell 13 million Pennsylvanians that they have to stay home. That’s not America. It never was. That order was horrible,” Thomas W. King, III, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told Pittsburgh’s Action News 4. Judge William Stickman IV ruled that the state-posed limits on gatherings violated the First Amendment and the stay-at-home and business-closing orders violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The ruling by Stickman was made in a case in which Butler, Greene, Fayette and Washington counties are listed as plaintiffs. The counties had filed suit, claiming the shutdown orders were unconstitutional. Stickman, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote in his ruling that the Wolf administration’s pandemic policies have been overreaching, arbitrary and violated citizens’ constitutional rights. Stickman ruled in favor of individual and business plaintiffs, and he dismissed the county governments from the case. Individuals who won the favorable ruling include U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa.; state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Butler; and various businesses including hair salons and the Starlight Drive-In. “This ruling stands for the proposition that even in a pandemic, the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania do not forfeit their constitutionally protected rights,” Thomas E. Breth, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told Pittsburgh’s Action News 4. The attorneys say their clients are still willing to voluntarily abide by health guidelines such as masks and social distancing. “The judge is saying if you own a business, the governor and the health secretary can’t shut it down,” King said. “That never again will Pennsylvanians under these circumstances be told to stay home, with fear of arrest or threats of loss of license. He’s also thrown out this nonsense that was the orders that had to do with life-sustaining or non-life-sustaining businesses, picking and choosing winners and losers.” Lyndsay Kensinger, the governor’s press secretary, says the Wolf administration is disappointed and will seek a stay of the decision and file an appeal. “The actions taken by the administration were mirrored by governors across the country and saved, and continue to save lives in the absence of federal action,” Kensinger said. “This decision is especially worrying as Pennsylvania and the rest of the country are likely to face a challenging time with the possible resurgence of COVID-19 and the flu in the fall and winter.” Kensinger said the court ruling is limited to the business closure order and the stay at home orders issued in March and were later suspended, as well as the indoor and outdoor gathering limitations. “This ruling does not impact any of the other mitigation orders currently in place including, but not limited to the targeted mitigation orders announced in July, mandatory telework, mandatory mask order, worker safety order, and the building safety order,” she said. Two Butler County Commissioners initiated the lawsuit, which was joined by other counties, individuals and businesses. “This by no means doesn’t recognize that we have a virus and a pandemic and that have a public health issue that needs to be addressed,” Leslie Osche, Butler County Commissioner and commission chair, told Pittsburgh’s Action News 4. “We need to be self accountable, to continue to wear masks and take the necessary precautions that we’ve already been taking to mitigate the pandemic, the virus,” said Butler County Commissioner Kimberly Geyer, who serves as vice-chair of the commission. “They’re still willing to abide by those guidelines. They still want people to be safe. They just want to be able to operate their businesses to make a living, go about their lives as they’re protected by the U.S. Constitution,” Breth said. The declaratory judgment says “(1) that the congregate gathering limits imposed by defendants’ mitigation orders violate the right of assembly enshrined in the First Amendment; (2) that the stay-at-home and business closure components of defendants’ orders violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) that the business closure components of defendants’ orders violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” In his written opinion, Stickman noted that the Wolf administration’s actions “were undertaken with the good intention of addressing a public health emergency,” but that “even in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered.” “The liberties protected by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms — in place when times are good but able to be cast aside in times of trouble,” Stickman wrote. “There is no question that this country has faced, and will face, emergencies of every sort. But the solution to a national crisis can never be permitted to supersede the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American experiment. The Constitution cannot accept the concept of a ‘new normal’ where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended emergency mitigation measures. “Rather, the Constitution sets certain lines that may not be crossed, even in an emergency. Actions taken by defendants crossed those lines. It is the duty of the court to declare those actions unconstitutional.” Wolf has since lifted many of the restrictions, allowing businesses to reopen and canceling a statewide stay-at-home order. While reopening its economy, Pennsylvania limited occupancy to 75% capacity at most businesses and 50% at theaters, gyms, salons and malls. It imposed even more restrictive measures on bars and restaurants, which the Wolf administration blamed for a summer spike in virus cases. The judge said the plaintiffs did not challenge Wolf’s occupancy limits, and his ruling does not impact those orders. Nor did the lawsuit challenge the Wolf administration’s order requiring people to wear masks in public."
"Senate GOP Silently Defies President Trump, Protects Deep State By Rejecting Appointments",14 SEP 2020,15935,"Making sure the ‘right’ people are put in place is key to maintaining political and financial control within the workings of the deep state… and Mitch McConnell knows just how to do it. McConnell speaks a good game on TV, but when the time comes for actual change… he blocks the president… and that’s exactly what he’s doing right now. Conservative Treehouse reported: The Decepticon snake rears its ugly head once again as a recent report indicates the Senate will not confirm President Trump’s nominees for Ambassador to Afghanistan and Germany.  Nothing within the Senate happens without Mitch McConnell directing it. According to sources cited by the Washington Free Beacon the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a hotbed for Decepticon payments by foreign governments, will not take up the nominations of retired U.S Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor (Germany) or U.S. Navy reserve officer William Ruger (Afghanistan) because they do not hold the correct and appropriate thinking of the republican controlled Senate. […] “The administration has sent the Senate three foreign policy nominees with no chance of clearing the Senate, which has to be some form of Guinness World Record for incompetent congressional relations,” said one senior GOP congressional official, citing opposition to Ruger, Macgregor, and Anthony Tata, who was recently tapped to become the Pentagon’s number two spot. (read more) This is not a surprise.  As CTH has noted since the republicans took control over the senate in 2014, the upper chamber is opposed to anything President Trump supports.  In the final analysis this is a large part of the reason why the republican led Senate Intel Committee was used as part of the usurpation effort. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is full of McConnell’s apparatchiks, and each carries an assignment to resist the Trump administration effort.  Control over the committee assignments is one way Mitch McConnell retains his grip on power and carries out the objectives of his allies on Wall Street and the administrative state.  We noted this power dynamic when McConnell assigned Mitt Romney to the committee. A predictable assignment for a Decepticon tool placed to protect the interests of the multinationals.  A committee position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ensures that Mittens can prosper from the indulgences of foreign lobbying efforts. This institutional behavior is very predictable; but first you have to admit the severity of the problem.  A reminder from two years ago: CTH JANUARY 2019 – […]  A pattern of political stories are beginning to show signs of a common continuity. In the bigger of the big pictures seven words continue to set the baseline: “There are trillions of dollars at stake”. When the common sense Tea Party movement formed in 2009 and 2010 it contained a monumentally frustrated grassroots electorate, and the scale of the movement caught the professional republican party off-guard. When Donald Trump ran for the office of the presidency he essentially did the same thing; he disrupted the apparatus of the professional republican party. The difference between those two examples is one was from the bottom up, and the second was from the top down. However, the commonality in the two forces resulted in the 2016 victory. It took a few years for the heavily armored old guard of GOP to formulate a plan to retain their control. In the example of the Tea Party, the republican power structures moved in 2011 through 2014 to co-opt the vulgarian movement and impede their disruptive influence. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was at the forefront of those power moves. {Go Deep} and {Go Deep} The basic issue for the GOP was retention of power. McConnell and crew tamped down the fire. A few years pass and the issues that spurred the Tea Party movement remained unresolved. In 2015 Donald Trump taps in to that exact same Tea Party frustration toward the control authority within one-half of the DC UniParty; again, the professional republican apparatus was disrupted. From the first moment candidate Trump announced his platform positions; from the very first poll *after* those platform positions were announced; Donald Trump was leading the republican field in every-single-poll from August of 2015 through today. Center stage throughout 2015 and 2016 and President of the United States as an outcome therein. Yes, the “movement” rebranded and now MAGA wins the presidency. So it should not come as a surprise to see an eerily similar response from within the GOP toward the new threat; the Trump presidency. There are two constants in an ever changing universe: (1) “NeverTrump” didn’t go away; and (2) the Bush-clan, or GOP old guard, will never accept losing power. The professional republicans and the professional democrats, ie. “the uniparty”, have a common enemy in President Trump. The vulgarian leader of the deplorable coalition never asked for permission; never paid the indulgency fees; never attended the necessary cloistered club meetings paying homage; and never offered the indulgent team of political elites terms for his takeover. Thus Donald Trump, just like the Tea Party, would never be accepted. Why is this important now? Current events highlight the resurgence of a never disassembled GOP Bush clan influence. For the past two years it’s been a never-ending game of whac-a-mole as each of the establishment minded embeds surfaces at different times. Within the dynamic, the one commonality within the internecine conflict inside the Trump administration is the establishment GOP -vs- Trump MAGA. Establishment GOP consultant Alex Castellanos was very open about the best design to getting rid of Donald Trump back in 2015 when he discussed an almost identical strategy for how Mitch McConnell destroyed the threat from the Tea Party a year earlier: […] “The best way to do it is how Brutus killed Caesar. Get real close, snuggle up, and shiv him in the ribs”… (link) Forgive me for mixing my metaphors here; but as each of the shiv-bearers appears, that’s when Trump is forced to deliver the whac-a-mole hammer. It’s like having an administration filled with establishment terror cells. Each cell acts independently, but each cell also acts based on a common objective: retain the UniParty. The earlier whac-a-mole example was Condi Rice’s embed plant and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson popping his head up. But there are many more examples all around in various forms; including the self-serving GOP exit of U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley; and now we see Mitt Romney. When you think about the actual structure of the Republican state party machines; it’s enough to make you wonder if the mid-term outcome and lack of structural fight was not part of this dynamic. After all, “their” party was taken over by a new MAGA base and a new pragmatic political leader, Donald Trump. The same UniParty dynamic is visible in the way the FBI/DOJ and aggregate intelligence community were weaponized against Donald Trump – with Democrats and Republicans participating in the unlawful processes. Now, in the downstream consequence phase, we see a UniParty defense approach to block Trump from revealing what happened. I’m not sure people fully completely understand this dynamic within “spygate”. It was not a targeting operation by democrats; republicans were just as complicit. The ongoing goal to eliminate candidate and president Trump is *not* partisan. Which brings me to the current state of the advisers around the executive. Remember, there are trillions at stake here – and the downstream benefactors are both Republicans and Democrats who make up the UniParty. Within the UniParty dynamic, in order to retain full financial benefit, the political class need to align with Wall Street priorities. That alignment means the UniParty needs to eliminate Main Street priorities that are adverse to their interests. Border controls and immigration enforcement are adverse interests to the UniParty. Additional cross party alignment to benefit Wall Street surrounds: •budgets and massive government spending; •government controlled healthcare retention; •government controlled education (common core); •and most importantly the removal of any national economic and trade policy that would threaten the structure of the multinationals. On all of these issues the Democrats and Republicans have identical outlooks, common interests and mirrored legislative priorities. It is not coincidental that US Chamber of Commerce President Tom Dohonue also outlined these issues as primary priorities for his massive lobbyist spending. There are trillions of dollars at stake; and we must never discount how far the Big Club participants will go to ensure the White House counselors are shaping their advice toward those objectives. There are no MAGA lobbying groups in Washington DC advocating for policies that benefit economic nationalism. On this objective President Donald Trump stands alone. We don’t need a third party in Washington DC, we actually need a second one. It cannot be overstated how violent and confrontational the House of Representatives will be as soon as they are sworn in.  They will work with an immediate purposeful intention. All political violence will be approved to attain their objectives.  The recent behavior of Jim Acosta (CNN media), and ANTIFA toward Tucker Carlson, is now, and will be going forward, the new normal. There will be extreme political violence. In 2006 it was the SEIU and AFSCME union foot-soldiers who smashed windows, advanced upon polling places and engaged in the most severe examples of voter fraud and intimidation.  In 2018, with the help of uber-Alinsky DNC Chairman Tom Perez, that corrupt sentiment is now institutionalized within democrat-socialist political apparatus.  ANTIFA is now the DNC grassroots activist approach. Failing to accept the severity of this shift in the past decade is intellectually dishonest.  As Nancy Pelosi said of the Occupy Wall Street violent anarchists: “God bless these people.”  Indeed the OWS precursor to ANTIFA were laying the groundwork for the new severity of power in Democrat leadership.  Nothing is out-of-bounds; no level of corrupt behavior will be avoided; everything will happen openly and without any backlash from a compliant media apparatus; the social fabric will be shredded. The Democrat mantra: “never let a crisis go to waste” is the modern version of the Fabian-Socialist: “remould it closer to the heart’s desire“.  Both approaches rely upon the destruction of acceptable norms in order to advance the political objective. ♦Specifics: When Democrats last took power in January 2007, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer took control in the final two years of George Bush second term.  Immediately they set about a process laying the groundwork for the 2008 presidential election of Barack Obama.  This was a priority objective. One of the techniques was the removal of the budget process. By eliminating the federal budget process in 2007 (fiscal year ’08) the Democrats paved the way for the next democrat president to demand massive open-ended spending. By the time the year of the general election came around (2008), the lengthy budget process was replaced with Omnibus spending bills (fiscal year 2009).  Obviously when Obama was successfully installed in November of 2008, the useful crisis was financial. The subsequent TARP bailout, auto bailout, ARRA ($1 trillion stimulus) and QE1 were all accomplished with massive omnibus spending packages. [NOTE: These are important references because from that moment forward, despite the GOP taking back control in January 2011, the constraining budgetary process was forever destroyed. There was never regular-order budgetary spending again.] It is also critical to emphasize the difference between Democrats taking control in the last two years of Bush’s second term, and Democrats taking control in the last two years of Trump’s first term.  Within this difference you will predictably see a shift in strategic operations from the Marxists. George W Bush was exiting, and unlimited spending was used to empower the entry of Obama; however, now the Marxists need to knee-cap President Trump by weaponizing the power of the purse – the biggest weapon of the House of Representatives. After a ten year UniParty hiatus the Marxists will now go back to using budgets in the structural defunding and dismantling of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the Southern Border Wall, and any program, initiative, policy or institution the Marxists want to see removed.   This is a strategy of the Democrat crisis-makers; and they are exceptionally better at achieving their desired results than Republicans. When it comes to political weaponization and political power constructs the Marxists have exceptional work ethics; they will outwork anyone on the other side who opposes them.  They are far, far, better at political strategy and scheme than conservative politicians.  Part of the reason for their success is that crooks, cons and swindlers are far more cunning than honorable, virtuous and moral people.  It is unfortunate, but true; and the same truth applies beyond politics. ♦ Two other thoughts on this issue.  First, you might remember when this massive spending, and the government takeover of healthcare, led to the Marxists losing the 2010 midterm election in a massive defeat.   But do you remember what the democrats did in the lame-duck congress between November 2010 and January 2011? Does the term “Porkulous” ring a bell? While 63 democrat seats were lost in the November 2010 election (and six democrat senate seats), those exiting Marxists, despite just having suffered the worst defeat in almost 100 years, audaciously –and apologetically– voted in the December 2010 lame-duck session, to fully fund President Obama’s next two years in office.  This was done by Speaker Nancy Pelosi specifically to block the incoming GOP wave from upending the priorities of the Obama administration in 2011.  That was called the “Porkulous” spending bill; and the democrat-marxists didn’t give a snit about how it looked. Now, did Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Leader Mitch McConnell do anything as bold to fund and secure the budgetary priorities of President Donald Trump in the 2018 lame-duck? No? Think about the overall unilateral commitment and cunning historically displayed by the Marxist wing of the UniParty. They are so committed to the long-term view they are willing to sacrifice anything for the biggest, most consequential, advances toward their objectives.  In 2010 the democrats killed their own “blue-dog” coalition to advance their ideological goals. Within the 63 House seats the Marxists lost in that 2010 midterm election; they killed off the entire 40 member Bart Stupak coalition; the blue-dog caucus.  Totally willing to sacrifice 40 seats to attain a generational ideological objective (ObamaCare); and they are about to step back into power a mere eight years later.  Stunning when you think about it. Few people have any idea just how bad these next two years are going to be. We are the normal people who don’t spend every moment of our day scheming, conniving, and developing plans to dismantle the lives of your freedom loving community and rebuild it as a collective society. For these political beneficiaries of Wall Street lobbying that’s all they do.   Every moment of their existence they spend thinking about how to gain power and dominate, 24/7/365  that is all they do. That is all the ever talk about; that is all they ever converse with each-other about.  Every second of every moment, in every meeting, is consumed with plots, plans and strategies for indulging themselves, gaining wealth and growing power at all costs. (outline from January 2019) As you can see in hindsight, this UniParty resistance effort was all very predictable."
"Trump Signs Order Lowering Drug Prices For Seniors, Infuriating Big Pharma",14 SEP 2020,2774,"On Sunday, President Trump did something that infuriated the big drug companies and their heavily protected lobby… he signed an executive order that lowers drug costs for seniors. Just The News reported: President Trump on Sunday signed an executive order moving Medicare one step closer to a “most favored nation” drug pricing system, instructing the government health care program for seniors to develop and test paying the same drug prices as other developed countries with cost controls. “It is the policy of the United States that the Medicare program should not pay more for costly Part B or Part D prescription drugs or biological products than the most-favored-nation price,” Trump’s order declares. The memo defines the most-favored-nation price as “the lowest price, after adjusting for volume and differences in national gross domestic product, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.” Trump’s approach is strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and some conservatives who prefer the free market set competitive prices. But the president has been arguing since 2018 that U.S. senior pays far higher prices because drug makers off-load the development costs on Americans while providing discounts in foreign countries with cost controls. “Americans pay more per capita for prescription drugs than residents of any other developed country in the world,” the president’s order said. “It is unacceptable that Americans pay more for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same places.  Other countries’ governments regulate drug prices by negotiating with drug manufacturers to secure bargain prices, leaving Americans to make up the difference — effectively subsidizing innovation and lower-cost drugs for the rest of the world.” Trump crowed about his order Sunday afternoon in a tweet. “My Most Favored Nation order will ensure that our Country gets the same low price Big Pharma gives to other countries,” he wrote. “The days of global freeriding at America’s expense are over … and prices are coming down FAST!” Just signed a new Executive Order to LOWER DRUG PRICES! My Most Favored Nation order will ensure that our Country gets the same low price Big Pharma gives to other countries. The days of global freeriding at America’s expense are over…— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2020 PhRMA, the drug maker’s main lobby group, immediately decried the action as “irresponsible and unworkable,” signaling a future showdown in the courts. Trump’s plan “will give foreign governments a say in how America provides access to treatments and cures for seniors and people struggling with devastating diseases,” the drug lobby argued."
"Trump Rally In Nevada Attacked For ‘Compliance’ Violations, Venue Warned",14 SEP 2020,3317,"In Nevada, President Trump spoke to a packed, indoor campaign rally on Sunday night, infuriating leftists and the governor of the state who claimed it violated his “directives.” Fox 5 Vegas reported: President Donald Trump held a packed, indoor campaign rally in Henderson on Sunday night, defying the state’s mitigation measures for COVID-19. The City of Henderson issued a compliance letter and verbal warning to the venue hosting President Donald Trump’s rally, according to a city spokeswoman. In a statement, spokeswoman Kathleen Richards said the warnings alerted Xtreme Manufacturing that the event would be “in direct violation of the governor’s COVID-19 emergency directives.” … It was not immediately known how many people were in attendance at the event in Henderson. … Temperature checks were given to all upon entrance at the industrial site in Henderson and while masks were encouraged, few wore them. “If you can join tens of thousands of people protesting in the streets, gamble in a casino, or burn down small businesses in riots, you can gather peacefully under the 1st Amendment to hear from the President of the United States,” campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told The Associated Press. The directive in Nevada has limited gatherings to 50 people since May. The state is also following guidance provided from the White House. “Large live events must be approved by the Nevada Department of Business and Industry, Division of Industrial Relations and at this time, the City has not been notified that this event has been approved. If the governor’s directives are not followed, the City may assess a fine of up to $500 per violation as well as suspend or revoke the business license,” said Richards. Gov. Steve Sisolak on Sunday night issued a statement saying the president is “taking reckless and selfish actions that are putting countless lives in danger here in Nevada.” [More about how evil the president is and how righteous his mandated policies concerning ‘public health are… blahblahblah..] … Trump on Sunday morning held a socially distanced Latinos for Trump roundtable at Treasure Island. He spoke at the “Great American Comeback” rally at Xtreme Manufacturing at 7 p.m. Xtreme Manufacturing is owned by local businessman Don Ahern, also chairman and CEO of Ahern Rentals and owner of the Ahern Hotel, formerly the Lucky Dragon. The hotel was fined more than $10,000 last month by the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration for hosting an “Evangelicals for Trump” event. The Henderson facility has a page on its website with information on the company’s COVID-19 response for employees and customers, including “We have restricted meetings and gatherings to no more than 10 people in large areas, and when possible, to attend meetings by telephone or video conferencing.” Trump was expected to leave Nevada for California on Monday morning. McCarran International Airport alerted drivers of potential road closures for the departure. An exact time was not provided.

"Dem PAC Busted For Getting Half Of Donations From “Unemployed, Untraceable” Donors",14 SEP 2020,7772,"In a bombshell revelation, a conservative political group has raised serious questions about where democrats are getting wads of cash. ActBlue apparently received over half of its 2019 donations from “unemployed” individuals who could not be traced. The group is on track to repeat that performance this year, with the average unemployed “donor” forking over about $100 each. Many people question where these unemployed donors got the money. Fox News reported: Less than two months ahead of the presidential election – with concerns of foreign interference again at the forefront – a conservative political group is raising “serious concerns” about millions of donations reported by a major Democratic fundraising platform. A preliminary computer analysis by the Take Back Action Fund, obtained exclusively by Fox News, has found that nearly half of all 2019 donations to ActBlue were made by people claiming to be unemployed. Action Fund President John Pudner questioned the veracity of those donations and called it a loophole that must be closed for the sake of election integrity. “After downloading hundreds of millions of [dollars in] donations to the Take Back Action Fund servers, we were shocked to see that almost half of the donations to ActBlue in 2019 claimed to be unemployed individuals,” he said. “The name of employers must be disclosed when making political donations, but more than 4.7 million donations came from people who claimed they did not have an employer. Those 4.7 million donations totaled $346 million ActBlue raised and sent to liberal causes.” The trend is continuing this year: An Action Fund examination of 2020 data from January through August showed an uptick in “unemployed” donations through ActBlue, to 50.1% this year. ActBlue defends the integrity of its donations and said many come from retirees and people who aren’t counted as employed, such as homemakers. According to the findings of the Action Fund – a nonprofit that aims to “educate the public on conservative solutions for political reform” – 48.4% of ActBlue donations last year, prior to the massive loss of jobs that came with the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic, came from those who did not list an employer or who claimed to be unemployed. Pudner said the large number is a red flag that some donations may be illicit contributions from foreign interests attempting to impact U.S. elections. “It is hard to believe that at a time when the U.S. unemployment rate was less than 4 percent, that unemployed people had $346 million dollars to send to ActBlue for liberal causes,” Pudner said, adding that “4.7 million donations from people without a job … raised serious concerns.”ActBlue, created in 2004, bills itself as a “powerful online fundraising platform available to Democratic candidates and committees, progressive organizations, and nonprofits that share our values for no cost besides a 3.95% processing fee on donations.” “And we operate as a conduit, which means donations made through ActBlue to a campaign or organization are considered individual donations,” its website explains. But critics, including the Action Fund, contend that the website allows credit card donations that are not verified, so anyone from any country in the world can donate without a paper trail. “ActBlue’s insistence on refusing to allow banks to verify their donations is an invitation to foreign programmers or others to send money through them using fake American names, and we encourage them to start letting banks verify the identity of donors to stop the potential for millions of dollars to influence our election,” Pudner said. Last year, the Republican Party created a competing fundraising platform called WinRed to counter ActBlue’s prowess in small-donor sourcing. According to the Action Fund, an analysis of WinRed’s 4.9 million donations totaling $302 million found that only 4% came from people who did not list an employer or were unemployed. This year, the rate is 5.6%, according to the data. 2019 data compiled by Take Back Action Fund (Take Back Action Fund) “We purposely wanted to examine 2019 first, because, before COVID-19, the unemployment rate was at 4 percent or below. It’s hard to believe that millions of Americans who were out of work had $346 million to spare to give to ActBlue for liberal causes,” Pudner said. Precisely determining if the donations were authentic and genuinely from those who were unemployed requires further time and resources, he said. “Auditing these suspect donations to determine if millions lied by indicating they were unemployed when in fact they were not, or if their names were just being used by a foreign programmer or someone else to move money without their knowledge, will take time,” Pudner said. “We’ve planned a series of forensic procedures to identify whether or not these donors of record exist or not, if they made the contributions themselves, and whether they were legally able, and whether or not they are potential ‘straw’ donors, making the contributions after being given the money and direction by someone else.” In response to questions by Fox News, a representative for ActBlue said “it is best security practice to refrain from publicly sharing any detailed information about how we analyze contributions.” “But we use an array of data sources, internal validation and third-party services to verify the validity of transactions. We take the security of our platform and integrity of donations very seriously,” the spokesperson said. “We report every contribution to federal candidates that comes through our platform, and you can look those up on the FEC. We report the information donors enter about their occupation and employer, and we do see a significant portion of donors who report their status as not employed, such as retired donors or full-time parents.” The issue of unauthenticated political donations was also brought to light by The Washington Post in 2008, which was at the time “allowing donors to use largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor’s identity.” In 2015, the Action Fund said millions of dollars “could be moved by allowing unverified credit card contributions,” and Pudner said that even today, ActBlue continues to use such an “unverified system.” “We found it took other vendors only a matter of hours to switch their system to allow verification of donations and thus prevent the possibility of illegal foreign money being moved into campaigns,” Pudner said. “Choosing to use an untraceable system has a higher cost in terms of the risk of credit card fraud and also tends to incur higher bank fees. And this untraceable system allows someone with a gift card to make donations in anyone’s name, even if that person never actually made that donation, or even if that person doesn’t exist at all.” Despite such claims, ActBlue currently holds the highest level of certification as a service provider. Both WinRed and ActBlue note on their donation pages that law requires donors to list their employer and occupation. “The problem,” Pudner said, “is on the back end where ActBlue does not allow banks to verify the identity of the cardholder, meaning someone could buy endless gift cards and list any name they wanted and leave the employer line blank or type in words like ‘not employed,’ ‘unemployed.'” Data complied from January-August 2020 (Take Back Action Fund) “With half of ActBlue donors indicating they do not have an employer, we recommend they start letting their payment processors verify donations to stop any foreign or other illicit donations by simply listing themselves as an unemployed American,” Pudner added."
"Leftists Immediately Reverse Segregated “Café” For Whites Only, Supposedly To ‘Discuss’ Experiences",11 SEP 2020,6253,"The University of Michigan-Dearborn has backtracked their racist plan to create an all white café, designed to supposedly promote discussions about race. It appears that the race shaming got a little too far afield, since the very actions they promoted were a throwback to the segregation democrats have always supported. The Hill reported: The University of Michigan-Dearborn on Wednesday issued an apology for creating segregated online student “cafes” that the school intended to use to promote discussions on race and diversity. The two virtual discussions were held by the university on Tuesday, with one labeled as a “non-POC Cafe” intended for students who are not people of color to “gather and discuss their experience as students on campus and as non-POC in the world,” according to the event description, CBS News reported. The second group was intended specifically for “marginalized racial/ethnic/cultural communities to gather and to relate with one another to discuss their experience as students on campus.” … These events come one month after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) signed an executive order declaring racism a public health crisis in the state. The order also mandated the creation of a state advisory council on Black leadership, as well as instructions for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to have all state employees complete implicit bias training in an effort to “make health equity a major goal.” Interestingly, the university ONLY changed the policy after being criticized. The Post Millennial reported: Segregation is alive and well at the University of Michigan Dearborn, where leftists have created a cafe only for white people. From U of M – Dearborn. The Non-POC Cafe or the “White Cafe.” Anyway, I wonder what the menu looks like for the Non-POC Cafe at UM-Dearborn. If they have chocolate hummus I am calling for a boycott. pic.twitter.com/8ZegRv7zet — Abed A. Ayoub (@aayoub) September 9, 2020 The “Non-POC Cafe” will be “holding space for students that do not identity as POC (people of color).” It was unveiled this week, and students must RSVP to enter the cafe, where presumably, they will get to hang out exclusively with people of their own race. It does not appear to be that the intention of this segregated cafe is a lesson in what it was like before the abolishment of laws that enforced segregation. The statement on the site launching this new, segregationist initiative, reads “The Non-POC (People Of Color) Cafe is a space for students that do not identify as persons of color to gather and to discuss their experience as students on campus and as non-POC in the world. Feel free to drop in and discuss your experiences as non-persons of color and hopefully brainstorm solutions to common issues within the non-POC community.” Not only are white people who don’t identify themselves by a melanin-infused skin tone meant to talk about how they feel about being white people, about not being “of colour,” their conversation will be “facilitated.” “The Cafe will be facilitated by a non-POC faculty/staff member to ensure that discussions are kept safe and respectful.” To recap, the white people who gather to talk about their whiteness will be observed by a white person to make sure that their discussions on whiteness are of the appropriate kind. The cafe will recurring, “bi-monthly, generally to occur on the 1st Tuesday of every month at 2:00pm and the 3rd Wednesday of every month at 7:00pm. Dates and times are subject to change depending on feedback and demand.” Just in case those non-white persons who identify as persons of colour felt left out of this leftist, segregationist model, the University of Michigan has created a cafe that is only for students of colour, as well. It is unclear as to which cafe will have the better water fountains. Update! Seems like @UM_Dearborn has two cafes. Competing cafes. I get the intention but this was not thought out and very lazy. pic.twitter.com/BqTFy8rXN6 — Abed A. Ayoub (@aayoub) September 9, 2020 Other universities have taken up the same line. Boston University’s Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground (HTC) also aims at creating equality by segregating students by race. This strict exclusion is done to be inclusive. Upcoming at the HTC is a “Black Community Reception,” which will be the 20th annual event of this kind. Additional exclusive inclusive events were held for LGBTQIA+ and Latinx students. BU also has a people of colour playground, which touts itself as “a space for students to ask and be asked difficult questions about who they are and how they fit in the world.” These segregationist spaces are being created under the mission of diversity, equity and inclusion and have been perpetrated by those espousing leftist ideology. The Post Millennial has reached out to the The Center for Social Justice & Inclusion at University of Michigan for comment, and they said that UM-Dearborn regrets having using the term “cafe” to describe the events, and that “the descriptions themselves were not clear and not reflective of the university’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.” They said that the university “is committed to fostering and maintaining an inclusive campus environment and encourages ongoing dialogue amongst our students, faculty and staff on challenging issues.” “The original intent,” they said “was to provide students from marginalized communities a space that allowed for them to exist freely without having to normalize their lives and experiences, while also providing students that do not identify as persons of color the opportunity to deepen their understanding of race and racism without harming or relying on students of color to educate them.” They said that “The events were never intended to be exclusive or exclusionary for individuals of a certain race. Both events were open to all members of the UM-Dearborn campus community.” The university has since taken down the page despite the earlier declaration that these cafes would be a bimonthly events. When asked why the page was taken down, a spokesman for the school said that “the page was taken down because when the next discussion about race occurs, it will have updated and more descriptive messaging.”"
"Biden Attacks Trump’s “Criminal” COVID ‘Response,’ Forgets He Told People Not To “Panic”",10 SEP 2020,5257,"In February, democrats in California and New York were encouraging people to go to Chinatown, and continue on with their daily lives because COVID was nothing more than the flu. Joe Biden himself told people not to panic. President Trump drew hostile criticism for cancelling flights from China, while democrats were pushing their bogus impeachment. Now, however, in a ridiculous turn of events, democrats are claiming that the president’s response cost lives, and Joe Biden has attacked him for supposedly downplaying it. This is how stupid they think Americans are. Breitbart News reported: Sean Hannity aired archival footage on Fox News of Biden speaking to supporters in Sumter, South Carolina, on Feb. 28 — one day before Biden won the state’s primary, securing his first victory in three presidential campaigns and creating a path to the nomination. “Barack [Obama] and I, when we were — as president and vice president – we took on the virus that was threatening all of Africa and, uh, the rest of the world,” Biden said, forgetting the name of the Ebola virus. “And we set up a mechanism that worked. “But I want to take a moment to say it’s not a time to panic about coronavirus, but coronavirus is a serious public health challenge.” Biden would later repeat his admonishment not to “panic” about the coronavirus in a speech March 12, the day after the World Health Organization declared the virus a “pandemic.” On that occasion, Biden also warned people not to “downplay” the virus — which is what Trump [supposedly] admitted in March to journalist Bob Woodward he had done, because he did not want to encourage panic. Prior to late February, the Democratic candidates had largely ignored the issue. When President Trump declared a travel ban on China, Biden dismissed the measure as “hysterical xenophobia.” Later on Hannity, Karl Rove pointed out numerous statements by Biden’s health policy advisers telling Americans not to panic, including a comment by Biden aide Ron Klein calling the coronavirus a “fear epidemic.” Breitbart News reported: Former Vice President Joe Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper during an interview set to air Thursday on “The Lead” that President Donald Trump’s [supposed] admissions to Bob Woodward about downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus were “disgusting.” Biden said Trump’s response to the virus that has killed over 190,000 in the United States is “almost criminal.” Anchor Jake Tapper said, “So big, breaking news. In his upcoming book, Bob Woodward reports that President Trump understood the serious risk posed by the novel coronavirus in early February. Take a look at what the president told Woodward February 7th.” In audio, Trump said, “You just breathe the air. That’s how it is passed. So that is a very tricky one, a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than your, you know, even your strenuous flus. This is deadly stuff.” Tapper said, “As you know, the president spent much of February and even March downplaying the risk of the novel coronavirus saying it would disappear saying the heat would make it go away. What is your response to this news about what he was telling Bob Woodward on February 7?” Biden said, “Disgusting. We learn this on a day that 190,000 Americans are dead, and he knew this? I understand he had just gotten off the phone when he did the first interview with Woodward. He had just gotten off the phone with Xi Jinping, where he is praising him about transparency, and this is nothing to worry about, and this is going to go away like a miracle. What in God’s name would a man like —I don’t get it. I truly don’t get it. It’s like the way he talks about our veterans. It’s astounding to me.” Tapper said, “The way that President Trump explains it, and he said this to Woodward on March 19 if you take a listen.” In audio, Trump said, “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down. Because I don’t want to create a panic.” Biden said, “That’s why we have no confidence in his leadership. I mean, look, you saw what Columbia Medical School pointed out in March, had he acted one week earlier, there would be over 31,000 more people alive. Two weeks earlier would have been 50 some thousand still alive. This caused people to die. What did he do the whole time? He acknowledged that if you breathed it, it’s in the air, and he won’t put on a mask. He’s talking about it’s ridiculous to put on masks. What do you need social distancing for? Why have any of these rules? It was all about making sure the stock market didn’t come down, that his wealthy friends didn’t lose any money, and that he could say that, in fact, anything that happened had nothing to do with him.

"Dictator Whitmer Orders $1.1 Million For 8’ Fence, Increased Security Around Mansion",10 SEP 2020,8716,"Democrat governor (aka dictator) of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has arbitrarily nullified the individual freedoms and systematically removed the safety protections of the people in her state, cutting hundreds of millions from police budgets. Yet, in typical liberal hypocrisy, she has ordered increased security for her mansion, including spending $1.1 million for an electrified fence around the property to protect it from the Marxist rioters she encourages. https://twitter.com/TimRunsHisMouth/status/1303656234986467329 Interestingly, Whitmer has publically attacked the president for building a border wall, adding to the disgusting double standard democrats believe is their superior birthright. Law Enforcement Today reported: Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has publicly attacked President Trump in the past for his insistence of a border wall to help deter illegal aliens from entering the country.  In February of 2017, she said: Trump’s proposed Mexican border wall would be costly & ineffective. Both Republicans & Democrats agree #NoWallNoBan https://t.co/g6b8l136nl — Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) February 5, 2017 “Trump’s proposed Mexican border wall would be costly & ineffective.  Both Republicans & Democrats agree.” She then tweeted: “$40 BILLION for the wall.  Think how many kids that would educate, how many roads, bridges and pipes it would fix.”  $40 BILLION for the wall. Think how many kids that would educate, how many roads, bridges and pipes it would fix. https://t.co/R9HaqLAsMZ — Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) January 25, 2017 Whitmer also had a campaign saying when she ran for governor in 2018.  She said: “We must stand together, because when we do, we cannot fail. It is time we get back to building bridges. Not walls.” pic.twitter.com/TARxBlnKKW — Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) June 30, 2018 “We must stand together, because when we do, we cannot fail.  It is time we get back to building bridges.  Not walls.”  Despite all of the talk of building bridges and not walls, that is exactly what Whitmer is doing by placing an eight-foot electrified fence around her property.  She will not only be keeping out illegal aliens, as the border wall does, she will be keeping everyone out. According to the Detroit News, Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer said: “Routine maintenance and upgrades are performed as needed to ensure the safety, security and protection of any sitting governor and the first family.”  And while those types of upgrades to ensure the safety of the first family would normally be viewed as appropriate, how about the needs for the citizens of the United States to feel safe from people illegally entering into the country? How is it that Whitmer believes that it is appropriate to build a ‘wall’ around her property, for her protection, but one cannot be built along the border, for the protection of the country? Brown said that the fence and other security measures were done at the recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Department of Technology.  Shannon Banner, a spokeswoman for the Michigan State Police said: “As a matter of practice, we’re constantly reviewing security protocols and adjusting as needed.  We don’t comment on specific threats against the governor nor do we provide information about security measures.” This is not the first time that Whitmer or her family have been the center of controversy as of late.  In May, Marc Mallory, Whitmer’s husband, contacted the boating company that stores the couple’s boat in northern Michigan, asking for it to be ready for launch before Memorial Day. Now, this would not necessarily be a controversy except for two main points, one, he asked for the owner to launch the boat as a special favor as he was married to the governor.  Two, the boat launch was in an area that Whitmer had specifically requested people who do not live there go to due to the pandemic. Of course, supporters of Whitmer will say that the family owns a home there, this is true.  However, they live in Lansing, which is roughly 200 miles away from that location. When this information came to light, Brown said: “Our practice is not to discuss the governor’s or her family’s personal calendar/schedules.  And we’re not going to make it a practice of addressing every rumor that is spread online.” Of course, this was not a flat-out denial, but the innuendo is there that this incident did not occur.  However, as rumors continued to swirl around the issue, Whitmer had to address it with the media. Whitmer said: “I do feel compelled to address the most recent one [rumor] about my husband Marc.  My husband made a failed attempt at humor last week when checking in with a small business that helps with out boat and dock up north. “Knowing it wouldn’t make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the cue.  Obviously, with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh.  “It didn’t and to be honest I wasn’t laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived.  He regrets it, I wish it wouldn’t have happened and that’s really all we have to say about it.” Michigan state senator: Governor Whitmer should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths – ‘Cold blooded killed elderly patients’ MICHIGAN – During a June 19th interview on No BS New Hours, Michigan state Republican Senator Peter Lucido alleged that Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s policies with regard to co-mingling positive COVID patients with those not infected within nursing homes is at this point a criminal act. In Senator Lucido’s perspective, Governor Whitmer “cold-blooded killed” elderly patients within the state’s nursing homes by the very practice. State Senator: Gretchen Whitmer ‘Cold-Blooded Killed’ Nursing Home Patients; Vows to Prosecute Governor https://t.co/YWs0S2kzgv — ♡ 𝕎𝕚𝕝𝕝 ℕ𝕠𝕥 ℂ𝕠𝕞𝕡𝕝𝕪 ♡ ℂ𝕛♡ #ℕ𝕆 #𝔻𝕄𝕊 (@ShotsRangOut) June 23, 2020 While speaking with the show host Charlie LeDuff, the state senator stated the following: “What our governor has done is literally cold-blooded killed the most injured parties that are out there. The ones that have compromised immune systems—cold-blooded.” When remarking on the actions taken by the governor’s disregard for common sense that he believes embarks upon criminal acts, Senator Lucido noted that the science proves that the move to keep elderly patients uninfected with COVID among those infected is grossly irresponsible: “Science and data do not support infecting healthy people who have to be protected at all costs.” Gov. Whitmer ignored the experts when they sounded the alarm about COVID-19 in nursing homes, and Michiganders suffered. While Whitmer won’t take responsibility for her actions, I am thankful our Representatives are working to hold her accountable. https://t.co/gzh4UP5rIh — Laura Cox (@MIGOPChair) June 27, 2020 While not mincing his words, Senator Lucido’s take on the matter was a little more tactful in his mentioning of the debacle as opposed to show host LeDuff’s take. The No BS News Hour host said that Governor Whitmer needed to “swallow” her pride and “get the goddamn shit fixed.” When the senator was asked whether he’d explore the possibility of seeing if criminal proceedings could be levied against the state’s governor if he were ever elected as prosecutor, Lucido responded with the following: “You’re damn right. I’d be looking at this real carefully and saying, ‘What medical data and expert did you rely on?’” Rather than simply answer our questions, Governor Whitmer has refused to cooperate. Even worse, House Democrats are letting her get away with it. But grieving families still deserve answers, and her stonewalling won’t stop us from getting them.https://t.co/Nl18pEtr70 — Select Committee Republicans (@SelectGOP) June 23, 2020 Senator Lucido explained that via Governor Whitmer essentially poising herself during the COVID response as being the sole decision maker on numerous matters related to the pandemic, he would absolutely prosecute her is he were in said position of power: “I can look down at the data, which is not there, the science, which is not there, and have doctors come to testify to support that the medical decisions that were made here were made unilaterally by one person only…Gretchen Whitmer – you’re damn right she’s going to get charged because she deserves to own up to those deaths in those nursing homes.” Governor Whitmer’s response to COVID in relation to nursing homes bears a significant resemblance to the backlash that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo received for running similar nursing home practices during the outbreak."
UN Forced To Admit Gates-Funded Vaccine Causing Polio Outbreak In Africa,8 SEP 2020,5063,"Bill Gates is making millions and millions of dollars helping to ‘vaccinate’ third world countries with the assistance of the World Health Organization. But, his efforts have had the supposed opposite intent of the action. Instead of eradicating polio, the vaccines have caused a ‘super’ strain, and the United Nations has been forced to admit that the supposed vaccine is actually spurring an outbreak of the deadly disease… reducing the population, as Gates has championed. Zero Hedge reported: The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing the outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out. While international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) will regular boast about supposedly ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines, the opposite seems to be the case. Their decades-long campaign to eradicate polio is now killing scores of innocent young people living in poor countries. Now it seems that health officials are beginning to admit that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent of polio to spread. This latest pharma-induced pandemic has broken out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, and the culprit has been identified: a vaccine-derived polio virus type 2. Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world. Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the corporate pharmaceutical vaccine distributed there. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio. It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine being pushed on to the African population by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All of this should be a cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giant all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population. Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African population through GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials will take place in South Africa, locally managed by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—yet another Gates-funded institution. Top of Form Bottom of Form Top of Form Bottom of Form This latest revelation from Africa should prompt media and health advocates to ask hard questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hyped COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine. AP News reports… The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad –  a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted.. Read more here…"
"Portland Man Arrested, and Released After Attempted Vehicular Homicide of Federal Officers",3 SEP 2020,3223,"Apparently, according to a judge in Oregon, trying to murder federal officers is a crime that allows the suspect to walk free. Fox News reported: A Portland man is accused of chasing two federal officers on an Oregon roadway and trying multiple times to hit them with his car – successfully crashing into their vehicle twice, the U.S. Justice Department announced Wednesday. A U.S. magistrate judge released Lonnie Vantewa Albert, pending future court appearances, following his Tuesday hearing in connection with the allegations he assaulted two Federal Protective Service officers with a sports utility vehicle early Sunday morning, according to a Department of Justice press release. Albert, 55, faces up to eight years if convicted. The pair of officers, who were in uniform and wearing “visible police patches and a badge,” had just left the Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal Building in Portland in a rental car, officials said. They were heading back to their hotel when one of the officers spotted a gray SUV – allegedly being driven by Albert – passing them on the left. Authorities said Albert looked toward the officers before he “turned sharply” and nearly crashed into their vehicle. “The driving officer made several attempts to change lanes and pass Albert, but Albert swerved in either direction to block their vehicle,” police said. “After positioning his vehicle to the officers’ left, Albert turned sharply to the right, striking the officers’ vehicle and causing his own vehicle to spin before coming to a stop.” When one of the officers got out of the car, officials said Albert “drove toward the officer, veered left and fled the scene. Officers gathered Albert’s license plate number and followed his vehicle to a hospital, Adventist Health Portland, which is near where Albert stopped, the DOJ said. He allegedly struck the officers’ rental car a second time as they pulled into the hospital’s parking lot. It wasn’t immediately clear if either of the officers was injured. Albert was later arrested by the Portland Police Bureau. Portland has endured nearly 100 days of nightly unrest following the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, including two weeks in July when thousands of protesters clashed with U.S. agents sent to protect the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse. Local police have arrested hundreds of people since Floyd’s death. Just Tuesday, Portland’s police chief denounced protesters who broke windows and set fire to a business in the upscale apartment building where Mayor Ted Wheeler lives. Chief Chuck Lovell labeled the events an escalation in the street violence that Oregon’s largest city has endured for months. Lovell said the demonstrators also wound up targeting other people who live in Wheeler’s building and have had nothing to do with the protests. Previously, the demonstrators have almost always clashed with police outside symbols of authority – police buildings and courthouses. “The families that live inside have done absolutely nothing to provoke a threat to their lives. As I’ve stated repeatedly, the nightly violence is coming at increased cost,” he said. “This is impacting the safety of our entire city and urgent action is needed.”"
Cuomo Threatens President Trump With Needing “Protection”,3 SEP 2020,3848,"Yesterday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made a veiled threat against President Trump, after learning about the funding withdrawal the president has planned for democrat controlled states and cities that are allowing rampant lawlessness. The New York Post Reported: Cuomo called an emergency press briefing within a half hour on Wednesday night to tear into Trump for the order, which cites New York’s rising murder rate and defunding of the NYPD. “He better have an army if he thinks he’s gonna walk down the street in New York. New Yorkers don’t want to have anything to do with him,” the Democrat said, all but threatening the commander in chief. But Cuomo, who like Trump hails from Queens, wasn’t done. “He can’t have enough bodyguards to walk through New York City, people don’t want to have anything to do with him.” On substance, Cuomo said he doubted the legality of Trump’s five-page memo ordering a review of federal funds that can be redirected from New York City, Portland, Seattle and Washington, DC. “It is more of the same from him. It’s political, it is gratuitous. And it’s illegal. But it is another attempt to kill New York City,” Cuomo said. “President Ford said drop dead. President Trump has been actively trying to kill New York City since he’s been elected,” he said. In highly personal and insulting language, Cuomo speculated that Trump wasn’t upset about New York’s soaring murder rate and shootings. “I think it’s because he is from New York City and New York City rejected him, always,” Cuomo said. “He was dismissed as a clown in New York City, those who know him best, like him least.” Cuomo jeered: “He was disrespected in New York City. Nobody took him seriously and he was just a tabloid cartoon.” Referring to a claim in Trump’s niece Mary Trump’s recent book, Cuomo said, “his sister, a former federal judge, is disgraced by him.” The governor also claimed Trump’s “negligence” is the reason New York state suffered the highest COVID-19 death toll. The governor’s critics blame his Health Department’s mandate that forbade nursing homes from turning away COVID-19-positive patients, potentially leading to at least 6,500 deaths. At the end of his call, Cuomo, apparently sensing how his remarks about Trump could be seen as threatening, attempted to walk them back. “My comment about the president and bodyguards in New York City, all I’m saying is that he is persona non grata in New York City. And I think he knows that. And he’ll never come back to New York, because New Yorkers will never forget how gratuitously mean he has been to New Yorkers and how many times he’s tried to kill the city that gave him his start and birthed him. That’s what I meant about the bodyguards.” Earlier Wednesday, Trump called on CNN to fire Cuomo’s younger brother Chris Cuomo over a leaked tape in which he says he was questioned about sexual misconduct. “Fredo must go!” Trump wrote, using an insulting reference from “The Godfather.” Meanwhile, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was twice mentioned by name in Trump’s order, had his press secretary Bill Neidhardt respond. “As much as Donald Trump wants New York City to drop dead, we will never let this stand,” Neidhardt tweeted. “This has nothing to do with “law and order”. This is a racist campaign stunt out of the Oval Office to attack millions of people of color.” De Blasio himself made no statement. City councilman Rory Lancman, chair of Committee on the Justice System, meanwhile, said Trump’s order could unintentionally weaken public safety. “I guess we know now which candidate for president supports defunding the police,” he quipped. Rep. Max Rose, a Trump-targeted Democrat who represents Staten Island and southern Brooklyn, said, “With this order, President Trump is joining Mayor de Blasio in defunding the police. It was wrong then and it’s wrong now.”"
"As VA Plans Mandatory Vaccine, Compare COVID Deaths In Countries Where HCQ Was Used Early",2 SEP 2020,5241,"During a recent interview, the Virginia State health commissioner, Dr. Norman Oliver, explained that he intends to use his emergency powers to force every Virginian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. This forced Governor Ralph Northam to come out and say that he hasn’t decided on a vaccine mandate yet, for adults… but bills that would allow for legitimate objections have been quashed by the democrat controlled legislature. All this is happening despite the fact that there is already a very effective cure for COVID. The American Thinker explained: The most recent casualty [of democrat obstruction], H.B. 5082, “would’ve ensured that Virginia didn’t mandate a COVID-19 vaccine if it is derived from human fetal tissue, changes the RNA or DNA of a person, or was not first tested on laboratory animals before being tested on humans.”  These actions triggered a “March against Mandates” in Richmond on September 2 by Virginia Freedom Keepers. But wait — there’s more politics brewing. Yesterday’s Richmond Times-Dispatch published a letter from a former FDA medical officer.  He agrees that using convalescent blood plasma from patients who developed antibodies works, and he cited its many successes dating back to the 1918 flu pandemic. However, he claims that the number of people tested this time was “far out of proportion to the number needed for safety analyses.” He also objects that authorities in the FDA and Donald Trump made overly optimistic claims that it could result in a 35% reduction in mortality and said this type of politics undermines the FDA’s credibility. Meanwhile, the left’s successful war against hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) rages on.  The subject was brought up repeatedly by highly respected Yale epidemiology professor Dr. Harvey Risch, this time when interviewed by Mark Levin on Fox News a couple of Sundays ago. Dr. Risch is adamant that HCQ can significantly reduce mortality if administered early to prevent the potentially deadly inflammation reaction that is especially common in older patients and those with comorbidities.  Thousands could have been saved.  PragerU posted similar claims by several frontline doctors here.  The left’s cancel culture got some of these same doctors fired. It has been my personal quest to find some hard proof that compares countries that have widely used HCQ early in the pandemic with those who did not.  Some key data finally emerged from a site devoted to climate change in a 23 August article by Leo Goldstein titled “Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Treatment, Actual Usage in the USA.”  The needed comparisons were found in one of the author’s references, titled Early treatment with hydroxychloroquine: a country-based analysis. This is not an easy report to read, but it does provide some easy-to-understand visual comparisons between the countries known to have very limited use of HCQ use and those with widespread early HCQ use.  The differences are remarkable, as seen in the below Figure 4.  It shows cumulative daily deaths per million through 31 August.  The countries listed on the left are limited HCQ–users and represented by red lines.  The widespread HCQ–using countries are listed on the right and represented by green lines. The bottom line is that total deaths to date per million for countries using HCQ averages over 80% lower than in countries with limited use.  So far so good… The referenced analysis did not chart the moving average of daily deaths for any of these countries to help know when and how high the deaths peaked or how low they fell.  However, by modifying a chart from the Our World in Data website, it was possible to depict a seven-day moving average of COVID-19 daily deaths per million for the same countries shown in the above Figure 4 chart (minus some smaller countries to make it fit).  Note that the scales are different because the previous chart counts the cumulative total deaths per million from the beginning, and the below chart depicts the change in the average daily death rates over the same time period.  The trend lines tell the story. Note that all countries with limited HCQ use surged initially, but most have decreased to below 1 death per million in recent months!  The U.S. and Mexico are troubling exceptions.  Also, Sweden’s deaths spiked higher than the U.S.’s, but the Swedes had only a limited lockdown and post the lowest daily deaths. Perhaps these other non-HCQ countries achieved herd immunity or started using it or other anti-inflammatory drugs later.  In comparison, virtually all the countries reporting early widespread HCQ use averaged below one death daily per million during the entire pandemic without an initial surge.  Think of the thousands of potential deaths they avoided. In conclusion, these charts confirm that countries with early widespread HCQ use have had significantly fewer COVID-19 deaths per million.  The problem now is to get the leftists to end their deadly war on HCQ. The authorization of widespread use of HCQ could also lessen dependence on a potentially risky vaccine or convalescent blood plasma.  Regardless, HCQ is most effective when administered early in the progression of the disease.  Doing it early necessitates outpatient use."
MSNBC Reporter Resigns: Blasts Networks As “Propaganda Arm” Of Deep State,31 AUG 2020,11174,"According to a military reporter for MSNBC, that network has become the “propaganda arm of the CIA and FBI” and routinely spreads disinformation to the public. It’s so bad, this respected journalist is calling it quits and blasting the network in the process. News Punch reported: Arkin recently blasted NBC News along with MSNBC news in an email for “becoming captive and subservient to the national security state, reflexively pro-war in the name of stopping President Donald Trump, and now the prime propaganda instrument of the War Machine’s promotion of militarism and imperialism.” Thanks to the collapse of the Russian collusion hoax, relentlessly pushed by mainstream media for the last three years, millions of ordinary Americans are slowly waking up to the fact the mainstream media does not always tell the truth. [Sadly, at least 75 percent of democrats—controlled by the mainstream media—still believe that President Trump colluded with Russia, despite the evidence that is never reported.] But the lies did not begin with the concocted theory that President Trump was colluding with the Kremlin. The mainstream media has always pushed disinformation on behalf of shady government agencies with the purpose of manipulating society. It’s why the mainstream networks were created in the first place. According to William Arkin, the spooks in the mainstream media are in a stronger position than ever before. Indeed, “the national security establishment not only hasn’t issued a beat but indeed has gained dangerous strength,” and “is ever more autonomous and practically impervious to criticism.” Another great quote comes to mind here, “The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation . . . The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties . . . [and] control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection.” (source)– Mayor of New York City from 1918-1925 CollectiveEvolution reports: Arkin has worked with NBC and MSNBC since 2016, and it’s great to see that he’s leaving due to the fact that these outlets have become nothing but the “central propaganda arm of the CIA, the Pentagon, and the FBI.” This network alone consists of former CIA, NSA and Pentagon officials as news analysts. MSNBC host and former Bush-Cheney Communications Director Nicole Wallace is one of multiple great examples. Establishment Media Mouthpieces MSNBC’s star national security reporter Ken Dilanian was widely mocked by media outlets for years for being an uncritical CIA stenographer before he became a beloved NBC/MSNBC reporter, and let’s not forget CNN’s Anderson Cooper’s connections to the CIA. Operation Mockingbird, a CIA program to infiltrate mainstream media and use it to influence the minds of the masses decades ago, seems to be in full effect today, at a larger scale than anyone can possibly imagine. In early 2018, NBC hired former CIA chief John Brennan to serve as a “senior national security and intelligence analyst.” A declassified document from the CIA archives in the form of a letter from a CIA task force addressed to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency details the close relationship that exists between the CIA and mainstream media and academia. The document states that the CIA task force “now has relationships with reporters from every major wire service, newspaper, news weekly, and television network in the nation,” and that “this has helped us turn some ‘intelligence failure’ stories into ‘intelligence success” stories,’ and has contributed to the accuracy of countless others.” Furthermore, it explains how the agency has “persuaded reporters to postpone, change, hold, or even scrap stories that could have adversely affected national security interests or jeopardized sources and methods.” The Email Again, all of this lead to Arkin publishing a critique of NBC and MSNBC in the form of an email he sent to multiple outlets, including the Intercept where I first came across this story. You can read it in its entirety below. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus. … To me there is also a larger problem: though they produce nothing that resembles actual safety and security, the national security leaders and generals we have are allowed to do their thing unmolested. Despite being at “war,” no great wartime leaders or visionaries are emerging. There is not a soul in Washington who can say that they have won or stopped any conflict. And though there might be the beloved perfumed princes in the form of the Petraeus’ and Wes Clarks’, or the so-called warrior monks like Mattis and McMaster, we’ve had more than a generation of national security leaders who sadly and fraudulently have done little of consequence. And yet we (and others) embrace them, even the highly partisan formers who masquerade as “analysts”. We do so ignoring the empirical truth of what they have wrought: There is not one county in the Middle East that is safer today than it was 18 years ago. Indeed the world becomes ever more polarized and dangerous. … Windrem again convinced me to return to NBC to join the new investigative unit in the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. I thought that the mission was to break through the machine of perpetual war acceptance and conventional wisdom to challenge Hillary Clinton’s hawkishness. It was also an interesting moment at NBC because everyone was looking over their shoulder at Vice and other upstarts creeping up on the mainstream. But then Trump got elected and Investigations got sucked into the tweeting vortex, increasingly lost in a directionless adrenaline rush, the national security and political version of leading the broadcast with every snow storm. And I would assert that in many ways NBC just began emulating the national security state itself – busy and profitable. No wars won but the ball is kept in play. I’d argue that under Trump, the national security establishment not only hasn’t missed a beat but indeed has gained dangerous strength. Now it is ever more autonomous and practically impervious to criticism. I’d also argue, ever so gingerly, that NBC has become somewhat lost in its own verve, proxies of boring moderation and conventional wisdom, defender of the government against Trump, cheerleader for open and subtle threat mongering, in love with procedure and protocol over all else (including results). I accept that there’s a lot to report here, but I’m more worried about how much we are missing. Hence my desire to take a step back and think why so little changes with regard to America’s wars. … In our day-to-day whirlwind and hostage status as prisoners of Donald Trump, I think – like everyone else does – that we miss so much. People who don’t understand the medium, or the pressures, loudly opine that it’s corporate control or even worse, that it’s partisan. Sometimes I quip in response to friends on the outside (and to government sources) that if they mean by the word partisan that it is New Yorkers and Washingtonians against the rest of the country then they are right. For me I realized how out of step I was when I looked at Trump’s various bumbling intuitions: his desire to improve relations with Russia, to denuclearize North Korea, to get out of the Middle East, to question why we are fighting in Africa, even in his attacks on the intelligence community and the FBI. Of course he is an ignorant and incompetent impostor. And yet I’m alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war. Really? We shouldn’t get out Syria? We shouldn’t go for the bold move of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula? Even on Russia, though we should be concerned about the brittleness of our democracy that it is so vulnerable to manipulation, do we really yearn for the Cold War? And don’t even get me started with the FBI: What? We now lionize this historically destructive institution? Arkin has joined many others to blow the whistle on how all of this works, and how mainstream media as “become ground zero for these political pathologies of militarism and servitude to security state agencies.” A Few More Examples Dr. Udo Ulfkotte is a top German journalist and editor and has been for more than two decades. He went on the record stating that he was forced to publish the works of intelligence agents under his own name, also mentioning that noncompliance would result in him losing his job. Not long ago, he made an appearance on RT news Stating that: “I’ve been a journalist for about 25 years, and I was educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public. But seeing right now within the last months how the German and American media tries to bring war to the people in Europe, to bring war to Russia — this is a point of no return and I’m going to stand up and say it is not right what I have done in the past, to manipulate people, to make propaganda against Russia, and it is not right what my colleagues do and have done in the past because they are bribed to betray the people, not only in Germany, all over Europe.” Here is a great TEDx talk from veteran investigative journalist and former CBS NEWS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson. In it, she explains how “astroturf,” or fake grassroots movements, funded by political, corporate, or other special interests, are very effectively manipulating and distorting mainstream media messages, whether it be political or corporate. Amber Lyon is a three time Emmy award winning journalist at CNN. She has gone on record stating that the mainstream media outlets are routinely paid by the US government as well as foreign governments to selectively report and distort information on certain events. She has also stated that the United States government has editorial control over mainstream media content. Again, these are just a few examples out of many. “The problem of fake news isn’t solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because we as citizens, we as users of these services, help each other. We talk and we share and we point out what is fake. We point out what is true. The answer to bad speech is not censorship, the answer to bad speech is more speech. We have to exercise and spread the idea that critical thinking matters, now more than ever, given the fact that lies seem to be getting more popular.” –Edward Snowden (source)"
"CDC Releases New COVID Numbers Showing Only 9,210 Fatalities From Virus Alone",31 AUG 2020,3678,"This weekend, the Centers For Disease control and Prevention silently updated their COVID fatality numbers to show that only 6 percent of deaths were contributed to the virus alone. That means that less than 10,000 people in the U.S. have died from the virus… making the illness less deadly than the flu. The Gateway Pundit reported: We were first to report that the Director General of the WHO on March 3, 2020 a set off the panic with his highly flawed statement: “While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new virus to which no one has immunity. That means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease. “Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.” This statement caused a global panic.  We, however, knew it was wrong and we wrote about it on March 17, 2020. Here is the video of Dr. Ghebreyesus’s remarks. https://youtu.be/-kk-DrTCRAY The WHO leader’s coronavirus death rate number of 3.4% was false and we proved this in our post at the time. The Gateway Pundit reported, that the coronavirus fatality rate reported by the liberal mainstream media was completely inaccurate and the actual rate more typical to a seasonal flu – the media was lying again. Bottom of Form Doctors Fauci and Birx next pushed ridiculous and highly exaggerated mortality rates related to the coronavirus: ** Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx used the Imperial College Model to persuade President Trump to lock down the ENTIRE US ECONOMY.
** The fraudulent model predicted 2.2 million American deaths from the coronavirus pandemic
** The authors of the Imperial College Model shared their findings with the White House Coronavirus task force in early March
** Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx then met with President Trump privately and urged him to shut down the US economy and destroy the record Trump economy based on this model But the Imperial College model Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx pushed was garbage and they recommended the destruction of the US economy using this completely flawed model. Today we now have empirical evidence that the WHO, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx were all wrong.  They were charlatans.  They lied. The CDC silently updated their numbers this week to show that only 6% of all coronavirus deaths were completely due to the coronavirus alone.  The rest of the deaths pinned to the China coronavirus are attributed to individuals who had other serious issues going on. Also, most of the deaths are very old Americans with co-morbidities. “This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid That’s 9,210 deaths The other 94% had 2-3 other serious illnesses & the overwhelming majority were of very advanced age”https://t.co/WEZxsfcnhW pic.twitter.com/e2jPEgit1o — Mel Q  (@littllemel) August 29, 2020 Note we updated this post with tweet above because Twitter took down Mel Q’s tweet after we published this post.) Not only are the number of deaths linked entirely to the China coronavirus minuscule, but the virus appears to be naturally dying out. Okay just added in approx trend for testing rate per thousand people for each country
– shown in red at top of graphs
– this thing is insane pic.twitter.com/lifmNuvfcI — Ivor Cummins (@FatEmperor) August 18, 2020 The data above from Europe shows that the number of cases has little correlation to the number of deaths. Let’s face it – at this moment in time anyone who is pushing for more lockdowns and other abuses on our personal rights is either evil or terribly misinformed."
"Dem Speaks Out, Details Massive Voter Fraud Operations Being Conducted Everywhere",31 AUG 2020,5218,"Although many experts already knew that democrats were behind a number of fraudulent election, stealing votes and ballot stuffing to ensure that conservative voices were silenced and patriotic voters disenfranchised, a new exclusive from the New York Post has exposed liberals’ massive, coordinated effort to steal elections over the past few years. In fact, recent indictments prove that what this insider is detailing is happening all over the country. Breitbart News reported: A Democrat operative is telling all about the massive voter fraud operation deployed to rig elections for Democrats through paying homeless voters off, taking advantage of the elderly, posing as registered voters, and printing up fake ballots. An exclusive report by the New York Post‘s Jon Levine tells the stories of a Democrat operative who has personally led a staff to produce false election results via voter fraud for years now — a scheme that he suggests will be utilized in the upcoming local, state, congressional, and presidential elections on November 3: “This is a real thing,” he said. “And there is going to be a f–king war coming November 3rd over this stuff … If they knew how the sausage was made, they could fix it.” [Emphasis added] In one story, the operative explained how he and his staff make fake mail-in ballots by simply running ballots sent to registered voters through a copy machine. The envelopes used for the ballots, though, are much more difficult to recreate, so instead his staff goes door-to-door convincing voters to let them deliver their mail-in ballots for them. Then, he and the staff open the envelopes by holding them over boiling water to open the seal, remove the voter’s mail-in ballot, and replace it with their fraudulent ballot before delivering them at mailboxes in multiple towns so as not to draw suspicion. In some instances, the operative said postal workers can be in on the scheme: “You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy and he’s working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold … He can take those [filled-out] ballots, and knowing 95% are going to a Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.” [Emphasis added] Taking advantage of vulnerable voters is a vital tool for the scheme, the operative said. For example, he detailed how he and his staff have links to nursing home employees who will fill out absentee ballots for elderly residents. In other cases, his crew pays homeless voters living in shelters about $50 to $60 to vote for Democrat candidates. When not stuffing mail-in ballots and taking advantage of voters, the operative said he and his staff impersonate voters in person on election day. The team looks for registered voters who are not active voters and obtains their personal information to impersonate them. The process, like printing fake mail-in ballots, is easy when there are no voter ID laws in place to prevent such fraud. The fake voters go to a designated polling place and sign the real voters’ signature as best as possible. The fraud often reaches the highest levels of election officials, according to the operative. His staff bends the corners of their ballots in a specific place to tip-off their allies in states’ Board of Elections. The fraud operation, detailed by this particular operative, mostly dealt with cases in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, though he suggested it occurs across the nation on a large scale. “There is no race in New Jersey — from City Council to United States Senate — that we haven’t worked on,” the operative told the New York Post. “I worked on a fire commissioner’s race in Burlington County. The smaller the race the easier it is to do.” Such alleged fraud has come to light in recent months. In June, a Democrat councilman and Democrat councilman-elect in Paterson, New Jersey, were charged with election fraud along with two Democrat operatives. In one instance, officials allege that one of the operatives collected unsealed mail-in ballots from voters and delivered them sealed to the Board of Elections. Similarly, in May, a former Pennsylvania judge pleaded guilty to stuffing ballot boxes for Democrats in exchange for payments from political operatives in 2014, 2015, and 2016 primary elections.  That same month, Pennsylvania election officials admitted that duplicate mail-in ballots were sent to voters. Nevada’s June primary shows huge issues with mail-in voting. In Las Vegas, Nevada, more than 223,000 mail-in ballots were deemed “undeliverable” in the election — about 17 percent of the total number of mail-in ballots sent out to voters, unsolicited. Federal election data reveals that since 2012, about 28.4 million mail-in ballots have gone missing in each of the last four election cycles. According to Pew Research Center analysis, there are potentially 24 million ineligible or inaccurate voter registrations on state voter rolls. Recent data has not shown a compelling public health justification for mail-in voting. In Wisconsin’s April election, only 52 of more than 400,000 voters and poll workers were confirmed to have contracted the Chinese coronavirus. None of those cases were fatal. This equals an infection rate below two-hundredths of one percent."
Democrats Unify To Gaslight Portland Murder Of Patriot… Death Blamed On Trump,31 AUG 2020,7253,"In a sickening and disgustingly insulting act, democrats joined together to spew the same gaslit claims that the Trump supporter murdered in Portland on Saturday night was not the result of their lack of law and order (and subsequent support of violent insurrectionists in the city), but instead the result of Donald Trump being president. Joe Biden, Oregon Governor Kate Brown, and a number of others all blamed the violent killing on the president, despite the fact that President Trump has repeatedly offered to quell the illegal criminal takeover of democrat cities, while the same democrat leaders push to defund the very police officers needed to stop the violence. Breitbart News reported: Former Vice President Joe Biden issued a statement Sunday afternoon in which he blamed President Donald Trump for “incitement” that led to the shooting death of an apparent Trump supporter in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday evening. Jay Bishop, wearing a “Patriot Prayer” hat who reportedly participated in a caravan of Trump supporters through downtown Portland earlier Saturday evening was shot and killed on the street. Left-wing demonstrators later celebrated his killing. Biden issued a statement condemning violence “whether on the left or the right,” and blaming Trump for “incitement”: We must not become a country at war with ourselves. A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another. But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are. As a country, we must condemn the incitement of hate and resentment that led to this deadly clash. It is not a peaceful protest when you out go out spoiling for a fight. What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters? He is recklessly encouraging violence. He may believe that tweeting about law and order makes him strong — but his failure to call on supporters to stop seeking violence shows just how weak he is. Here’s @JoeBiden‘s statement on the violence in Portland: “All of us are less safe because Donald Trump can’t do the job of the American president.” I would expect Biden to deliver this message on TV sooner rather than later. pic.twitter.com/RA8UHQ27xN — Kevin Robillard (@Robillard) August 30, 2020 Biden did not cite any specific statement or action by the president other than tweeting about “law and order.” Notably, Biden has campaigned on a false claim that Trump praised neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, whom Trump “condemned totally.” Biden has also said that he would “beat the hell out of Trump” if they were in high school. He was widely criticized for failing to condemn rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, until lives were lost last week. Breitbart News reported on Kate Brown’s laughable statement: Brown’s comments came after months of inaction by local authorities to wrangle violent protests across the city of Portland under Mayor Ted Wheeler. “For the last several years, and escalating in recent months, President Trump has encouraged division and stoked violence,” Brown said. “It happened in Charlottesville. It happened in Kenosha. And now, unfortunately, it is happening in Portland, Oregon.” “But despite the President’s jeers and tweets, this is a matter of life and death,” Brown added. “Whether it’s his completely incompetent response to the pandemic, where nearly 200,000 have died, or his outright encouragement of violence in our streets: it should be clear to everyone by now that no one is truly safe with Donald Trump as President.” Brown continued, noting that she has “supported” peaceful protests in the state. “Throughout this pandemic, whether it was demonstrations protesting my COVID-19 executive orders, or large crowds marching for the cause of Black Lives Matter to call for police reform, I have supported the rights of all Oregonians to peacefully protest.” “For months this summer, we have seen powerful images of Oregonians uniting for the cause of racial justice, calling for justice for black men and women who have been killed by police violence,” Brown stated. “We remember them, we say their names. George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. Philando Castile. Alton Sterling. And far too many other Black lives taken by racist violence.” “For weeks, we have also seen small groups of demonstrators from all ends of the political spectrum who are intent on committing acts of vandalism and violence,” Brown continued. Brown concluded her anti-Trump message by claiming the state would find who was “responsible” for the murder and hold them “accountable.” “Tragically, yesterday a life was lost in downtown Portland,” Brown added. “We do not yet know the full circumstances of this person’s death. Regardless, a life has been lost, and our hearts go out to this person’s family. We will find those who were responsible, and they will be held accountable.” … Protests across Portland for the past few months have been mostly anti-police. One group took to the streets to burn the American flag and copies of the Bible. Another group set ablaze a severed pig’s head, donned with a cop hat sitting atop an American flag. The Hill reported on Rep. Val Demmings, who added a bit of originality, claiming that it was the ‘politization’ of Homeland Security: On Sunday called the shooting death during violent clashes between pro-Trump and leftist demonstrators in Portland, Ore., “what happens” as a result of homeland security becoming “politicized.” “This is exactly what happens when homeland security, the intelligence community, the military who are charged with protecting our homeland, are politicized,” Demings, the former chief of police in Orlando, Fla., said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Demings also called on President Trump to directly address protesters in Portland to alleviate tensions. “Wouldn’t it be nice for the president of the United States to take to the microphone or the airwaves and send a message for peace and calm?” she asked. “This now more than ever is a time when we need to hear from the president of the United States,” Demings added. “But the chaos and disorder and lawlessness we are currently seeing, that’s Donald Trump’s America.” Demings also said Trump “is not capable of fulfilling his duties,” adding that “his primary responsibility is the health, safety and well-being of the American people.” Asked whether the protests themselves had gotten out of hand, Demings responded that while protesters had the right to peaceably assemble, “anyone on any side in any place who violates the law has to be held accountable.” [Except democrats, of course.] “We don’t condemn those who are obeying the law because of those who do not obey the law,” she said. “We can do both, and we have done both.” Have recent #Protests gotten out of hand? @RepValDemings says “In America, we know that demonstrators have the right to demonstrate guaranteed by the First Amendment,” but she reiterates, “We are a nation of laws” and any violation of the law has to be held accountable pic.twitter.com/tWLuydikKC — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) August 30, 2020"
"39 Missing Children Rescued, Nine Criminals Arrested In “Operation Not Forgotten”",28 AUG 2020,3105,"Thanks to a joint law enforcement effort that involved federal, state, and local officials (who democrats would like to defund), 39 missing children have been rescued and nine criminals arrested. “Operation Not Forgotten” was conducted around the Atlanta and Macon Georgia areas. WGXA Reported: The operation was made with joint efforts from The U.S. Marshals Service Missing Child Unit (USMS), in conjunction with the agency’s Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Georgia state and local agencies. The operation was two-weeks long and was conducted in August. Efforts led to the rescue of 26 children, the safe location of 13 children and the arrest of nine criminal associates. Investigators also cleared 26 arrest warrants and filed additional charges for alleged crimes related to sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs and weapons possession, and custodial interference. According to a press release of the 26 warrants cleared this included 19 arrest warrants for a total of nine individuals arrested “The U.S. Marshals Service is fully committed to assisting federal, state, and local agencies with locating and recovering endangered missing children, in addition to their primary fugitive apprehension mission,” said Director of the Marshals Service Donald Washington. “The message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you.” The missing children found were deemed to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child’s location in person and assure their safety and welfare. “When we track down fugitives, it’s a good feeling to know that we’re putting the bad guy behind bars. But that sense of accomplishment is nothing compared to finding a missing child,” said Darby Kirby, Chief of the Missing Child Unit. “It’s hard to put into words what we feel when we rescue a missing child, but I can tell you that this operation has impacted every single one of us out here. We are working to protect them and get them the help they need.” This initiative was the culmination of several months of planning and coordination between the USMS, NCMEC, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation held a press conference on August 27 to announce the success of the operation. Assist. Director John Melvin discussed the operation and stated that “Evil exists – To address it requires leadership that will identify it, call it out and deploy the necessary resources to end the problem and clean up the mess.” B-roll of “Operation Not Forgotten” can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/d0dmhirspqtht5x/Operation%20Not%20Forgotten%20B-roll.mp4?dl=0 Photos of Operation Not Forgotten (open in Google Chrome):

"Florida Judge Sides With Teacher’s Union, Preventing State From Reopening Schools",27 AUG 2020,4273,"In Florida, a major teacher’s union got a victory from the courts when a judge ruled that the state can’t order the mandatory reopening of in person learning in the state. The Epoch Times reported: A Florida judge ruled against the state’s order that required schools to open for in-person education amid the CCP virus pandemic, siding with a major Florida teachers union that wants local districts to decide. Shortly following the judge’s decision, the state filed a notice of appeal, which puts the judge’s decision on hold. Florida’s Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran issued an emergency order in early July (pdf) mandating that all physical schools in the state will have to reopen campuses by the end of August for at least 5 days a week, and follow guidelines set by the Florida Department of Health. The temporary order applies only to the upcoming fall semester, and gave the harder-hit south Florida counties of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach an exception, allowing them to start the school year with virtual learning until at least Sept. 30. The order also gave space for virtual classes, saying, “Although it is anticipated that most students will return to full-time brick and mortar schools, some parents will continue their child’s education through innovative learning environments, often due to the medical vulnerability of the child or another family member who resides in the same household.” But Judge Charles Dodson in the Circuit Court in Tallahassee sided with the Florida Education Association (FEA)—Florida’s largest teacher’s union—which had alleged that the mandate was “unsafe.” The order was issued after a 3-day trial that ended on Aug. 21, following a lawsuit that the FEA filed (pdf), which was joined by the NAACP and the NAACP Florida State Conference. In a decision (pdf) on Monday, Dodson granted a temporary injunction that adjusted the Florida Department of Education’s emergency order, to “allow local school boards to make safety determinations for the reopening of schools without financial penalty.” Dodson wrote that the state’s order is “unconstitutional to the extent that it arbitrarily disregards safety, denies local school boards’ decision making with respect to reopening brick and mortar schools, and conditions funding on an approved reopening plan with a start date in August.” “Schools should reopen when the local decision makers determine upon advice of medical experts that it is safe to do so,” Dodson wrote. He also wrote that local school boards do not have to offer the “full panoply of services” and cannot be withheld funding by the state for not doing so. The FEA praised the court’s ruling on Monday. “This is only a temporary injunction, but we plan to press ahead in court. Local communities should have the freedom to make the best decisions for reopening or keeping open local schools. Our districts should not be ruled by reckless edicts from on high. Safety must come before politics,”  FEA President Fedrick Ingram said in a statement. Later on Monday, the state filed a notice of appeal (pdf) which automatically puts a hold on Dodson’s order until the appeal is over or unless the court rules differently. Corcoran told media outlets in a statement that he is confident the state will win the lawsuit. “This fight has been, and will continue to be, about giving every parent, every teacher, and every student a choice, regardless of what educational option they choose,” Corcoran told NPR in a statement. “If you are one of the 1.6 million students who have chosen to return to the classroom, a parent, or a classroom teacher that wanted to educate their student in person, we strongly encourage you to call the Florida Education Association and tell them to drop this frivolous lawsuit.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Corcoran have said repeatedly that all schools must open, but the decision for student in-person attendance would be up to the parents. Most states closed down schools around March in a bid to curb the spread of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, a novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19. Many schools provided online teaching courses for the remainder of the year, and some schools allowed for graduations that adhered to social-distancing guidelines."
Stabbed And Shot By Illegal ‘Immigrant’: Body Cam Footage Shows Terrorist Attack On NYPD Officers,27 AUG 2020,4429,"The illegal immigrant who decided to take advantage of the COVID ‘crisis’ to kill police officers in New York by stabbing one in the neck and shooting them with their own firearm has been indicted. Recently released body cam footage of the incident shows the vile, heinous and cowardly attack. https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1298712295430696961?s=03 Citizen Free Press reported: An indictment was returned today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Dzenan Camovic with robbery and firearms offenses for his June 3, 2020 knife and firearm attack on multiple New York City Police Department (NYPD) police officers in Brooklyn. As set forth in the court filings, the defendant, a Bosnian national in the United States illegally, was motivated to attack the officers because of his interest in and support for violent Islamist extremism. “Dzenan Camovic, an illegal alien and Bosnian national, is alleged to have used the cover of chaos during recent civil unrest in New York City to launch a premeditated and cowardly attack from behind against two New York City Police officers, brutally slashing one with a knife, stealing his weapon and opening fire, and injuring several responding officers,” stated Attorney General Barr. “We know that Camovic repeatedly yelled, ‘Allahu Akbar’ during his attack. “We know that he possessed a significant volume of materials that demonstrates his interest in and support for violent Islamist extremism, including materials related to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). But the defendant’s access to the dark web and his use of encrypted communication platforms has created evidentiary roadblocks to fully learning his plans and who he discussed them with. This is the second violent Islamist extremist attack on our land in the last nine months where the attacker used encrypted technology that can help cover his tracks and mask his communications. If not for the heroism and bravery of the responding NYPD officers who returned fire and took the assailant down early in the attack, untold additional officers and innocents could have been killed or injured. “As we have alleged in the indictment and set forth in related filings, just before midnight on June 3, 2020, the defendant launched a surprise attack on police officers standing post on the streets of Brooklyn, nearly ending their lives. After stabbing a police officer in the neck, the defendant ripped a 9mm service pistol away from an officer and shot at the officers while perversely invoking religion,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney DuCharme. “Our society has never tolerated this type of behavior, and today’s federal charges will ensure Mr. Camovic isn’t a threat to society again,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. On the evening of June 3, 2020, in the midst of a public health emergency and while New York City was under a nightly curfew order, the defendant allegedly carried out his attack on NYPD police officers who were assigned to an anti-looting post near the intersection of Flatbush and Church Avenues in Brooklyn, New York. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Camovic walked past two uniformed police officers on foot patrol and appeared to crouch for several minutes watching them. Security footage shows that Camovic then moved around the block in an apparent effort to approach the two police officers from behind. At approximately 11:50 p.m., Camovic rounded the corner from Flatbush Avenue onto Church Avenue and stabbed one of the officers (“Officer 1”) in the neck with a knife. After stabbing the first officer (“Officer 1”), Camovic chased the second officer (“Officer 2”), lunging at him and attempting to stab him. Camovic then ran back to Officer 1, attacked him, forcibly took control of Officer 1’s firearm and fired multiple shots at Officer 2 and other officers who had responded to the scene. Responding officers ultimately shot Camovic and took him into custody. Several officers were wounded during Camovic’s attack and robbery, including Officer 2 who was shot in the hand. During his attack on the police officers, Camovic repeatedly shouted “Allahu Akbar,” a common Arabic phrase meaning “God is the greatest,” that has been used by perpetrators of violent jihadist terror attacks during the commission of violent attacks. The government’s investigation has revealed that, prior to the attack, Camovic possessed a significant volume of radical jihadist propaganda."
Dem States Under Investigation As DOJ Goes After “Nursing Home” COVID Death Scandal,27 AUG 2020,5806,"In a move that many people are cheering, the Justice Department has opened a preliminary inquiry into the practice of four (democrat controlled) states that deliberately put COVID patients in nursing homes, resulting in thousands of deaths. The New York Post reported: The US Justice Department has opened a preliminary inquiry into the coronavirus nursing home policies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan that it says “may have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elderly nursing home residents.” The Justice Dept. release says the state “required nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients to their vulnerable populations, often without adequate testing.” The Justice Dept. particularly honed in on Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker’s controversial March 25 order that required nursing homes accept recovering COVID-19 residents discharged from hospitals while barring the facilities from screening them for the killer bug. The release even quotes from New York’s order which stated: “No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to [a nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. [Nursing homes] are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” Cuomo rescinded the March 25 nursing home order after facing a firestorm of criticism. “Protecting the rights of some of society’s most vulnerable members, including elderly nursing home residents, is one of our country’s most important obligations. We must ensure they are adequately cared for with dignity and respect and not unnecessarily put at risk,” said Eric Dreiban, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. State Health Department data says there’s been 6,453 confirmed or presumed nursing home deaths from COVID-19. Critics point out that figure does not include potentially thousands of nursing home residents who contracted the virus and were transported to hospitals and died. An Associated Press analysis found that number could be closer to 11,000. The state Health Department issued its own internal report which claimed its nursing home order was not the cause of deaths of nursing home residents. The report claimed that infected nursing home staffers and family/visitors unknowingly spread the virus to the frail and elderly residents. Critics panned the report as self-serving and incomplete. [Nurses were outraged over the ‘report.] One Democratic lawmaker Wednesday hailed the federal inquiry. “It’s the right thing to do. We need to know if any of the policies contributed to the deaths of 6,400 nursing home residents,” said Queens Assemblyman Ron Kim. “What happened to nursing home residents is a human right violation.” The Justice Department is evaluating whether to initiate a full investigation under the federal “Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act” (CRIPA), which protects the rights of residents in “state-run nursing homes, among others.” Justice’s Civil Rights Division seeks to determine if the state orders requiring admission of COVID-19 patients to nursing homes is “responsible for the deaths of nursing home residents,” the release said. In its release, the Justice Department noted New York’s top-in-the-nation deaths from the coronavirus — 32,592 overall.  New York has the second highest death rate in in the country per population, with 1,680 deaths per million people. New Jersey’s death rate of 1,733 deaths per million people is the highest per capita in the nation. In contrast, Texas reported just over 11,000 deaths, though its population is 50 percent larger than New York and has many more recorded cases of COVID-19. Cuomo and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a joint statement Wednesday evening accusing the Trump Justice Department of playing partisan politics with nursing homes and the COVID-19 crisis. “This is nothing more than a transparent politicization of the Department of Justice in the middle of the Republican National Convention. It’s no coincidence the moment the Trump administration is caught weakening the CDC’s COVID-19 testing guidelines to artificially lower the number of positive cases, they launched this nakedly partisan deflection,” Cuomo and Whitmer said. “At least 14 states — including Kentucky, Utah and Arizona — have issued similar nursing guidance all based on federal guidelines and yet the four states listed in the DOJ’s request have a Democratic governor. DOJ should send a letter to CMS (Center for Medicare Services) and CDC since the State’s advisories were modeled after their guidance.” Cuomo, who has said COVID-19 spread through nursing homes “like fire through dry grass,”  has long maintained that New York was following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control in transferring coronavirus patients from hospitals to nursing homes. But White House and federal health officials have disputed that claim. Cuomo has also opposed calls for an independent probe of nursing home deaths, saying state and congressional legislative hearings were adequate. One federal health official applauded the Justice Department inquiry. “For months, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been ducking his personal responsibility for ordering the seeding of New York nursing homes with the coronavirus, a tragic mistake which killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers,” said Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Michael Caputo, who hails from Western New York. “He’s shifted blame, he even tried to clear himself with a crony inquiry nobody in the nation took seriously. Thankfully, a federal investigation has begun, far from the dark and cynical manipulations of the second floor of the New York State Capitol.” Read the DOJ release here.  "
"Cuban American Nails It, Warns Americans Of “Empty Promises” Of Socialism, Biden",25 AUG 2020,2354,"Last night, during the Republican National Convention, Florida businessman Maximo Alvarez warned voters about the “empty promises” of socialism. Fox News reported: Alvarez, the founder of Sunshine Gasoline Distributors, fled Cuba with his parents at the age of 13 as Fidel Castro and his communist regime took control of the island. Speaking in support of President Trump, an emotional Alvarez alleged that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is “mostly concerned about power” and would allow socialist policies to take hold in America. “I’ve seen movements like this before. I’ve seen ideas like this before. I am here to tell you – we cannot let them take over our country,” Alvarez said. “I heard the promises of Fidel Castro. And I can never forget all those who grew up around me, who looked like me, who suffered and starved and died because they believed those empty promises. They swallowed the communist poison pill.” Alvarez argued that policies favored by prominent Democrats, such as free health care, and calls to defund the police are “false promises” that “sound familiar” based on his experiences in Cuba. The Trump administration has accused Biden and running mate Kamala Harris of embracing far-left policies in their platform. Officials in several Democrat-run cities have pushed to cut funding for local police forces in recent months amid nationwide protests against systemic racism. Biden has repeatedly denied that he plans to defund police departments, stating instead that he intends to crack down on misconduct and provide support for better practices. In his speech, Alvarez said recent violence in cities around the country stirred memories of his homeland. “The country I was born in is gone, totally destroyed,” Alvarez said. “When I watch the news in Seattle and Chicago and Portland, when I see history being rewritten, when I hear the promises—I hear echoes of a former life I never wanted to hear again. I see shadows I thought I had outrun.” Alvarez said he is “grateful” that he was “able to build my American dream through hard work and determination.” “President Trump is fighting the forces of anarchy and communism. And now he will continue to do just that. And what about his opponent and the rest of the DC swamp?  I have no doubt they will hand the country over to those dangerous forces,” Alvarez said."
"Video Shows Blake Fighting Police Before Shooting, History of Predatory Behavior Exposed",25 AUG 2020,5571,"Jacob Blake, the black man shot by Wisconsin police, apparently fought them immediately before the shooting, according to newly found cell phone video footage. Moreover, new information shows that Blake is a serial criminal who may have been armed during the altercation. Breitbart News reported: Cell phone footage shows Jacob Blake entangled in a physical scuffle with police prior to being shot as he ignored officers’ warnings and reached inside his car. The new video was published by the Daily Mail, which describes Blake “wrestling with at least two Kenosha officers” immediately before the shooting. Local news in Wisconsin reports that Blake was charged by Kenosha County prosecutors prior to his altercation with the police on accusations of sexual assault, trespassing, and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant had been issued on July 7th, although it is unclear if the encounter with police officers that led to his shooting was linked to that warrant. Blake had a history of resisting arrest, having previously done so when officers attempted to arrest him following an incident in which he pulled a gun on bar patrons in Racine, a town just north of Kenosha, in 2015. The shooting of Blake and subsequent hospitalization has led to a second outbreak of riots, looting, and violence in American cities, with the epicenter in Kenosha itself, a county that voted for Donald Trump by a slim margin in 2016. 150 members of the Wisconsin National Guard have been deployed to Kenosha, although rioters appear to be undaunted, continuing to lay waste to vehicles and local businesses for the second night in a row. A closer look at just one of the buildings (the local furniture store) currently up in flames in Kenosha tonight: pic.twitter.com/2EvasISbN1 — Shelby Talcott (@ShelbyTalcott) August 25, 2020 The Democrat governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, called the shooting an “attack against a Black man” and claimed, “racism is a public health crisis.” As our state reels from another attack against a Black man, as communities grieve and exercise their first amendment rights to demand justice, and as Jacob Blake fights for his life— we are reminded that racism is a public health crisis. There is no time to waste. — Governor Tony Evers (@GovEvers) August 24, 2020 On the day of the shooting, Gov. Evers said that he “stand[s] against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites,” despite admitting that “we do not have all of the details yet.” Blake was apparently wanted on sexual assault charges as well. Breitbart News reported: Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old black man shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, was wanted on charges of sexual assault, among others, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported Monday: Online court records indicate Kenosha County prosecutors charged Blake on July 6 with third-degree sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant was issued for Blake the following day. The records contain no further details and do not list an attorney for Blake. Another article from 2015 describes a Jacob Blake, aged 24, who had to be subdued by a police dog after he resisted arrest following an armed altercation in a bar. The Racine County Eye reported: Jacob Blake, 24, of Racine, was charged Monday in Racine County Circuit Court with one felony count of resisting arrest causing a soft tissue injury to a police officer and one misdemeanor count each of carrying a concealed weapon, carrying a firearm while intoxicated, endangering safety-use of a dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct. If convicted, he will face up to 8-1/2 years in prison and/or up to $50,000 in fines. According to the criminal complaint, Blake and two women were at the Brass Monkey tavern, 1436 Junction Avenue, Saturday when Blake got into an argument with another patron and pulled a black handgun. Blake pointed the gun at the other man, and the magazine fell to the floor. The bartender told Blake to leave, and he did but then pointed the gun through the window at patrons inside the bar before walking south on Junction Avenue. Police say they encountered a woman walking on Junction who was in the bar with Blake, but she said she didn’t know what happened and that her friends left without her in a silver SUV. A few moments later, officers were advised that a silver SUV was traveling north on Junction with a male subject driving who matched the description of Blake, and they initiated a traffic stop in the 1200 block of Racine Avenue. Believing the driver was armed, police conducted a high risk traffic stop, the complaint reads, and ordered Blake to put his hands out the window of the vehicle. Instead, Blake exited the SUV and started walking toward officers and ignored commands to get down on the ground. Officers forced Blake to the ground and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. When Blake refused to comply, K9 Dozer was deployed to force the defendant into compliance. Breitbart News attempted to confirm that the same individual was involved in both altercations. The telephone line of the Racine police department was busy. Blake was shot several times on Sunday evening after walking away from police officers, who had reportedly attempted to subdue him with a Taser, and reaching inside a vehicle. Riots, looting, and arson erupted in the aftermath. The National Guard were deployed to Racine on Monday and an 8 p.m. curfew has been imposed on part of Kenosha County."
New Jersey Election Re-Do Ordered After 22% Of Mail-In Ballots Were Frauds,24 AUG 2020,2904,"Many people argue that democrats know they can’t win unless they cheat. Apparently, that opinion is being backed up by actual democrat election fraud. In New Jersey, a new election has been ordered after nearly 225 pf the vote was compromised by fraudulent mail-in ballots. The Daily Caller reported: A state superior court judge ruled Wednesday that a new election will be held for a disputed Paterson, New Jersey city council seat after allegations of voter fraud via mail-in-ballots. The ruling comes only weeks after voter fraud charges were brought against the May 12 election winner Alex Mendez, per the Associated Press. Mendez was charged with voter fraud along with Paterson Council Vice President Michael Jackson, Shelim Khalique and Abu Rayzen — all of whom have denied the charges, according to The Hill. An investigation performed by the U.S. Postal Service’s law enforcement arm found hundreds of mail-in ballots in a Paterson mailbox, as reported by the AP. Ultimately, 800 ballots were discounted by the Passaic County Board of Elections and another 2,300 ballots were rendered ineligible after analyzing signatures on file and comparing them to those on the ballots, according to the Hill. A Passaic County report shows that these 3,100 disqualified ballots is equal to more than 22% of the total votes cast in the election. A June press release from the office of the New Jersey attorney general quoted Attorney General Grewal, saying, “Today’s charges send a clear message: if you try to tamper with an election in New Jersey, we will find you and we will hold you accountable. We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public’s confidence in our democratic process.” An attorney for Mendez’ opponent Councilman William McKoy swiftly obtained an injunction that prevented Mendez from taking McKoy’s seat and being sworn in, reports The Hill. The local race has garnered national attention amid the political battle regarding nationwide mail-in voting for the upcoming presidential election. President Donald Trump made reference to the Paterson election in a tweet attacking mail-in voting. The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place, & everyone knows it. So much time is taken talking about foreign influence, but the same people won’t even discuss Mail-In election corruption. Look at Patterson, N.J. 20% of vote was corrupted! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2020 The Trump campaign is suing New Jersey over Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order adopting a hybrid voting model for this November, as reported by CNN on Wednesday. Murphy responded Wednesday at a press conference. “The President’s campaign is putting itself on record as wanting to delegitimize our November election instead of working with us to ensure that voters rights are upheld alongside public health,” Murphy said."
"First Speech Fact Check: Kamala Tells Multiple Lies, Media Silent",14 AUG 2020,2312,"In her first speech as Joe Biden’s ‘choice’ for VP, Kamala Harris told multiple whoppers with a straight face, proving yet again that many democrats really don’t have the ability to tell the truth. The National Review reported: “The president’s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,” Harris said. False. The pandemic and its associated lockdowns, not the president, are responsible for the economic contraction. Donald Trump is not the president of the euro zone, which suffered through an even more dire economic contraction in the second quarter: minus 40.3 percent, on an annualized basis, as against minus 32.9 percent in the US. The U.K. suffered a contraction of 59.8 percent, also on an annualized basis. Donald Trump is not the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The U.S. economy did slightly better than Germany’s in the second quarter. And it’s questionable to compare the current crisis to the Great Depression, which was not only deep but lasted more than a decade. The U.S. added 1.8 million jobs in July and Goldman Sachs predicts 25 percent (annualized) GDP growth in the current third quarter, which would mark an end to the U.S. recession after two quarters. “Just look where [Trump and Mike Pence] have gotten us. . . . Millions of kids who cannot go back to school,” Harris said. Wrong. It is not Donald Trump’s decision whether kids go back to school, because the federal government does not run schools, but he has urged the schools to reopen. The primary reason kids cannot go back to school is opposition from teachers’ unions. The second-largest teachers’ union is threatening to strike if schools reopen. “Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis,” Harris said. “It was called Ebola. We all remember that pandemic.” Incorrect. Ebola was an outbreak, not a pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. “This virus has impacted almost every country,” Harris said. “But there’s a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It’s because of Trump’s failure to take it seriously.” Wrong. Several advanced nations have suffered more fatalities per million population than the U.S.: Belgium, the U.K., Spain, Italy, Sweden. Donald Trump is not in charge of any of these countries."
SCOTUS Rules In Democrat “Witnesses” Fight For Rhode Island Mail In Ballots,14 AUG 2020,5061,"Why would democrats fight so hard to remove the regulations and protections that ensure election integrity unless they plan to cheat as much as possible to steal the 2020 election? Many people know the answer to this question, but apparently, the Supreme Court does not. SCOTUS ruled against conservatives who were trying to stop the fraud push in Rhode Island, allowing that state to scrap legitimate protections against voter fraud. The Houston Chronical reported: The Supreme Court on Thursday rebuffed the Republican Party and allowed a consent decree to go forward so that Rhode Island voters during the coronavirus pandemic could cast mail-in ballots without in-person witness verification. It was the first time the justices had agreed to a pandemic-related voter relief effort. But they explained in a short, unsigned order that state officials had agreed to relax the rules, and the change already had been implemented during the June primary. Unlike “similar cases where a state defends its own law, here the state election officials support the challenged decree, and no state official has expressed opposition,” the order said. “Under these circumstances, the applicants lack a cognizable interest in the state’s ability to enforce its duly enacted laws.” The vote was not announced, but Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch noted that they would have granted the stay requested by the Republican National Committee and the state Republican Party. Thursday’s ruling comes as President Donald Trump, who is trailing his Democratic challenger in nationwide polls, continues to impugn mail-in voting. He and his political allies have said it is susceptible to large-scale fraud, though there is scant evidence to suggest that is true. [Actually, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that is true. Over the past months, a large number of democrats have been indicted for ballot stuff and other voter fraud, and Judicial Watch has proven case after case concerning the fraudulent rolls states refuse to clean up, despite the law.] Throughout the coronavirus crisis, when dealing with cases involving voting, prison conditions and gatherings such as religious services, the court has consistently sided with local officials rather than those who sought court relief. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. laid out his reasoning for that in one of the cases brought by a church objecting to California’s pandemic restrictions. Local officials “should not be subject to second-guessing by an ‘unelected federal judiciary,’ which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people,” he wrote, quoting a court precedent. Rhode Island requires voters mailing their ballots to sign them in front of two witnesses or a notary. But Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo suspended that requirement for the June primary because of worries that it would expose voters to the virus. This summer, the legislature failed to reach agreement on a bill that would extend that accommodation to elections in September and November. Groups including Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union sued, and state officials agreed in a consent decree not to enforce the witness requirement. Then Republicans sued. They said the state had a history of fraud involving mail-in voting, and that state officials must use the political, not judicial, process to make changes. “The problems with federal courts enjoining valid state laws on the eve of elections do not go away just because some state defendants like the injunction,” wrote Thomas McCarthy, a lawyer for the Republicans. “A federal court has no power to enter a consent judgment that enjoins a state law unless that law is likely unconstitutional.” The Republican request to the Supreme Court came after a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit denied the GOP’s challenge to U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy’s decision to allow the consent decree. “The consent decree reflects the considered judgment of Rhode Island election officials that, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, voters should not have to face a choice between their health and their fundamental right to vote,” the groups suing for the change told the Supreme Court. Since the witness requirement was not used in the June primary, the Supreme Court’s order said, “many Rhode Island voters may well” believe it is not required for future elections. John Marion, executive director, Common Cause Rhode Island, said the organization is “thrilled that the Supreme Court agreed not to stay the consent decree. Because of this order hundreds of thousands of Rhode Island voters will be able to safely cast their ballots without risking their health.” The case is Republican National Committee v. Common Cause. Rhode Island is one of two states with such extensive witness requirements. The other is Alabama. The Supreme Court put on hold a judicial order granting similar relief in that state, where state officials had defended its need."
Historic! “Diplomatic Breakthrough” President Trump Negotiates Middle East Peace Agreement,14 AUG 2020,15198,"In a stunning announcement last night, President Trump announced that a “historic” peace agreement had been brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. The announcement brings the tally of President Trump’s accomplishments for global peace into record territory, making many people wonder just what the heck previous administrations were doing… other than apparently working for China. Fox News reported: “HUGE breakthrough today! Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates!” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. The president, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed released a joint statement Thursday, after the three spoke “and agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.” The statement said that the “diplomatic breakthrough” was at “the request of President Trump,” and that Israel will “suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President’s Vision for Peace and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world.” Israel and the UAE also said they will continue their efforts to “achieve a just, comprehensive and enduring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” “This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,” the statement read. “All three countries face many common challenges and will mutually benefit from today’s historic achievement.” Delegations from Israel and the UAE are expected to meet in the coming weeks to “sign bilateral agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit.” “Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East’s most dynamic societies and advanced economies will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations,” the statement also read. Trump on Thursday said he had a call with Israel and the United Arab Emirates. The president told reporters Israel and the UAE will “begin cooperation across the board,” along with exchanging embassies and ambassadors. The president said he expected other countries to follow the UAE’s lead on this effort to cooperate with Israel going forward. The president said the action would be known as the “Abraham Accord,” named for the “father of all three great faiths.” “No person better symbolizes the potential for unity of these three great faiths,” U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said from the Oval Office Thursday. The president went on to joke that he “wanted to call it the Donald J. Trump accord,” which received laughs in the room. “I didn’t do that,” Trump added, again touting the historic importance of the agreement. “We are already discussing this with other nations,” Trump said. “So, you will probably see others of these.” The president went on to cheer his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner for his efforts in securing the agreement. “The president, like with all things, urged us to take an untraditional approach,” Kushner said Thursday. “You can’t solve problems that have gone unsolved the way people have done before you and failed.” Kushner said the president “tries to unite people focusing on common interest as opposed to common grievances.” “We were able to achieve results others could not achieve,” Kushner said. “This will advance the region and advance the world.” Meanwhile, Israel’s ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer tweeted shortly after the agreement was announced saying: “A great day for peace! Israel commends the courage of MBZ for the historic decision of the UAE to join Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994) in making peace with Israel. Israel deeply appreciates all. @POTUS Trump has done to make this breakthrough possible. More to come!” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo touted the “vigorous diplomatic outreach” by the president, Israel and the UAE. “The United States congratulates Israel and the Emirates for this remarkable achievement, which is a significant step forward for peace in the Middle East. Blessed are the peacemakers. Mabruk and Mazal Tov,” Pompeo tweeted. The Jerusalem Post reported: Israel and the UAE agreed to full normalization of relations in a phone call with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, marking the first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country in 25 years. Israel agreed to suspend its planned extension of sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria to facilitate relations with the UAE and potentially other Arab and Muslim countries. The agreement will include establishing embassies and exchanging ambassadors, investments into the Israeli economy, trade, direct flights between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi, an investment in Israeli efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine – as first reported in The Jerusalem Post last month – and cooperation in matters of energy and water. An important element of the deal for the UAE is the expectation that its citizens would be able to visit the Al-Aksa mosque in Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the deal “full, formal peace” with “one of the strongest countries in the world.” “Together we can bring a wonderful future. It is an incomparably exciting moment,” Netanyahu said. “I have the great privilege to make the third peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country, the UAE.” Netanyahu wished Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohamed bin Zayed “Salam Aleykum v’Shalom Aleynu – peace unto you and peace unto us.” Trump said in a statement posted to his twitter account: “Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East’s most dynamic societies and advanced economies will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations.” In subsequent remarks in the Oval Office, Trump alluded to “many more countries” in the region normalizing ties with Israel, and “some very exciting things including, ultimately with the Palestinians.” Netanyahu said he has “reason to be very optimistic that today’s announcement w the UAE will be joined by more countries in this expanding circle of peace.” The agreement “ushers in a new era of peace between Israel and the Arab world,” he said. Netanyahu thanked the leaders of the Arab world for supporting the agreement on Friday, writing on his Twitter account, “I thank Egyptian President al-Sisi, and the governments of Oman and Bahrain for their support of the historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.” “The agreement expands the circle of peace and benefits the entire region,” Netanyahu wrote. אני מודה לנשיא מצרים א-סיסי, ולממשלות עומאן ובחריין על תמיכתם בהסכם השלום ההיסטורי בין ישראל לאיחוד האמירויות, שמרחיב את מעגל השלום ויטיב עם האזור כולו. — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) August 14, 2020 Sources in Washington and Jerusalem said the Trump administration is in talks with other Gulf States to reach normalization agreements with Israel. Bahrain is likely to be next, to the extent that there was a chance they would have announced normalization before the UAE. The US president also mentioned Iran, about which the UAE and other Gulf States share concerns with Israel, saying that he will make a deal with them “within 30 days” if he wins the election. Trump said the Iranians are “dying to make a deal,” but would prefer that it be with the Democratic candidate for president, Joe Biden, “because that would be like a dream” for them.  Trump’s Special Adviser Jared Kushner clarified that the deal would not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. Netanyahu remarked that the moves towards normalization were kept tightly under wraps because Iran would have liked to sabotage them. Iran has played a major role in the closer ties between Israel and Gulf States since the previous US government and other world powers signed the nuclear deal with Tehran in 2015. The countries began cooperating on national security and that moved to other issues after trust was built between them, to the point that an American source said normalization seemed inevitable. As a reaction, Iran’s Foreign Minister declared to the state news agency IRNA that the deal was “dangerous and illegitimate.” He said that “this is stabbing the Palestinians in the back and will strengthen the regional unity against the Zionist regime.” “The shameful measure of Abu Dhabi to reach an agreement with the fake Zionist regime (Israel) is a dangerous move and the UAE and other states that backed it will be responsible for its consequences,” the statement added, according to IRNA. Netanyahu touted a formula of “peace for peace,” based on shared interests, emphasizing economic cooperation, and peace that comes from a position of strength, rather than peace in exchange for concessions. However, bin Zayed presented the matter as though he had exacted concessions from Israel, emphasizing the suspension of sovereignty plans over normalization. He tweeted that “an agreement was reached to stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories. The UAE and Israel also agreed to cooperation and setting a roadmap towards establishing a bilateral relationship.” Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah a-Sisi similarly called it “the agreement to stop Israel’s annexation of the Palestinian Territories and taking steps to bring Peace to the Middle East.” He said in a tweet that he “values the efforts… in order to achieve prosperity and stability for our region.” The Trump administration’s “Vision for Peace” would allow Israel to apply its law to 30% of Judea and Samaria, including all settlements and the Jordan Valley. The rest of the West Bank would be designated for an eventual Palestinian state, which would receive recognition and a $50 billion aid package from the US if it meets a list of pre-conditions, including demilitarization and stopping incitement and salaries for terrorists. Netanyahu said that he still plans to apply Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. “I’m not giving up on it. It’s on the table because of me. Trump put sovereignty into his peace plan because I asked for it,” Netanyahu said. “But in the first place I said again and again that we would only implement sovereignty in coordination with the US. Without support from the US, in the best case it would be worthless, and in the worst case, it would hurt ties very much.” Netanyahu emphasized that he “did not and will not remove sovereignty from the agenda… I will never give up on our right to our land.” Diplomatic sources in Jerusalem and Washington pointed to the use of the word “suspend,” which implies that the pause is only temporary. The wording was agreed upon by all three sides. It is unclear for how long annexation would remain suspended, but it is unlikely that anything would happen before the end of this year, the Washington source said. The Trump peace team’s efforts gained steam in July and led to Israel’s decision to skip the original July 1 date that Netanyahu had discussed for sovereignty moves. The administration felt that the opportunity for Israel to normalize ties with the UAE was a “better choice.” “In the long term, this will solidify security,” one American official said. Peace between Israel and the UAE presented an opportunity for “real peace” unlike the cold peace it has with Egypt and Jordan, since Israel and the UAE were never enemies that fought a war against each other. Sovereignty moves would have stopped the momentum towards normalization with Gulf States, another source said. The American source said: “Israel was presented with two opportunities and chose one. They’re aggressively pursuing [normalization] and not complicating it by doing sovereignty.” Trump called the diplomatic breakthrough a “labor of love for a lot of people in the room,” speaking to how it is also an achievement for Special Adviser to the President Jared Kushner, who heads the Middle East peace team, and Special Representative for International Negotiations Avi Berkowitz, who worked behind the scenes in recent months to promote normalization between Israel and the Arab world, and US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Friedman said “the normalization of relations between Israel and the UAE will make Israel stronger and safer and will likely lead to additional exciting opportunities and incremental prosperity for Israel, its neighbors and the entire region.” A senior Likud source remarked that “the Israeli and international Left always said we can’t bring peace with Arab states without peace with the Palestinians, that there is no other way than withdrawing to ‘67 lines, evacuating settlements, dividing Jerusalem and establishing a Palestinian state. For the first time in history Prime Minister Netanyahu broke the paradigm of ‘land for peace’ and brought ‘peace for peace.’” Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi praised the agreement, saying “the good news of normalization with the UAE is important and an opening to more agreements.” Ashkenazi also praised “avoiding the one-sided annexation plan,” and called for the complete Trump peace plan to be implemented. Yamina leader Naftali Bennett praised the normalization, saying “relations between the countries are no longer held hostage by Palestinian recalcitrance,” but slammed Netanyahu for suspending sovereignty plans. “It’s unfortunate that Netanyahu gave up a once-in-a-century chance to apply sovereignty to the Jordan Valley, Ma’aleh Adumim, Bet El and the rest of Israeli settlements,” he said. “It is tragic that Netanyahu did not seize the moment and didn’t have the courage to apply sovereignty to a centimeter of the Land of Israel, but sovereignty over the parts of our homeland will come from somewhere else.” Joint List MK Mtanes Shihadeh accused the UAE of a “betrayal… no less than a knife in the back of the Palestinian people and the Arab nations.” Shehadeh posited that “Netanyahu and Israel never really meant to annex, but in order for him to abandon the plan, the UAE agreed to make its secret relations open. Nothing will change and anyone who thinks the Palestinians will disappear are mistaken.” Democratic candidate for president Joe Biden said “the UAE’s offer to publicly recognize the State of Israel is a welcome, brave and badly-needed act of statesmanship. Annexation would be a bloody blow to the course of peace, which is why I oppose it now and would oppose it as president.” The Gulf state of Oman said on Friday it supported the United Arab Emirates’ decision to normalize ties with Israel, saying it hoped the accord would contribute to a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in the Middle East. The statement by a foreign ministry spokesman, carried by state news agency ONA, called the UAE-Israel agreement “historic.”"
"PA Restaurants Plan ‘Protest’ Of Dem Governor’s Shut Down, “Revolution” Comes Tomorrow",13 AUG 2020,3979,"In Pennsylvania, the democrat governor has enacted some of the most severe and erroneous COVID orders, completely eliminating personal freedom in the state. But some business owners are sick and tired of losing their livelihoods over false science, and plan to revolt tomorrow. Fox News reported: Some restaurant and tavern owners in western Pennsylvania say they’re not happy with Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf’s orders limiting the number of patrons they can serve because of the coronavirus. The disgruntled business owners in Allegheny County say they plan to fight back beginning Friday with what they’re calling a “Restaurant Revolution.” Organizers are asking participating businesses to open their establishments to full capacity – instead of the 25% capacity ordered by the governor to help limit spread of the virus, Pittsburgh’s KDKA-TV reported. The group said it would otherwise adhere to recommendations set out by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as six feet of social distancing between patrons, the station reported. Organizers said they held talks with the governor’s office in Harrisburg for about a month – but claim the governor ignored a recent deadline for getting back to them with a decision, KDKA reported. Last month, Wolf announced a series of tougher restrictions in a bid to contain the spread of the virus, after state health officials reported an “unsettling” climb in new infections. “If we don’t act now, medical experts are projecting that this new surge in cases could soon eclipse the peak in April,” Wolf wrote on Twitter at the time. His new rules took effect July 16. Several state Republicans voiced opposition to what one described as the governor’s “countless, confusing orders.” This week, local elected officials and health experts in Allegheny County quickly spoke out against the restaurant owners’ planned action. “The law is the law,” Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald told KDKA. “We can’t just have people breaking the law. The state has put these restrictions in place and we support their decision.” [Wrong. These aren’t “laws.” They are offensive and unconstitutional restrictions ordered by an autocrat, removing the liberties of law abiding citizens based on false science about a ‘pandemic.’] He warned that the county’s COVID-19 task force would continue making inspections of restaurants and taverns and issue citations to violators. Der. Debra Bogen, director of the county’s health department, pleaded with the business owners to rethink their plan. “I would put out a plea: Please, please don’t do that,” she told KDKA. “It is a critical time with schools and all of our college students returning to town over the next few weeks. It is our time to focus on the return to education.” On Aug. 6, more than 100 business owners rallied in the parking lot of a restaurant in Bethel Park, calling on Wolf to ease the restrictions, KDKA reported. Across the state in Philadelphia and other parts of eastern Pennsylvania, restaurant owners said they too were frustrated by the governor’s rules but were trying to comply as best they could. “We’ve learned to just try to adapt,” Josh Divers, co-owner of a brew pub in Bethlehem, told Philadelphia’s FOX 29 last month. Meanwhile, Allegheny County health authorities ordered a Pittsburgh restaurant and nightclub called Seven to shut down for a week over allegations that it violated coronavirus rules, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported. The alleged violations included the restaurant’s employees not wearing masks, according to the outlet. Other violations included allowing patrons to sit at the bar and serving alcohol to customers who did not also order food, the report said. The restaurant also allegedly denied entry to a county health inspector until the inspector received assistance from Pittsburgh police, the report said. In addition to the weeklong shutdown, the restaurant was ordered to pay a $532 fine, according to the outlet."
"Stasi-State Wisconsin Demands Employees Wear Face Masks During Zoom Meetings, Even When Alone",13 AUG 2020,2100,"An agency, operated by the ‘state,’ in Wisconsin has ordered employees to wear face coverings during video meetings, even if they are home alone. This massive invasion of liberty is just another wrecking ball to American freedoms, and people apparently have no problem with it. Fox News reported: A Wisconsin state agency is reportedly mandating that its employees wear face masks during video conferences, even if they are home alone. In a July 31 email, the Department of Natural Resources Secretary Preston Cole reminded employees that the governor’s mask order, which requires anyone over the age of 4 to wear a face-covering while indoors, was to take effect Aug. 1, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. “Also, wear your mask, even if you are home, to participate in a virtual meeting that involves being seen — such as on Zoom or another video-conferencing platform — by non-DNR staff,” Cole said, according to the Sentinel. “Set the safety example which shows you as a DNR public service employee care about the safety and health of others.” Under the Gov. Tony Evers’ order, Wisconsinites are required to cover up when they are indoors or in an enclosed space with anyone outside their household or living unit. Face coverings are also “strongly recommended” when people are outdoors and it’s not possible to maintain physical distancing, according to a press release from the governor’s office. There are exceptions to the rule, however, such as when someone is eating, drinking, or swimming. Furthermore, individuals with health conditions or disabilities that prevent them from being able to safely wear a mask or face covering are exempt. “We need to get back to working together statewide to flatten the curve and to prevent the spread of this virus,” Evers said in July. “The most important thing you can do is serve as an example to those around you by wearing a mask or face covering, practicing physical distancing, and following best safety practice.” This is insane, especially since study after study have proven the ineffectiveness of mask to prevent the spread of infection."
Michigan Conflict Heats Up: Totalitarian Governor Claims Armed Citizens Demanding Rights Are “Disturbing”,13 AUG 2020,1993,"‘Protestors’ (aka citizens who object to their constitutional freedoms being arbitrarily destroyed, ignored, and violated) have been fighting the democrat governor of Michigan for weeks. And, because some of these law-abiding citizens are openly carrying (in order to protect themselves, no doubt), the governor has called it “disturbing.” WZZM 13 reported: For some observers, the images of armed men in tactical gear at a state Capitol were an unsettling symbol of rising tensions in a nation grappling with crisis. Others saw evidence of racial bias in the way the protesters were treated by police. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has denounced as “disturbing” the protest that occurred at the state Capitol. “Yesterday’s scene at the Capitol was disturbing, to be quite honest,” Whitmer said at a news conference Friday in Lansing. “Swastikas and Confederate flags, nooses and automatic rifles do not reflect who we are as Michiganders.” [This viewer saw no confederate flags or swastikas in the group, just angry citizens desperate to keep their liberty.] Some protesters — many without face coverings — entered the Capitol on Thursday and demanded to be let onto the House floor, which is not allowed. “I know that some people are angry. And I know many are feeling restless. I know that people are itching to get back to work. And I get it. And I respect it,” Whitmer said. “And it’s OK to feel that way. There’s nothing that I want more than to just flip the switch and return to normal. But that’s now how it’s going to work, unfortunately.” [Wrong. That’s her un-medical opinion. And, her tone and words are extremely patronizing and insulting… as if these citizens are unruly children that she has to control. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death."
China Claims Chicken Wings From Brazil Test Positive,13 AUG 2020,1490,"According to Chinese officials, food that has been imported into the country has tested ‘positive’ for coronavirus. Of course, this is the same country that has issued so many lies about the virus it unleashed on the world that they are hard to keep track of. The New York Post reported: A batch of frozen chicken wings exported from Brazil to China tested positive for coronavirus, Chinese officials announced Thursday. The infected poultry was discovered in the city of Shenzhen during routine screenings of imported meat and seafood carried out since June, the city government said in a notice. The screenings were implemented after a coronavirus outbreak in Beijing was linked to a seafood market. People who may have come into contact with the chicken wings, along with food products stored near the batch, were tested by Shenzhen’s health authorities. All those results came back negative. On Wednesday, China also reported that the coronavirus was found on packages of shrimp shipped in from Ecuador. COVID-19, which has killed over 749,000 people worldwide, was first linked to a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Whether or not this report is true is anyone’s guess. The communist country has done it’s best to lie about COVID since the beginning of the year, many people argue, so what would stop them from lying now? In fact, some people argue that this is simply a scare tactic being fabricated for the American left, in order to help push the idea of mail-in voting."
"10 Members of COVID Panel Linked To Drug, Vaccines Company",12 AUG 2020,2822,"No wonder that there is such a concerted effort to bury the fact that hydroxychloroquine is a crure for COVID-19… at least 10 members of the NIH panel are linked to the company that makes an expensive drug and a company pursuing the vaccine. Just The News reported: Members of the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel have financial ties to a company behind clinical trials of a drug to treat coronavirus, as well as to another large pharmaceutical company involved with developing a COVID-19 vaccine. According to the NIH, members of the panel include U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts who are developing treatment guidelines on COVID-19 “intended for healthcare providers.” A total of eight panel members list a financial relationship with Gilead Sciences on the panel’s Financial Disclosure for Companies Related to COVID-19 Treatment or Diagnostics document: Judith Aberg, MD, Adaora Adimora, MD, Jason Baker, MD, Roger Bedimo, MD, Eric Daar, MD, David V. Glidden, PhD, Susanna Naggie, MD, and Pablo Tebas, MD. The U.S. has reportedly bought almost all of Gilead Sciences’ supply of the COVID-19 drug remdesivir. The company announced on June 1 the results of a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug in patients with moderate COVID-19. On Monday, Gilead applied for FDA approval of remdesivir, which has been available for emergency use with patients hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19. “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), announced back on April 29 in an interview with NBC News, citing results of a large international study sponsored by his NIAID. “And all of the other trials that are taking place now have a new standard of care,” said Fauci. Dr. William O’Neill, a cardiologist and Medical Director at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Mich., told Just the News contributor Sharyl Attkisson in an interview for her news program “Full Measure” that he is less impressed with remdesivir. “There is a lot of hype for the drug,” said O’Neil, adding that he sees “no big benefit” to remdesivir after reading medical journal reports on it. Andrew T. Pavia, MD and Rajesh Gandhi, MD list Merck on the NIH disclosure form. Merck is currently conducting clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine. Merck’s target date for a licensed COVID-19 vaccine is early 2021, according to recent congressional testimony. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines are “based on published and preliminary data and the clinical expertise of the panelists, many of whom are frontline clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving pandemic.” Fauci is not listed on the NIH financial disclosure form."
Teacher Rants “Conservative” Parents Can Listen In To Indoctrination Sessions,11 AUG 2020,6377,"In Philadelphia, one teacher went on a rant about the fact that “parents” can now listen in on his social indoctrination, thanks to online learning. The leftist brainwasher has since made his twitter account ‘private,’ but his words were captured on screenshots, showing just how many teachers think of parents in America… they consider them the enemy. Here’s a hint for any parents who think that the public school system is a good thing… if they demand that their instruction is “private,” it’s not good. Red State reported: The left owns our public education system due to years of infiltration, coercion, and strong-arming. They’ve apparently become so comfortable and cocky in the position that they’re now openly complaining that you’ll now be able to hear their attempts at brainwashing your children. Apparently, you being involved in what your child learns bothers these teachers. The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh screen-capped the tweets of educator and author Matthew R. Kay who has since switched his Twitter account to “protected” after his tweets began to circulate. Kay goes on a multi-tweet rant about how parents can now sit in on virtual classes thanks to rules put in place by districts reacting to COVID-19. Kay openly hates the idea that his brainwashing on social justice and racial matters can now be overheard by the parents, which violates the “secure barriers” and “what happens here stays here” mentality provided by the physical barriers of actual classrooms. He goes on to say that while conservative parents are definitely the biggest problem, he’s also concerned about leftist parents who might not see eye to eye with his attempts at guiding his students towards his way of looking at racism and homophobia. Walsh screen-capped another response where another teacher looked at parents, not as parents, but as “outsiders.” This teacher noted that parent interference is something to “worry about a lot” since her students are tasked with discussing the news but many allegedly stay quiet because of “outsiders” listening in and using their words against them. Some of the responses are worse than the original tweet. Here’s a teacher referring to parents as “outsiders.” This is terrifying stuff. pic.twitter.com/Alz0j8bpCi — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) August 10, 2020 Today’s school teachers have become so convinced of their own righteousness that they view the parents as complications they need to get around instead of what they actually are, the parents. It is up to the parent to raise the children in the way they see fit. If there are certain values that they want to instill in the child then that is their business and theirs alone. The teacher’s job isn’t to teach the student morality or right and wrong, the teacher’s job is to instill a level of knowledge about subjects necessary for the child to function as an adult in our society, i.e. reading, writing, arithmetic, etc. If the educator of your student views you as an enemy of any kind then that educator does not need to be in charge of educating your child. Your child’s morality should be directly under the control of the parent, not people appointing themselves as such outside of the walls of your home. Those who do attempt to undermine the parents are oftentimes self-absorbed social justice advocates whose moral compass is questionable at the best of times and who often do not have our society’s best interests in mind. They often instill a sense of fear, hatred, and prejudice in your child while leaving them woefully ignorant on matters that would have been considered basic learning not 30 years ago. I wrote a much larger and detailed article on how our education system and these “teachers” have become a plague on our families and the education of our youth. You can click on the link below. While the Coronavirus has ruined much in our society, the one thing it has done is to expose the lunacy that our education system has become to many parents. Being able to sit in on what our child is learning has allowed us a view into what happens behind the walls at schools and it’s increasingly not pretty. Many educators use this access to your child as a way to create ideological clones like themselves that will go on to vote just like them or worse, go on to become activists who don black masks that destroy windows and do violence on innocents in the name of justice. Fox News covered the story too, reporting: “So, this fall, virtual class discussion will have many potential spectators — parents, siblings, etc. — in the same room. We’ll never be quite sure who is overhearing the discourse. What does this do for our equity/inclusion work?” Kay tweeted. “How much have students depended on the (somewhat) secure barriers of our physical classrooms to encourage vulnerability? How many of us have installed some version of ‘what happens here stays here’ to help this?” While Kay acknowledged that “damage can come from the left too,” he noted that “conservative parents” are his chief concern when teachers are engaging “in the messy work of destabilizing a kid’s racism or homophobia or transphobia.” “While conversations about race are in my wheelhouse, and remain a concern in this no-walls environment — I am most intrigued by the damage that ‘helicopter/snowplow’ parents can do in the host conversations about gender/sexuality,” he tweeted. “And while ‘conservative’ parents are my chief concern — I know that the damage can come from the left too. If we are engaged in the messy work of destabilizing a kid’s racism or homophobia or transphobia — how much do we want their classmates’ parents piling on?” [News flash—It is NOT Key’s job to train students about “gender” and “sexuality!”] Since the thread, Kay’s account has since been switched to private. He did not immediately return FOX News’ request for comment. The comments come as schools are determining the best method of instruction for the upcoming school year. The School District of Philadelphia announced last month that its schools will start the year with all students learning remotely for the first marking period which ends November 17th. Students will then transition to the hybrid learning model, which includes a mix of in-person and digital learning, “as long as guidance from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and other indicators support that it is safe to do so.”"
Sudden Spike In Cases After Cuomo Set Up COVID ‘Testing’ Sites In Red States,11 AUG 2020,1433,"In a strange an bizarre coincidence, red states like Florida, Texas, and Georgia have seen massive ‘spikes’ in COVID cases directly after Andrew Cuomo ‘helped’ set up additional testing areas in those states. Cuomo has been largely blamed for the outrageous number of deaths in New York after a number of criminally negligent incidents were exposed, such as shipping infected people to nursing homes, leading to the deaths of thousands. https://twitter.com/TheRightMelissa/status/1293040560723435526 The Gateway Pundit reported: New York state and Governor Cuomo had THE WORST Coronavirus death ratio in the world — higher than any state (except New Jersey) and higher than ANY COUNTRY! Under Cuomo’s leadership thousands of New Yorkers were needlessly killed in nursing homes, adult care facilities and homes for people with disabilities. After destroying his state now Governor Cuomo is setting up testing sites in several other states for some reason. Andrew Cuomo helped establish COVID testing sites in St. Petersburg, Florida. Cuomo also helped Houston set up two additional testing sites. And Cuomo brought a COVID-19 testing team to Georgia. Cuomo is spreading his medicine like Cuba shares doctors. Who’s paying for all of this? After having the worst COVID-19 record in the world Cuomo has no shame in lecturing other states on this deadly virus. Interestingly, as soon as the Cuomo sites were up, cases seemed to increase."
LA Councilman Voted To Cut Police Budget Had Cops At His House 8 Times Since April,11 AUG 2020,3891,"One councilman for Los Angeles voted to slash the city’s police budget by $150 million, but apparently thinks they should still be at his beck and call. He called them to his house to “patrol” against protestors eight times since April. Breitbart News reported: Fox 11 reporter Bill Melugin tweeted a link Friday to a public information records request that reportedly showed Councilman Mike Bonin “called LAPD to his home 8 times since 4/4/20, including to provide extra patrols and protection from peaceful protesters at his house”: A public records request reveals that LA city councilman Mike Bonin, who voted to defund LAPD by $150 million, has called LAPD to his home 8 times since 4/4/20, including to provide extra patrols and protection from peaceful protesters at his house. https://t.co/Z6yhJ8XKM4 — Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) August 8, 2020 In a subsequent tweet, Melugin said it was not him who filed the request, but someone else: ***I do not deserve any credit for this*** someone else filed this records request and once it is fulfilled, LAPD posts it publicly and it becomes publicly available info. The request does not say who filed it, but props to whoever did it! — Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) August 8, 2020 Bonin, whose website described him as a “Progressive Problem-Solver,” later denied the accusations and said he had never asked officers to patrol his home: No, Bill, this is as false as the tampon story you broke. I have NEVER asked LAPD for patrols at my house. https://t.co/32ZZbSVTQL — Mike Bonin (@mikebonin) August 8, 2020 Following Bonin’s denial, Melugin tweeted that “Multiple LAPD sources say they would not generate their own calls for a simple patrol”: Councilman Bonin denies calling ever LAPD to his home in this thread. https://t.co/BwJKH35ZOd
Multiple LAPD sources say they would not generate their own calls for a simple patrol. High level LAPD source texted me the following in response to Bonin’s claims. https://t.co/Q8I9mwezyl pic.twitter.com/HxozplLoc0 — Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) August 8, 2020 In a Twitter thread, Bonin claimed when protesters showed up to his house, “I specifically asked LAPD NOT to send anyone.” Seven of the eight calls you cite were apparently generated by LAPD themselves, sending patrols without my request and often without my knowledge. — Mike Bonin (@mikebonin) August 8, 2020 The only time LAPD has come at my request was to pick up as evidence the syringes that one of the right-wing protesters left on our doorsteps. — Mike Bonin (@mikebonin) August 8, 2020 [Bigot. How did he know they were ‘right wing’ protestors?] “This is a cute tactic to try to silence or intimidate a public official who is standing up to the police union. It ain’t working,” Bonin concluded. The Los Angeles City Council voted in June to study ways to cut the LAPD’s budget by $100 million to $150 million, according to ABC 7. The report continued: The council voted 11-3 with Councilmen Paul Koretz, Joe Buscaino and John Lee dissenting. Although community activists presented their idea for more dramatic reductions in law enforcement spending, the city’s Budget and Finance Committee sent the proposal to the full council. … The People’s Budget LA proposal was developed by a coalition of organizations led by Black Lives Matter’s Los Angeles chapter, and it seeks to have the LAPD’s proposed budget cut by 90%, with the funds allocated to social services, such as mental health and housing. LAPD’s proposed operating budget for the next fiscal year is about $1.86 billion. “I think we owe it to Los Angeles to come up with a better and a smarter way of doing public safety and emergency response, and I think this motion is the first step in doing that,” Bonin said at the time. “It’s not about random slashing and cuts. It’s about re-prioritizing and … to invest in neighborhood safety, and there’s ways to do that,” he concluded."
Nashville Councilwoman Demands Law Charging Non-Mask Wearers With “Murder”,10 AUG 2020,3484,"Despite empirical medical studies that have been conducted over the last 15 years (before the COVID scheme) showing that masks are completely and wholly ineffective for preventing the transmission of viral respiratory illnesses, a councilwoman in Nashville is demanding that people who don’t wear them be charged with “murder.” Of course, there’s also the fact that 99.8 percent of people have NO problem recovering from COVID-19 AND there’s a cure in hydroxychloroquine… but those pesky truths won’t get in the way of the inflammatory (and it appears desperate bid for attention) fear mongering carried out by Sharon Hurt. The Blaze reported: Sharon Hurt, an at-large member of the Nashville Metro Council, suggested this week that people who do not wear a face mask, but spread coronavirus, should be hit with attempted murder or murder charges. During an August 5 meeting between the city’s Public Safety, Beer & Regulated Beverages and Health, Hospitals, & Social Services committees, Hurt asked whether the council could enact legislation criminally charging people who don’t wear face coverings in a similar fashion HIV-positive people who knowingly spread HIV without informing partners. She said: “My question goes back to legislation. I don’t know if Mike Jameson could be the one to answer the question, but my concern is — you know I work for an organization, that if they pass a virus, then they are tried for murder or attempted murder, if they are not told … and this person who may very well pass this virus that’s out in the air because they’re not wearing a mask is basically doing the same thing to someone who contracts it and dies from it. “It seems to me that we have been more reactive, as opposed to proactive, and a little too late, too little. So, my thing is, maybe there should be legislation, stronger legislation, I don’t know if Mike Jameson is… can speak to it, but maybe there needs to be stronger legislation to say that if you do not wear a mask and you subject exposure of this virus to someone else then there will be some stronger penalty as it is in other viruses that are exposed.” [Some quick difference here: HIV IS deadly… and there is no cure, while COVID CAN be cured and has been. HIV transmission requires intimate contact and a level of trust not required in basic societal interaction. The number of cases of COVID, compared to H1N1, is infinitesimal, and there is no need for these outrageous restrictions, many experts argue. And, there are the medical studies showing that masks don;t even impact the transmission of this type of respiratory virus.] Mike Jameson, director of legislative affairs and senior adviser to Nashville Mayor John Cooper (D), responded by informing Hurt that the city council does not have the legal authority to create criminal statutes. “[T]he council does not have the opportunity on its own to create criminal legislation, that is a state creature. We’re warranted by state law, to apply criminal application to violations, just for example, as the state law allows us to apply a Class E misdemeanor to violate a health director violation,” Jameson explained. “But, in terms of creating a new code, or class of criminal offenses, that is a creature of state law.” In response, Hurt said she “was afraid that was going to be the answer.” Nashville city councilwoman Sharon Hurt calls for legislation to charge people with murder for not wearing a mask… https://t.co/4FVzt83QHQ — Roz  (@Roz )1596913470.0  "
Montana Uses COVID ‘Relief’ To Boost Census Efforts,10 AUG 2020,1457,"In Montana, officials have slated $530,000 of coronavirus relief funds to assisting the efforts of the census. The Telegraph reported: Montana is spending $530,000 in coronavirus relief money to boost Census outreach efforts with two months left in the once-a-decade population count. The U.S. Census Bureau is ending its counting efforts on Sept. 30, a month earlier than the extension that was announced this spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the bureau said Tuesday. The state is partnering with the Montana Nonprofit Association, Western Native Voice and Forward Montana to help contact people who have not already responded to the census, officials said. The state’s 56% self-response rate is behind the national average. An accurate count could help Montana gain a second U.S. House seat and affects the amount of federal funding the state receives. … There’s an outbreak of six cases of COVID-19 in connection with a long-term care facility in the Cascade County, the county’s health department reported Tuesday. The agency cited medical privacy laws in not naming the facility. In Carbon County, health officials are ordering face masks be worn in public even if the number of people considered infected in the county falls below four — the threshold at which the governor’s mask mandate kicks in. County officials say it’s unrealistic for businesses to follow active case rates daily to determine whether their customers should be wearing masks."
Trump Smackdown! Roberts’ Decision Opens The Door For President To Shame Dems,10 AUG 2020,9534,"On Saturday, President Trump proved yet again that career democrats bent on achieving China’s goals for the U.S. are no match for his shrewd intelligence. After the Supreme Court, thanks to non-conservative Justice Roberts, prevented the president from reversing Obama’s amnesty action on DACA, basically saying that no president can undo the actions of a previous one, President Trump used that decision to issue executive orders to help the American people. Pelosi and ilk were demanding trillions in bailout funds for liberal states that have been on the verge of bankruptcy for years, using COVID as an excuse. Her leverage was the American people she claims to ‘care’ about. Basically, she was holding workers hostage in order to pass her massive spending bill that featured outrageous democrat demands. Trump destroyed that scheme on Saturday. The Daily Caller reported: President Donald Trump signed four orders aimed at providing coronavirus relief through executive action on Saturday as Congress is currently gridlocked on the issue. Trump’s first order seeks to establish a payroll tax cut holiday from August 1, 2020 through the end of the year. The second directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies to prohibit evictions. The third order establishes a $400-per-week addition to the paycheck protection program for workers. The fourth will provide relief for Americans’ student loans. “It will be rapidly distributed,” Trump said. Pres says he’s ordering a payroll tax holiday for those making less than $100K/year. Would be in effect from August 1 to the end of 2020. Says if he’s re-elected he’ll extend the holiday and terminate the tax. — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) August 8, 2020 Trump made the announcement one day after announcing other executive orders mandating that health insurers provide coverage for preexisting conditions. Coverage for preexisting conditions is a major part of the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump administration is currently asking the Supreme Court to invalidate. Trump has long vowed that, though he seeks to remove Obamacare, he would ensure the replacement also provided coverage for preexisting conditions. “Over the next two weeks I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers,” Trump said Friday evening. “This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of.” Trump’s announced six other campaign promises on Thursday in Ohio. He said he would keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and bring more back from overseas. He was also heavily critical of China, saying he would make consequences for companies that do business there. Trump has been heavily critical of China since entering office in 2017, but has ramped up his rhetoric after the coronavirus spread from China across the globe. He has taken to calling COVID-19 the “China virus” and has suggested the U.S. is investigating ways to hold China accountable for its role in allowing the virus to become a global pandemic. Fox News opined: What a smackdown! Furious that Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were blocking a bill to help Americans through the COVID-19 crisis, President Trump stepped up and got the job done, all by himself. Over the weekend, he issued four executive orders that would extend modified unemployment relief to millions who are out of work, protect many from eviction from their homes, provide continued relief from student loan debt and suspend payroll taxes for employers and those earning less than $100,000. It may not be enough, but it was more than Democrats were offering. This made House Speaker Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., very, very unhappy. Pelosi called Trump’s measures “illusions”; sorry, Madam Speaker, for families in need, an extra $400 per week unemployment pay is absolutely real, and extremely welcome. The president boxed the Democrats in – how can they possibly challenge his orders or take his mandated benefits away from people? The chagrined duo whined that Trump “still does not comprehend the seriousness or the urgency of the health and economic crises facing working families.” On the contrary, the president understands the urgency very well, and also understands political hardball. Instead of compromising on legislation that would immediately help Americans pummeled by the coronavirus, Pelosi and Schumer prioritized issues that had nothing to do with the well-being of the nation. They pressed instead to ban ID requirements and signature verification for voters – measures that, as the president noted, would encourage increased fraud in our elections, and that Republicans would never accept. Mainly, Pelosi and Schumer stonewalled because they want to torpedo the U.S. economy. Democrats know that creating jobs is Trump’s signature achievement, and also the most important issue to voters. By blocking the next round of stimulus, they intentionally undermined the financial security of tens of millions of Americans. They don’t care; their priority is beating President Trump. The American people be damned. But aren’t Democrat leaders confident they will oust Trump in November? Hasn’t that been their message of late? That we will see not just a blue wave, but a blue tsunami, taking over the Senate as well as the Oval Office? That faux optimism is entirely manufactured, aimed at driving down turnout and fundraising from disheartened Republicans.  Democrats know their candidate’s brief surge is already fading. Polling shows Joe Biden’s lead slipping both nationally and in crucial swing states. Polling shows Joe Biden’s lead slipping both nationally and in crucial swing states. In late July, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls gave him a nine-point lead; that gap is now six points. Two of the newest polls show Biden ahead by only three points. Biden is also losing ground in swing states like Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan. Democrats read these polls. They know this race will be close, which is why they must keep the economy battened down. The last thing they want is another stimulus measure that would pump more money into voters’ pockets. Democrats are terrified that in spite of the dreadful disease, the continued lockdowns from blue-state governors and blue-city mayors, the teachers unions’ refusal to go back to work – and despite the riots that have convulsed many of our cities – the economy is coming back to life. Economists and investors are dumbfounded at the resilience of the American consumer. Nearly every economic report in recent weeks has beaten forecasts, including the most recent jobs number. There were 1.8 million jobs created in July; the experts were looking for 1.6 million. The over-achievement reflects the unprecedented nature of the recession. This country has never voluntarily closed up shop, but that’s what our politicians did to fight the virus. We may never know if that was the correct response; Sweden’s experience suggests that such draconian measures might not have been necessary. Who knows? What we do know is that Democrats were giddy to see Trump’s accomplishments – unemployment at a 50-year low, rising incomes and growth, a surge in manufacturing — buried in the coronavirus rubble. They are terrified he might do it again, just in time for the election. They are right to be worried. Surveys show that inventories are at six-year lows, which is propelling manufacturing higher. The ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for July posted the best reading since March 2019 by climbing to 54.2 from 52.6 in June and topping the consensus estimate of 53.6. New orders accelerated, too. Housing is booming and auto sales are strong. Corporate earnings, though clobbered by the shutdowns, have come in better than expected and estimates for the balance of the year have moved substantially higher. COVID cases appear to have peaked, suggesting the dampening impact from a resurgence in some states may dissipate. Also, the U.S. is not the only country seeing a reacceleration in activity. China and Europe are also trending higher. According to ISI Evercore’s Ed Hyman, “In just three months, the Global Composite PMI plunged 26 points. And in just three months it has rebounded 25 points, to 50.8. Virtually no one expected this much of a rebound, which helps explain why the stock market has surged.” Note that any reading over 50 signals expansion. The last time we had a synchronized global pickup, U.S. growth soared. That could happen again. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are horrified by the destruction in Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis and other cities mismanaged by liberal Democrats. The push to defund the police and to let criminals out of jail has let loose a plague of violent crime in cities like New York that had managed for years to keep the streets safe. None of this helps Biden. Democrats understand that the chaos will drive away voters. Ted Wheeler, the liberal mayor of Portland, recently warned rioters that they were no longer protesting, but instead were trying to “commit murder”; he also warned them of serving as “a prop for the reelection campaign of Donald Trump.” Imagine – Wheeler was not so concerned that the rioters were literally trying to burn people alive in a police station; he was unhappy that the videos might help Republicans. That’s where Democrats are today; they deserve to lose."
Dem Pelosi Flips Out Over Being Asked A Legitimate Question,7 AUG 2020,6628,"Democrats in America apparently expect members of the press to carefully cover up all their evil deeds and promote their false narratives, so when Judy Woodruff actually asked Nancy Pelosi a ‘gently phrased’ legitimate question, Pelosi flipped out and accused Woodruff of being a republican “advocate.” Seriously. One question. Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Pelosi flips out at Judy Woodruff here because Woodruff isn't trying to bury the evidence that Democrats are purposely obstructing the stimulus bill because they'd rather see Republicans take a loss than see people receive relief: pic.twitter.com/vUmAedWKCO — Eddie Zipperer (@EddieZipperer) August 6, 2020 The American Thinker commented on the incident: Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, appeared on PBS to be interviewed by Judy Woodruff. No Democrat who shows up there expects to be challenged, but Woodruff did so ever so gently, asking her why the Democrats had not found common ground with Republicans to pass a second stimulus package. Nancy Pelosi, however, is a ghoul, a venomous person who is well and truly rotten to her core.  She accused the gently probing Woodruff right off the bat of being “an advocate” for Republicans. It was a perfect example showing that just about everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie or at least a monstrous bending of the truth. But this much is clear from that interview, which a cowed Woodruff gave her plenty of time to expand upon:  That the left seeks to continue the ruination of the U.S. economy by any means necessary. COVID is their latest useful hook, and most egregious tool they are using to that end.  Do they care about the millions of school kids cloistered at home without their teachers or friends?  Not one bit.  Do they care about the millions of small businesses this phony lockdown has destroyed?  No way.  They want to ruin the middle class, to make them dependent on the kindness of a beneficent government. Is there such a thing as a beneficent government?  The Founders of this great nation did not set out to take care of people as she sees it.  They put forth a Constitution that above all granted freedom to all Americans, the freedom to succeed or fail, the equal opportunity to achieve, to revel in the liberty the Constitution guaranteed. Nancy Pelosi and her party are full-throated enemies of this nation and the principles of self-determination that our population has long taken for granted.  Like Obama promised, they seek to transform this country into something it was never meant to be and not in a good way.  Make no mistake, the Democrat Party of today has designs of vast new powers over all of us. The leftist boosters of the lockdowns are most likely shocked by the abject capitulation of so many to the ridiculous dictates from the leaders of leftist-run states. Some fear-ravaged people are so frightened of the virus, they physically attack people they encounter without masks for endangering them and others!  What a crock!  How can this be in a free and healthy nation in which individual freedom is the rule, when the percentage of people who have died from COVID is .00049%? So what does the left do?  They double down.  Let kids go back to school?  No way.  When you have the people on the ropes to this extent, why not push the envelope?  If so many people choose to be sheep, the left’s best tactic may just be going after the sheepdogs and try to co-opt them as well.  That is the job the media has embraced with excited fervor: make those who are not sufficiently terrified of the virus outcasts in their own communities.  The underlying strategy is to continue the lockdowns, the school closures, the mask mandates in order to prolong the distress, the anxiety of a nation. The democrats mean to win the election with this misguided strategy.  They are worse than the Orwell’s Big Brother and Thought Police and their agenda is no less malevolent. Nancy Pelosi is as anti-American as those more recent additions to Congress — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, among others — Democrats who loathe this country no matter how much opportunity it has provided for them to thrive. Like Oprah, who has fallen in line with the Democratic Party line that declares America is forever tainted by white supremacy.  This from a black woman who is one of the richest persons on the planet.  Michelle Obama is on the same page, the woman who was first lady for eight years and traveled the world in luxury on the taxpayer’s dime.  She endlessly complains and never has a kind word about America. Nancy Pelosi is no different. She has become a multi-millionaire while in Congress.  She is as vile and corrupt as Hillary Clinton.  Like Biden, she is used to being coddled by the media and reacts badly when even mildly challenged. She is a very nasty piece of work who values nothing over her own power and her freedom to wield it. Her own city has been destroyed by the politics she embraces and she could not care less.  She and her likeminded colleagues in Congress and the media only care about one thing, one thing only:  Defeating and destroying President Trump.  That is their singular goal and for four years that has been their only goal, the one and only thing to which they have devoted their every waking moment.  Pelosi and her partners in crime are a blight upon this nation. The PBS interview, Judy Woodruff and Pelosi, is only slightly less ridiculous than any recent interview with Joe Biden.  Word salad is the apt description of the nonsense each of them spews.  They talk but their words are meaningless.  It is difficult to know if they think they are fooling people or if they are merely fooling themselves. Either way, if they think the majority of the American people are falling for their transparent plan to destroy Trump by devastating the country and our economy, they are foolish beyond belief.  All those vicious scaredy cat twitterites are insignificant cultists, mind-numbed converts to the Marxist BLM and Antifa anti-Americanism. The left’s grasping, censorious control of social media is a sad commentary on the willingness of mostly young people to not think for themselves but to endlessly regurgitate the anti-American garbage with which they’ve been indoctrinated at school.  Twitter did not exist when Nancy Pelosi began perpetrating her greed and ill will upon unsuspecting Americans but she has somehow prevailed. The truth about the damage she and her disciples will one day be told by legitimate historians and it will be a tale of treachery. Well said."
VA Lawmakers Promise ‘No One Tracking You’: Urge Citizens To Download ‘Tracing’ App,7 AUG 2020,1844,"Many people argue that democrat must have an extremely low opinion of the intelligence of the average American citizen… otherwise, they wouldn’t lie so blatantly or ridiculously. In Virginia, democrat lawmakers are urging people to download a COVID ‘tracing’ app, but claim it isn’t “tracking” them. The Washington Examiner reported: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam encouraged state residents on Wednesday to download the app COVIDWISE, a joint project from Apple and Google that uses Bluetooth technology to collect location data anonymously that can be later used to alert others of a potential outbreak. The Democrat said Virginians should not worry that they are being tracked without their consent. “This is a way we can all work together to contain this virus,” Northam said. “No one is tracking you. None of your personal information is saved.” When users download the app, Bluetooth data is used to track the movement of participating users, and the interface allows people infected by the coronavirus to alert anyone else they may have come into contact with easily and anonymously according to the data recorded by the app. “We’re using every possible approach to fight this virus and keep Virginians healthy,” Northam wrote in a statement provided to the Associated Press. “The COVIDWISE app is completely anonymous, protects personal privacy, and gives you an additional tool to protect yourself and your community.” The website to Virginia’s public health system includes a description of the app, which states it collects data from users who are within six feet of each other for at least 15 minutes. “Your device will share anonymous tokens via Bluetooth with other COVIDWISE users,” a message prompt reads on the app. “If another user you’ve been nearby tests positive for COVID-19 within a 14-day period, your app will notify you.”"
NYC Goes Full Totalitarian: COVID Checkpoints Established To Stop Travelers With Forced ‘Papers’,6 AUG 2020,5544,"Yesterday, [Glorious Leader] Bill de Blasio announced that New York City will be using volunteers to help operate checkpoints, stopping all travelers to the state and enforcing totalitarian dictates. The Epoch Times reported: Travelers from 33 states and Puerto Rico will be reminded that they must quarantine at their final destination for two weeks, the Democrat told reporters at a press conference. “Starting today, we’re going to do something new in New York City. We will have checkpoints at key entry points to the city. Travelers coming in from those states will be given information about the quarantine, they will be reminded that it’s required, not optional, they’ll be reminded that failure to quarantine is a violation of state law, and it comes with serious penalties,” de Blasio said. New Yorkers who visit one of the states must also self-quarantine. People who violate the mandate can be fined up to $10,000. One-fifth of new CCP virus cases are from travelers entering the city from other states, according to city officials. Those states were designated by Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier this year. The list was updated on Aug. 4. The states include Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in an executive order that states would be added to the list if they have a positive COVID-19 test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents, or higher than a 10 percent test positivity rate, over a seven-day rolling average. If a state dipped under that benchmark, it would be removed from the list. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, also known as the novel coronavirus. Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The governor in March threatened legal action against Rhode Island when Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, ordered police to stop cars with New York license plates to try to slow the spread of the virus. The next day, Raimondo expanded her order to include all out-of-state visitors. The new checkpoints in New York City will be placed at major bridge and tunnel crossings and overseen by the city’s sheriff, Joseph Fucito. “We need to ensure visitors and New Yorkers returning home are taking the necessary precautions to limit the spread of this disease,” Fucito told reporters. At the same time, city workers—part of a program to test for the disease—are fanning out to Penn Station, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and other locations to stop travelers and make sure they filled out a form that includes information on where they’ll be quarantining and contact details. Travelers who neglected to fill out the form will be required to fill it out on the spot. The city’s Test and Trace program is providing free meals, hotel rooms, and other services to people who are undergoing the mandatory quarantine. Workers have made more than 86,000 phone calls and sent more than 20,000 texts. “If we can’t get through to you on the phone, we’ve deployed teams that are now knocking on your door to check in with you and make sure that you’re safe,” Dr. Ted Long, executive director of Test and Trace, said at the briefing. New York City remains the hardest hit area by COVID-19 in the nation, with nearly 19,000 deaths from the new disease, according to the city’s Department of Health. But the city has seen few deaths in recent weeks, and actions taken to slow the spread of the CCP virus has kept its infection rate below 3 percent since June 10. [No mention about inflated death numbers.] “Look around the country, all of the states, all of the cities that at one point were belittling New York City or looking at us as the place that couldn’t handle the challenge, well, unfortunately for everyone, the tables have turned,” de Blasio said. “Now, New York City is the place that is showing everyone else how it is done.” Breitbart News reported: Travelers from 35 high-risk states and Puerto Rico must quarantine for 14 days when they reach New York City, and de Blasio is determined to enforce the requirement. During Wednesday’s press briefing, the mayor announced intensifying measures meant to discourage visitors from flouting the order. … Those caught outside of quarantine within 14 days of arrival could face fines up to $10,000. Even so, de Blasio maintained that the idea is to prevent, rather than punish. “The idea is we don’t want to penalize people,” de Blasio he said. “We want to educate them, we want to make sure they’re following the rules.” … Visitors to the city will also receive phone calls to check in. Those who fail to do so may be subject to a raid. “If we can’t get through to you on the phone, we’ve now deployed teams to knock on your door and check in on you to make sure you’re safe,” Long said. De Blasio sees this as a strong first step, but allowed for the possibility of introducing wider and harsher measures in the future. “Having people see that these checkpoints are starting to happen around the city is going to send a powerful message,” he said. “If we think it’s an important tool … we might keep expanding it.” [Yeah, the message of total slavery, Comrade.] Shortly after the announcement, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey revealed that, despite their role in policing the crossings, they were not informed of the plan. A spokeswoman for City Hall told the New York Post that “most” of the checkpoints wouldn’t be on Port Authority property but “at roadways coming into the City before or after bridges and tunnels.”"
"LA Mayor Announces Basic Water, Power Will Be Shut Off For “Violators” Of COVID Restrictions",6 AUG 2020,4630,"Los Angeles businesses, homes, and churches that decide to exercise their constitutional rights to life and liberty have been threatened with power and water shut off by the city. Fox News reported: During a press conference Wednesday night, Mayor Eric Garcetti authorized the city to shut off power and water to properties, including houses and businesses, that are in violation of gathering regulations as a means to “shut these places down permanently.” “By turning off that power, shutting off that water we feel we can close these places down, which usually are not one-time offenders but multiple-offenders,” Garcetti said. He noted that local law enforcement officers are having a hard time dealing with gatherings where there are hundreds of people who are “breaking the law.” “We know we can do this,” Garcetti said, responding to a question about the measure’s legality. The authorization comes as the state battles a recent surge in confirmed cases. According to the mayor’s office, Los Angeles had nearly 198,000 cases as of Wednesday, as well as 4,825 fatalities. KTLA explained: “Starting on Friday night, if LAPD responds and verifies that a large gathering is occurring at a property, and we see these properties offending time and time again, they will provide notice and initiate the process to request that DWP shut off service within the next 48 hours,” Garcetti said. The mayor said this enforcement is not focused on small gatherings in people’s homes, but on the “people determined to break the rules, posing significant public dangers and a threat to all of us.” The announcement came after the county’s health department on Tuesday issued a “legally binding” order banning gatherings following a large Beverly Crest house party that involved people crowding together, the majority without face masks. Violating the health officer order prohibiting parties and other gatherings is “a crime punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement. L.A. police officers had responded to the Beverly Crest party Monday after receiving disturbance calls. Though gatherings had already been banned in L.A. County, officers did not break up the party, explaining the music was not that loud and it was held on a private residence. Officers ended up returning to the residence hours later when a shooting at the party left one person dead and others wounded. “While we have already closed all nightclubs and bars, these large house parties have essentially become nightclubs in the Hills,” Garcetti said. “Many times, the homes are vacant, or used for short term rentals, and beyond the noise, the traffic and nuisance, these large parties are unsafe and can cost Angelenos their lives.” LAPD had previously said officers would crack down on parties in the Hollywood Hills, many of them hosted in short-term rentals. But the parties have continued across the city. Department spokesman Josh Rubenstein told KTLA that LAPD follows the city’s order, which says the ban on gatherings “does not apply to gatherings within a single household or living unit.” “By turning off that power, shutting down that water, we feel we can close these places down, which usually are not one-time offenders, but multiple offenders,” Garcetti said. City Councilman David Ryu on Wednesday also introduced a motion that seeks to crack down on house parties by threatening penalties, including utility shutoffs. Los Angeles County has recorded a total of 197,912 coronavirus cases and 4,825 deaths attributed to COVID-19 as of Wednesday — though a technical issue with the state’s lab reporting system has resulted in an undercount of the county’s cases, officials said. Of the cases the county does have confirmed, the majority are among people between the ages of 18 and 49 years old, with over 109,000 confirmed cases. The age group accounted for nearly 60% of the 2,347 new coronavirus cases reported Wednesday. Case rates among people between 18 to 29 quadrupled from the beginning of June to the end of July. “These are folks who are out in the workforce, and in many cases they may be shopping at our retail stores, enjoying the recreational venues that are open and socializing with people outside of their household,” county Health Director Barbara Ferrer said. “This is also the age group that’s most likely to be attending the large parties.” Ferrer said the responsibility ultimately lies on the host of the party, but residents need to come into compliance with health officer orders. In other words, it’s for the good of society… so obey or be ostracized and destroyed."
"Beirut Explosion Kills Over 100, Injures Thousands More After Ammonium Nitrite Ignites",5 AUG 2020,6274,"In what appears to have been an accident yesterday evening, a massive explosion ripped through Beirut, killing at least 100 people and injuring many thousands more. Entire blocks of the city were leveled to rubble, and smoke and gases were still rising from the devastation hours after the blast. The Associated Press reported: Smoke was still rising from the port, where a towering building of silos was half destroyed, spilling out mounds of grain. Hangars around it were completely toppled. Much of the downtown area was littered with damaged vehicles and debris that had rained down from the shattered facades of buildings. An official with the Lebanese Red Cross said at least 100 people were killed and more than 4,000 were wounded. George Kettaneh said the toll could rise further. It was unclear what caused the blast, which appeared to have been triggered by a fire and struck with the force of an earthquake. It was the most powerful explosion ever seen in the city, which was split in half by the 1975-1990 civil war and has endured conflicts with neighboring Israel and periodic bombings and terror attacks. Scores of people were missing, with relatives pleading on social media for help locating loved ones. An Instagram page called “Locating Victims Beirut” sprang up with photos of missing people, and radio presenters read the names of missing or wounded people throughout the night. Many residents moved in with friends or relatives after their apartments were damaged and treated their own injuries because hospitals were overwhelmed. Lebanon was already on the brink of collapse amid a severe economic crisis that has ignited mass protests in recent months. Its health system is confronting a coronavirus surge, and there were concerns the virus could spread further as people flooded into hospitals. There was no evidence the explosion was an attack. Instead, many Lebanese blamed it on decades of corruption and poor governance by the entrenched political class that has ruled the tiny Mediterranean country since the civil war. Saint George University Hospital, one of the major private hospitals in Beirut which had been receiving COVID-19 patients, was out of commission Wednesday after suffering major damage. A physician who identified himself as Dr. Emile said 16 staff and patients, including four nurses, died in the blast. He declined to give his last name out of privacy concerns. The blast also wounded a number of U.N. peacekeepers stationed in the area. Bangladesh said 21 members of its Navy were wounded, one critically. Italy, one of the top contributors to the UNIFIL mission, said one of its soldiers was wounded. Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi told a local TV station that it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship impounded in 2013. Explosives experts and video footage suggested the ammonium nitrate may have been ignited by a fire at what appeared to be a nearby warehouse containing fireworks. Ammonium nitrate is a common ingredient in fertilizer as well as explosives. It was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, when a truck bomb containing 2,180 kilograms (4,800 pounds) of fertilizer and fuel oil ripped through a federal building, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more. Security forces cordoned off the port area on Wednesday as a bulldozer entered to help clear away debris. A young man begged troops to allow him to enter and search for his father, who has been missing since the blast occurred. He was directed to a port official who wrote down his details. In Beirut’s hard-hit Achrafieh district, civil defense workers and soldiers were working on locating missing people and clearing the rubble. At least one man was still pinned under stones from an old building that had collapsed. Volunteers hooked him up to an oxygen tank to help him breathe while others tried to free his leg. The blast severely damaged numerous apartment buildings, potentially leaving large numbers of people homeless at a time when many Lebanese have lost their jobs and seen their savings evaporate because of a currency crisis. The explosion also raises concerns about how Lebanon will continue to import nearly all of its vital goods with its main port devastated. Prime Minister Hassan Diab, in a short televised speech, appealed for international aid, saying: “We are witnessing a real catastrophe.” He reiterated his pledge that those responsible for the disaster will pay the price, without commenting on the cause. There is also the issue of food security in Lebanon, a tiny country already hosting over 1 million Syrians displaced by that country’s nearly decade-long civil war. Drone footage shot Wednesday by The Associated Press showed that the blast tore open a cluster of towering grain silos, dumping their contents into the debris and earth thrown up by the blast. Some 80% of Lebanon’s wheat supply is imported, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Estimates suggest some 85% of the country’s grain was stored at the now-destroyed silos. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency quoted Raoul Nehme, the minister of economy and trade, as saying that all the wheat stored at the facility had been “contaminated” and couldn’t be used. But he insisted Lebanon had enough wheat for its immediate needs and would import more. Several countries have pledged aid in the aftermath of the blast, with even Israel offering humanitarian assistance. The two countries have been in conflict for decades, and Israel fought a 2006 war with the Hezbollah militant group. Lebanon’s economic crisis is rooted in decades of systemic corruption by political factions that exploit public institutions for the benefit of their supporters. Decades after the civil war, residents endure frequent power outages and poor public services. Lebanese have held mass protests calling for sweeping political change since last autumn but few of their demands have been met as the economic situation has steadily worsened. Beirut’s port and the customs authority are notoriously corrupt. Like nearly all public institutions, they are controlled by Lebanon’s political factions, including Hezbollah."
"150,000 Dead: Documents Shows Real Reason Fauci Won’t Green Light Hydroxychloroquine",5 AUG 2020,3191,"It seems strange to many people that a drug that has been proved effective in the treatment of COVID… like 100 percent effective as a cure…would be rejected by the federal government as an approved treatment. However, thanks to a now removed document, Americans know why. Hydroxychloroquine would stand in the way of Dr. Anthony Fauci cashing in on a ‘necessary’ vaccine. The National Pulse reported: A document no longer available from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding “Emergency Use Authorization” of potential COVID-19 treatments appears to suggest that hydroxychloroquine satisfies the criteria for the classification, but would stand in the way of lucrative other drugs, and a vaccine. The possible treatment, shunned by the mainstream media and Big Tech, has far-ranging champions from Yale epidemiologists to frontline doctors to President Trump. Despite this support, corroborated by scientific studies, the medical establishment under the auspices of Dr. Anthony Fauci have refused to grant hydroxychloroquine “Emergency Use Authorization” (EUA). July 29th documents from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) presentation reveal, however, that the “qualifying criteria” for extending EUA to the drug appear to have been met: it “may be effective” and that “no adequate, approved, and available alternative” exists. The document makes clear that Emergency Use Authorization cannot be used for more than one drug or therapeutic, and the establishment is potentially therefore saving the EUA pre-emptively for vaccines and remdesivir – patently high-value Big Pharma drugs – instead of hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who authored a study on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, outlined the medical establishment’s campaign against the drug on the War Room: Pandemic show. He emphasized that Dr. Fauci has “lied to the American people” by insisting that authorizing a treatment for COVID-19 rests on “controlled trials to get anything through the FDA.” “That is not true. That has never been the historical precedent and almost no other medication has ever had to meet those standards,” Dr. Zelenko continued. He also noted that due to the sheer existence of hydroxychloroquine – a potential treatment – “available drugs like Remdesevir and the vaccine by [the FDA’s] own internal rules cannot get EUA.” Such a classification would “facilitate the availability and use” of the drug and represents a fast-track alternative to authorizing potential life-saving treatments during public health emergencies such as the ongoing pandemic. THE DOCUMENT IN FULL: Fink FDA EUA Licensing slides 2020 Or, as Dr. Zelenko describes, “there’ 150,000 dead corpses, most of which could have been avoided if Dr. Fauci did the moral and correct thing.” The eight-page presentation entitled “Considerations for FDA Licensure vs. Emergency Use Authorization of COVID-19 Vaccines” posits two additional prerequisites for EUA: “declaration by HHS Secretary of emergency situation leading to serious or life-threatening disease or condition,” which occurred in January, and that the “known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.”"
1930’s Germany Revived In Portland: Holocaust Happened Because Citizens Ignored The Signs,3 AUG 2020,4672,"This weekend, leftists who are running riot in Portland, Oregon, thanks to liberal democrat leadership, burned piles of Bibles in ‘protest.’ Protesting over what… Decency, morality, brotherhood, peace … love? Yes. See, these anarchists are filled with hate. They hate America, they hate Christians, and they especially hate anything that highlights their depraved, soulless evil. The same sort of evil has been present in the world since its foundation, but in recent centuries, the enemy knows his time is short… so we see the tactics that worked in Germany during the 1930’s revived in Portland. Intimidation and attacks. And now, burning Bibles. Breitbart News reported: According to the Portland Police, which did not engage with demonstrators, the crowd lit several fires, including a large bonfire in the middle of the street in front of the federal courthouse. One video shows protesters feeding a small fire with Bibles, which were engulfed in flames: I don’t know what burning the Bible has to do with protesting against police brutality.

No other injuries have been reported to police, however bullets struck at least 8 occupied apartments and 7 vehicles (unknown if occupied).

Because there is NO OTHER NATION ON EARTH WHERE citizens still enjoy the dwindling freedoms Americans possess and apparently take for granted. America is almost the last country on earth where parents have the legal authority over their children, to make decisions that they think best. America offers the ability for anyone to succeed with hard work and ingenuity… and here, we can supposedly worship as we see fit… unless of course you are a Christian living in a democrat controlled state or city…. This is our last chance. The vehemence and rabid actions of the left (mail voting fraud, COVID fear mongering, and all the rest) show that they are desperate! Americans and Christians must vote as never before… otherwise, the complete surrender all of personal liberty in the name of ‘public health’ will become a permanent part of life and we will be slaves."
Sources Say Biden’s Mental Decline Rapidly “Worsening”: Questions Swirl Concerning Nominee,3 AUG 2020,1715,"Joe Biden’s cognitive decline started out as a joke (based on plenty of evidence), but it has steadily made itself more and more noticeable, and now, according to sources close to the situation, is rapidly “worsening.” Breitbart News reported: Conservative pundit and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino declared Sunday morning that former Vice President Joe Biden is suffering a rapid “cognitive decline” — and he suggested that his sources were “close to the situation.” Biden’s mental acuity has been a frequent theme of discussion, primarily among conservatives — though Democrats have also acknowledged potential problems, on occasion. In a Facebook post on Sunday morning, Bongino wrote: Not a joke and not hyperbole – I’m hearing from people close to the situation that Biden’s cognitive decline is rapidly worsening and is becoming increasingly difficult to mask. The Democrats are going to have to make a decision soon. At the Democratic Party presidential debate in Houston, Texas, last September, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro brought up the issue of Biden’s mental decline on the debate stage: “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” he said, after Biden claimed he had not said that people would have to “buy in” to his health care plan (Castro was correct). Though Castro later told Breitbart News that he had not meant his remark in precisely that way, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) seemed to echo his criticisms of Biden in post-debate interviews, saying he did not know whether the former vice president had the stamina to run a fully competitive presidential campaign. President Trump has referred to Biden throughout the campaign as “Sleepy Joe Biden.”"
"Herd Immunity Worked? No-Lockdown Sweden Sees Deaths, Cases of COVID Nearly Zero",3 AUG 2020,11238,"As more and more liberals demand that American continue to shut down and lockdown, the results of Sweden’s ‘herd immunity’ strategy seems to have worked in amazing ways. In fact, after 6 months without lockdowns, school closures or ridiculous mask mandates, Sweden’s fatality and infection rate have dropped to nearly nothing. Just the News reported: Some Swedish officials are far from declaring victory, warning there could be a second wave and that too many elderly died in the country during its comparatively lax pandemic restrictions. The country’s population-adjusted death rate, meanwhile, is in the top 10 worldwide, but lower than the rates for Italy, Spain and even New York, where heavy lockdowns prevailed. And the dramatic drop in new cases and deaths in that country point to a rapidly improving situation there in defiance of many earlier predictions. The Swedish government has engaged in minimal interventions and imposed relatively few restrictions upon its citizenry for the duration of the pandemic. Yet the so-called “Swedish model” has for months drawn alarm and derision from countless world health authorities. Many have insisted that sweeping, open-ended restrictions on social and economic activity — including lockdowns, strict “social distancing” measures, and mandatory face mask orders — are the only practical methods by which the coronavirus can be halted. Though there is relatively little evidence to support such measures, many governments — particularly those in Western Europe and the United States — have for several months imposed such orders on their respective citizens, with numerous European heads of state and U.S. governors indicating that these measures may remain in place until an effective vaccine is developed, a process that could take years, if ever, to come to fruition. Heavy mitigation has no ‘historical scientific basis’ Sweden largely eschewed such policies. Throughout March, as much of the Western world was shutting down large swaths of its economies and strictly limiting individual mobility with stay-at-home orders, Sweden opted for a much lighter touch, refusing to close down service industries, leaving schools largely open, and allowing its borders to remain open. It did restrict large gatherings for a time, while some schools were closed. According to the World Health Organization, Sweden’s daily deaths peaked in late April at 185 and have been declining ever since; on some recent days, the country has recorded as few as nine deaths. Daily new cases were in the low-to-mid-hundreds for most of July, and a few days no new cases were recorded at all. Anders Tegnell, the country’s chief epidemiologist and for months now the public face of the Swedish model, has been openly dismissive of the far-reaching mitigation measures undertaken by so many other countries. “Closedown, lockdown, closing borders — nothing has a historical scientific basis, in my view,” Tegnell said in April. “We have looked at a number of European Union countries to see whether they have published any analysis of the effects of these measures before they were started, and we saw almost none.” “Closing borders, in my opinion, is ridiculous, because COVID-19 is in every European country now,” Tegnell said at the time, adding: “Nowhere in Europe has been able to slow down the spread considerably.” Swedish death rate is among highest in the world, but lower than some lockdown countries The country has been the subject of withering criticism since March. In July, the New York Times said that the country was a “cautionary tale” for the world. The National Post in June said the Swedish model “failed” and that the country “took the pain, but realized no gain.” In May, Wired stated that the country’s epidemiological experiment “well and truly failed.” In justifying those claims, numerous commentators correctly pointed out that Sweden’s population-adjusted death rate is significantly elevated compared to its Scandinavian neighbors Finland and Denmark, both of which have death rates 10 to 12 times lower than Sweden’s. Indeed, Sweden’s adjusted death rate is No. 8 in the world, 20% higher than the United States. Tegnell has blamed those high numbers partly on the number of elderly deaths in the country, claiming Sweden did not do enough early on to protect nursing homes and retirement communities from infections. Perhaps more pointedly, in countries that imposed some of the more draconian lockdowns in the Western world — the U.K., Italy, Spain — the pandemic at times seemed to rage out of control compared with Sweden’s relatively level epidemic curve. Italy and Spain at the height of their outbreaks recorded many hundreds of deaths per day and saw, at times, local health systems on the verge of collapse. Both countries have population-adjusted fatality rates above that of Sweden; smaller government authorities, such as those of New York and New Jersey, also have fatality rates far above Sweden’s. New York State, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo instituted one of the strongest and most restrictive lockdowns in the U.S., has a population-adjusted death rate three times that of Sweden. Herd immunity may be closer for Sweden than other countries Tegnell and others have argued that lockdown countries likely have significantly lower immunity levels than Sweden’s, and that those countries may have to lock down again in the fall if and when the disease returns. Many experts have claimed that COVID-19, like some other respiratory diseases, will only be subject to the effects of herd immunity when anywhere from 60-80% of the population recovers from it; reaching those levels, it is argued, would require unacceptable levels of deaths. Yet there are indications that the herd immunity threshold for the coronavirus may be much lower than that, possibly due to the presence of protective “T cells” gained from earlier exposure to other types of coronaviruses. That theory, if true, could explain why Sweden’s death rate declined even as cases increased there. Much of the world effort to determine the disease’s herd immunity threshold has hinged upon testing individuals for COVID-19 antibodies, which signify a patient once had the disease and has since recovered from it. A study released in mid-May found that just 7.3% of Stockholm residents had coronavirus antibodies, far below even the lower bounds of most estimates of the herd immunity threshold. But peak infections in Sweden occurred roughly a month after that study even as deaths there continued to plummet — an unlikely scenario if 92.7% or more of the country had absolutely no immunity to the disease. Sweden’s steadily declining deaths and cases, then, may represent an advantage obtained by few other countries at this point. Indeed, other countries that appeared to have earlier success in clamping down on the pandemic — such as Australia, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Morocco, and others — have all lately posted rising numbers of cases, suggesting those populations may at this time be more susceptible to the virus than is Sweden’s. Other countries in Europe, meanwhile — including Germany, France, Spain, and Belgium —have all seen recent spikes in cases after several months of declining and plateaued infection rates, suggesting that those populations may have not achieved the same degree of herd immunity that Sweden appears to have developed. It is possible, on the other hand, that Sweden itself may end up experiencing a similar resurgence in cases down the road: Its peak infection rate came several months after many European countries, including those currently experiencing an unexpected spike, meaning a second wave there could also be on a similar delay. Yet Swedish authorities have argued that a resurgence in COVID-19 in that country is not just possible but likely — and that their strategy of striving for a more immune population puts them in a better position to handle it relative to other countries. That advantage, if it exists, could prove crucial moving into autumn, with many experts warning that the disease could significantly spike again once cold weather returns to the Northern Hemisphere. Swedish Health Minister Lena Hallengren last month warned the country that “the danger is not over” and that health authorities need to be prepared to manage outbreaks of the disease moving into the fall. Tegnell has suggested as much, though he has expressed optimism over Sweden’s prospects moving into the fall. “In the autumn there will be a second wave,” he told Financial Times earlier this year. “Sweden will have a high level of immunity and the number of cases will probably be quite low.” Little historical basis for lockdowns; recent studies show mixed results A notable body of medical literature has found large-scale quarantine efforts are ineffective at stopping the spread of respiratory diseases. A 2006 paper in Biosecurity and Bioterrorism, for instance, found “no historical observations or scientific studies that support the confinement by quarantine of groups of possibly infected people for extended periods in order to slow the spread of influenza,” a disease which, like COVID-19, is spread through respiratory droplets. That same year, meanwhile, a World Health Organization writing group surveyed the evidence in favor of quarantining individuals during pandemic influenza and found support for those policies lacking: A review of instances of “mandatory case reporting and isolating patients during the influenza pandemic of 1918” found that such measures “did not stop virus transmission and were impractical,” the group said. Some preliminary studies conducted since the advent of COVID-19, such as one by researchers at the University of California, San Diego and another by medical officials at Manhattan’s Icahn School of Medicine, have argued that stay-at-home orders have been effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19. Those studies, however, have yet to be certified by peer review and acknowledge various caveats about their conclusions, including data limitations and state policies that may have confounded analysis. The usage of face masks to inhibit the spread of respiratory diseases is also disputed, with only patchy evidence that widespread face coverings have much impact on transmission rates; a team of researchers in April of this year conceded that the evidence in favor of mask usage is “sparse and contested,” but that they should be used widely anyway as a precautionary measure. Throughout the pandemic, Swedish authorities have insisted that their country’s approach was one rooted in years of epidemiological research and that much of the rest of the world abandoned that data in favor of panic and hysteria. “It was as if the whole world had gone mad,” Tegnell said several weeks ago, citing the worldwide rush to lock down and quarantine. “The cases became too many, and the political pressure got too strong. And then Sweden stood there rather alone.” The epidemiologist has several times argued that the true results of various countries’ approaches to the coronavirus pandemic will only become clear after several years’ worth of study. “There is no way of knowing how this ends,” Tegnell said in June."
Florida Couple Jailed For ‘Breaking’ Mandatory House Quarantine,31 JUL 2020,2298,"Apparently, COVID has become the method that can be used to remove every right of an individual in this country. Many people wonder how long it will be before, God forbid, people who refuse to take a government forced vaccine will be ordered to stay home in “quarantine.” For now, one Florida couple has been jailed for their refusal to stay at home. The New York Post reported: A Florida couple was jailed for allegedly breaking a mandatory quarantine order after they tested positive for the coronavirus, local officials said Thursday. Jose Antonio Freire Interian, 24, and Yohana Anahi Gonzalez, 27, were arrested Wednesday evening at their Key West apartment and taken to the Stock Island Detention Center, authorities said. The Florida Department of Health in Monroe County had issued an isolation order on July 21 to the pair, instructing them to stay at home for 14 days and wear masks around others, The Miami Herald reported. But neighbors complained that the carefree couple had been breaking the rules. Freire was spotted walking his dog, making trips to the grocery store and washing his car, according to a police report. Both had been seen leaving and returning home without face coverings. The property manager at their apartment complex reported them to Key West police, and handed over surveillance footage of the pair from a camera located in a common room, the Herald reported. “An officer took the video to the judge and the judge signed the warrant,” Key West City Manager Greg Veliz told the newspaper. The couple was charged with violating the state law that requires isolation or quarantine in a public health emergency and violating emergency management. Both are second-degree misdemeanors, punishable by up to 60 days in jail. Freire and Gonzalez were released from jail Thursday morning after posting $1,000 bond each. During their stint behind bars, the couple was kept isolated from the other inmates in “negative pressure” rooms where the air is not recirculated into other areas of the jail, Monroe County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Adam Linhardt said. “The whole idea is to keep them apart from the general population,” Linhardt said. “We’ve had people in those rooms before we’ve suspected of having it. If they show symptoms, that’s where people are quarantined.”"
Wisconsin Gov. Orders All Citizens To Wear Masks Indoors,31 JUL 2020,6001,"In Wisconsin, the governor has ordered all citizens to wear masks indoors at all times, for the next 8 weeks. Forget what medical studies actually say about the effectiveness of ‘masks’ against respiratory infection, all citizens must be trained to follow the orders of their government masters. That way when the forced procedures come, dissidents (people who demand their rights under the law of God and the Constitution) will be the minority. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: Gov. Tony Evers is requiring all Wisconsin residents to wear face masks while indoors until the end of September. The order issued Thursday takes effect Saturday and makes Wisconsin the 32nd state to require face coverings — a tool health experts say can substantially reduce transmission of the coronavirus, which can cause serious illness and death and has no vaccine. [That is inaccurate. A number of studies over the past decade have disproven masks effectiveness for controlling the spread of a respiratory illness such as COVID, and many experts have argued that the cure already exists in the form of hydroxychloroquine.] Evers took the step the same day Wisconsin saw more than 1,000 new cases of the virus — continuing an upward trend of infections in recent weeks. Along with the new face mask requirement, Evers declared a new public health emergency in Wisconsin over rising cases of the virus — a move considered legally dubious by conservatives. The orders could push Republican lawmakers, who successfully sued the governor in May over his stay-at-home order, to return to the state Capitol to block Evers — another showdown with the Democratic governor the senate’s majority leader said he is considering. But Democratic lawmakers and Wisconsin bankers praised the order, saying it will help reverse a worsening outbreak in the state and provide uniform rules for businesses operating in different counties. Evers said he decided to issue the orders as a way to get on top of a virus outbreak growing out of control in recent weeks. … The governor is issuing the statewide mandate after first maintaining he lacked the authority do so and then changing course, saying for weeks he was considering the idea but worried Republican lawmakers would take him to the Wisconsin Supreme Court again. Under Evers’ order, face masks will be required for anyone age 5 or older while indoors except at a private residence. The order also applies to schools for the first few weeks of the school year if students return to classrooms. Violating the order could result in fines of up to $200. “We’ve said all along that we’re going to let science and public health experts be our guide in responding to this pandemic, and we know that masks and face coverings will save lives,” Evers said in statement. [Yeah, right.] “While I know emotions are high when it comes to wearing face coverings in public, my job as governor is to put people first and to do what’s best for the people of our state, so that’s what I am going to do.” A number of exceptions were in the order, including for members of the Legislature and the state judiciary. Exceptions to the mandate Exceptions also are made for eating and drinking, for speakers at religious services and reporters delivering news reports, and for people who have breathing issues, among other reasons. The governor’s face mask requirement takes effect the same day as the state Supreme Court’s liberal minority expands with the addition of Jill Karofsky, who was elected in April, and comes after former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle and Democratic lawmakers said Evers should issue the mandate as soon as possible. In a briefing with reporters, Evers downplayed the timing. “It doesn’t have everything to do with it — the virus is the issue, not Jill Karofsky,” he said. … Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said there are constitutional questions about Evers’ new public health emergency and mask order but signaled he would not be suing the governor over them. “I understand the necessity of doing all that we can to control the spread of COVID-19. We all know it’s serious,” Vos said in a statement. “Local governments have been responding appropriately and increasing precautionary measures as needed. But Wisconsin shouldn’t have a one-size-fits-all mandate.” Vos said a statewide mandate “doesn’t build public support when there are questions surrounding the metrics and the constitutionality of this mandate.” He said legal challenges from “citizen groups” are likely coming. Senate Republicans were more forceful, with Sen. Chris Kapenga of Delafield saying the caucus would be looking at options with their attorneys. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald of Juneau, who is running for Congress in the 5th District, said he is considering convening a floor session to block the new public health emergency. “Masks are fine, but we don’t need statewide mandates telling us what to do,” Fitzgerald said in a statement. “Many people are wearing masks already. Municipalities have been making the decisions themselves on what best fits their regions.” Fitzgerald’s comments came after three members of his caucus asked him to bring them back to the state Capitol to block Evers. “Governor Evers actions today are nothing more than a political stunt to create a partisan fight with the Legislature. This is not about improving public health,” Sen. Steve Nass of Whitewater said in a statement. … Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, said wearing a mask is “courteous and smart” but a pandemic doesn’t change legality. “Governor Evers, quite simply, lacks the legal authority to declare a second public health emergency and require every citizen to wear a mask,” he said. Emergency declarations issued by governors are good for 60 days. They can be extended or cut short by the Legislature. Lawmakers did not extend Evers’ first public health emergency declaration that was issued in March."
"If Lockdowns Work, Why Has California Seen ‘Spikes’ In COVID Cases?",31 JUL 2020,9556,"California continues to illegally restrict the liberties of free Americans in the name of ‘public health.’ The state’s lockdown orders are extremely invasive, preventing churchgoers from singing to God and families from attending loved ones, while ‘demonstrations’ are allowed to rage in the streets. So, it has led to questions about the effectiveness of ‘lockdowns.’ Just the News reported: Recent rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths in California has raised questions about whether the state’s strict pandemic mitigation measures — including a long-running lockdown, shuttering of countless businesses, and statewide mask mandate — have had much effect in countering the virus spread there. Gov. Gavin Newsom was the first governor in the country to issue a statewide stay-at-home order, directing all residents on March 19 to refrain from leaving their homes indefinitely. A few days before, he had ordered all bars and nightclubs in the state to close down, and had also slashed indoor dining occupancy limits by half. By that time many schools across the state had closed down, and at the beginning of April Newsom indicated that they would remain closed for the rest of the academic year. In mid-June, about six months after the pandemic officially landed in California, Newsom ordered all state residents to begin wearing face coverings while in public. Despite such measures, daily new cases in the state have continued to increase, growing slowly throughout April and May before beginning to skyrocket in mid-June, according to official state data. The accelerating rise in cases would seem to belie the Newsom administration’s claims that their mitigation efforts were critical in stopping the spread of the coronavirus in California. Six weeks after it was imposed, even Newsom’s mask mandate appears to have had little effect on the transmission of COVID-19 in his state. ‘We will get to herd immunity sooner or later’ Newsom’s efforts were part of a widespread push by U.S. governors in March and early April to “flatten the curve,” locking down huge swaths of society in the hope of spreading out the initial wave of coronavirus transmission over a longer period of time, avoiding a crushing surge of cases in order to save healthcare systems from collapsing under the weight of major patient influx. Most U.S. health experts at the time said that such policies were preferable to one of unregulated “herd immunity,” in which the virus is allowed to work its way through society unabated until a sufficient number of individuals have recovered from it, rendering the disease much less capable of spreading to new hosts. Some medical authorities argued that the virus could claim millions of lives before a sufficient level of immunity was reached. Since March, many authorities have shifted their mitigation strategies, effectively declaring an indefinite campaign against COVID-19 that could incorporate widespread closures, lockdowns and stay-at-home orders at any given time depending on a governor’s assessment of his or her state’s outbreaks. Newsom himself declared in a May press conference that the state was “not going back to normal” and that it had entered a “new normal, with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine.” Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a population medicine scholar at Harvard, believes prolonged lockdowns until a vaccine is developed are inadvisable. In late April, Kulldorff broke from academic orthodoxy with a column at Newsweek arguing that governments should consider a middle-of-the-road strategy: Allow younger populations to resume relatively normal activities, while older and vulnerable populations are directed to isolate — all in order to reach herd immunity and neutralize the major threat the virus poses. “I think it has to be done gradually, because if you suddenly release all lockdowns and countermeasures, we will overwhelm the hospitals,” Kulldorff told Just the News. “Herd immunity is not a strategy but a scientifically established phenomena,” he continued, “and with a pandemic, we will get there sooner or later, either with the help of a vaccine or through natural infections.” A vaccine, Kulldorff argued, is “the best way to generate herd immunity.” Yet, he pointed out, “the development of an effective and safe vaccine could take anything from six more months to never.” Kulldorff said that natural herd immunity “generated by low-risk individuals” could help move societies toward that goal while a vaccine is potentially developed. ‘We don’t know what level of immunity must be obtained’ Andrea LaCroix, the Chief of Epidemiology at the University of California, San Diego’s Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, argued on the other hand that such a strategy would be risky and potentially catastrophic in terms of the death count. “I’m all for herd immunity, whether it’s obtained from surviving infection or vaccine, but how many lives will we lose along the way?” she asked. “How do we minimize the number of lost lives?” Given the novelty of COVID-19, we “don’t know what level of immunity must be obtained for herd immunity to kick in to prevent spread of this particular virus,” LaCroix argued. “For measles it’s estimated at 94%,” she said. “For COVID-19, it’s still unknown.” LaCroix argued that broad stay-at-home orders should be in place, along with robust government assistance efforts to offset the economic fallout from widespread closures. When asked about California’s apparent failure to contain the virus even with its numerous heavy lockdown measures, LaCroix said that Newsom had been subject to “political pressure to reopen” before viral levels were sufficiently low throughout the state. “What was happening was that Gov. Newsom was pressured and threatened by Donald Trump,” LaCroix said. “There was a period of very intense pressure for him to stop the stay-at-home order. There were all these metrics counties were supposed to meet [for reopening], and in response to political pressure, Newsom let the counties petition to reopen with exceptions to the criteria.” Though it is not clear whether Trump pressured Newsom to lift the stay-at-home order, the governor did in mid-May relax the state’s strict reopening requirements for counties, allowing for a broader set of criteria by which local governments could move toward reopening. The relaxed guidelines, for instance, eliminated a requirement that a county must log no COVID-19 deaths over a two-week period, something many local leaders decried as unreasonable. It is not immediately evident that that decision had any major effect on California’s transmission rates: New cases did not begin increasing at a noticeably faster rate until a month after Newsom’s decision. Average daily deaths, meanwhile, declined over that time before beginning to increase in July. Kulldorff in the case of California said that it’s “important to distinguish between cases, hospitalizations and deaths,” arguing that the latter two are the more salient metrics by which to judge the disease’s progress through a given state. By those measures, California is plainly dealing with an active virus outbreak: Average deaths and total hospitalizations have both notably increased in the past six weeks, even though Newsom in mid-June ordered state residents to begin wearing masks while in public. LaCroix argued that “non-compliance” with state orders, particularly by gyms, has been driving some of the outbreaks. She also cited “gatherings at homes, churches and church services, and hospitals” as being hotbeds of transmission. “Any place where people are together for long periods face-to-face, there’s risk,” she said. The unexpected increase in cases frustrated Newsom so much that in early July he ordered restaurants and indoor businesses in nearly 20 counties to shut down; a week later, as cases continued upward, he ordered a statewide shutdown of indoor dining, movie theaters, wineries, museums and other entertainment venues. Since the second wave of shutdowns, daily new cases in the state, as well as hospitalizations, appear to have leveled off, mirroring similar trends in states such as Arizona and Texas. Whether or not Newsom’s policies have finally had an effect on the pandemic remains to be seen; authorities have stressed throughout the pandemic that case and death data only become reliable after one or two weeks’ worth of lag to allow for entry and refinement. LaCroix expressed pessimism over the patchwork efforts across the country to try and contain the virus over the past several months. “How many people are going to die under all these different ideas about how to control the pandemic?” she asked. “We’re already up to 150,000. It could be a million. It could be two million. Are we willing to tolerate — while we argue with each other about the right way to do this — that many deaths?” Kulldorff dismissed speculations about millions of fatalities. “Any estimates about the total number of deaths are just wild guesses that scientists should refrain from,” he said. “In my view,” he said, “it is precisely because it is a very serious and dangerous disease that we should reject the idea of a general lockdown, and instead be scientific and smart about it.” “With the current U.S. strategy,” he added, “we are protecting very low-risk children, college students and young professionals that can work from home, while high-risk older adults and the working class are slowly building herd immunity. That is not the way to minimize the number of deaths.”"
"Herman Cain, Cancer Survivor, Dies After Battle With COVID",31 JUL 2020,6921,"Herman Cain has passed away after battling COVID. Unfortunately, a number of liberals rejoiced over his death, but for anyone with a scrap of human emotion, his passing is a loss to the nation, and to us all. https://twitter.com/brinkofill/status/1288977843133784066?s=03   Hermancain.com reported: You’re never ready for the kind of news we are grappling with this morning. But we have no choice but to seek and find God’s strength and comfort to deal with it. Herman Cain – our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us – has passed away. He’s entering the presence of the Savior he’s served as an associate minister at Antioch Baptist Church in Atlanta, and preparing for his reward. Romans 2:6-7 says: “God ‘will repay each person according to what they have done.’ To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.” By that measure, we expect the boss is in for some kind of welcome, because all of us who knew him  are well aware of how much good he did. Let me deal with some of the particulars of the last few weeks. We knew when he was first hospitalized with COVID-19 that this was going to be a rough fight. He had trouble breathing and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We all prayed that the initial meds they gave him would get his breathing back to normal, but it became clear pretty quickly that he was in for a battle. We didn’t release detailed updates on his condition to the public or to the media because neither his family nor we thought there was any reason for that. There were hopeful indicators, including a mere five days ago when doctors told us they thought he would eventually recover, although it wouldn’t be quick. We were relieved to be told that, and passed on the news via Herman’s social media. And yet we also felt real concern about the fact that he never quite seemed to get to the point where the doctors could advance him to the recovery phase. Herman was 74. Although he was basically pretty healthy in recent years, he was still in a high-risk group because of his history with cancer. We all prayed so hard every day. We knew the time would come when the Lord would call him home, but we really liked having him here with us, and we held out hope he’d have a full recovery. Herman had just started hosting a new show on Newsmax TV. He was so excited about it, and so pumped up about playing a role in the 2020 election campaign. At an age when a lot of people are looking to slow down, he was taking on new projects, booking speaking opportunities. Ever the dealmaker, he would fill me in with details of his negotiations with people on any number of things. I would always tell him I should have him negotiate my deals with my business’s other clients, because he did them better than anyone. The last time I talked to him was when he was getting ready to start the Newsmax show. He was really pumped about it, and I was happy for him because he’d walked away from a nice contributor gig at Fox a couple years early to head a Super PAC. When that ran its course, Herman really wanted to get back into TV, and this afforded him a beautiful opportunity. Alas, he only ever got to host one episode. But there was so much more to him than the public saw, and certainly more than the media presented to you. Most people heard of Herman for the first time when he ran for president in 2011. What they didn’t know was his business background. They didn’t know how he had started his career as a civilian employee of the Navy. It was funny to us because sometimes political pundits portrayed him as kind of a goof – having no idea that during his time working for the Navy, he was literally a rocket scientist. Many people don’t know about his years climbing the corporate ladder at Pillsbury, at Burger King and finally as CEO of Godfather’s Pizza. I will always remember the first time I became aware of him. It was 12 years before I worked with him for the first time. It was the now-famous encounter between Herman and Bill Clinton in which the boss schooled the president on the finer points of small-business finance, and I can’t describe it any better than I can just let you watch it: Herman could handle himself in a situation like that because he knew who he was, and he wasn’t intimidated by anyone, including the president of the United States. Advertisement – story continues below When I launched the North Star Writers Group syndicate in 2005, I was looking for good writers and thinkers who were not signed to syndicates, and I was surprised to learn that Herman Cain – the guy who had schooled Bill Clinton on national TV – was a free agent. I tracked down contact information for him and told his office I would like to syndicate him. Two days later I had a signed contract, and it kicked off a 15-year professional relationship and friendship that I will treasure for the rest of my life. It was only a few months later that he informed me of his cancer diagnosis, but he assured me he would continue writing his column every week. Even though I told him that was the last thing he needed to concern himself with, he did it. He never told me he would do something that he didn’t come through on. In 2007, my business was struggling and I was having a hard time finding a direction for it. Herman welcomed me to come see him in Atlanta, and he spent an entire day with me going over the particulars of my business. Together we drew up an action plan, and he gave me some firm and pointed advice on some things I needed to do. This guy had helped lead some of the biggest companies in the world, and he could have charged massive consulting fees for this sort of thing. But he did it all for free, and he kept working with me over the years to make sure things stayed on the right track. I haven’t even gotten into his experiences as what he called an ABC – an American Black Conservative – because his politics seems so low on the list of things I want to tell you about him right now. He was one of the most important figures to ever come into my life, and I can’t wrap my head, or my heart, around the fact that he’s gone. I don’t think I’ll be able to for a long time. But I want you to understand just what our world has lost today. There aren’t many people like Herman Cain, and it behooves us to truly cherish the ones we’re given. His wife Gloria – his children Melanie and Vincent – and his grandchildren . . . they need our love, our support and our prayers. Nothing I talked about above meant as much to him as these wonderful people did, and because he loved them so much, we will continue to feel his impact on the world through them. I’m sorry I had to bring you bad news this morning. But the good news is that we had a man so good, so solid, so full of love and faith . . . that his death hits us this hard. Thank God for a man like that. Rest well in His presence, Boss. We love you."
UN Cites Studies Showing Virus Lockdowns Killing More Children Than COVID,30 JUL 2020,3127,"Democrats and liberals around the country are fighting to continue unlawful lockdowns, but officials at the United Nations have cited a study that proves such tactics are more deadly to children than the actual virus. School closures are doing more harm than good, making many people wonder just how many people democrats want to see dead. Summit News reported: In a presentation seeking extra funding for coronavirus efforts, UNICEF director Henrietta H Fore said Monday, “The repercussions of the pandemic are causing more harm to children than the disease itself.” UNICEF nutrition program chief Victor Aguayo noted that the most harm is being done “by having schools closed, by having primary health care services disrupted, by having nutritional programs dysfunctional.” The officials pointed to a study published in The Lancet that notes “physical distancing, school closures, trade restrictions, and country lockdowns” are worsening global child malnutrition. The study estimates that an extra 6.7 million children will be at risk, and that lockdowns and other coronavirus responses could lead to more than 10,000 additional child deaths every month. The UNICEF officials noted that would mean 128,000 more deaths among children within the next year. Study: Global Lockdowns Killing 10,000 Children Per Monthhttps://t.co/GG9DWHZpeY — Dan Bongino (@dbongino) July 28, 2020 The study complies research from the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It concludes that shut down strategies could lead to “life-long impacts on education, chronic disease risks, and overall human capital formation,” in addition to “intergenerational consequences for child growth and development.” The estimates are said to “likely to be conservative, given that the duration of this crisis is unknown, and its full impacts on food, health, and social protection systems are yet to be realized.” The study dovetails with other research that has concluded lockdowns will conservatively “destroy at least seven times more years of human life” than they save. The German government has concluded that the impact of the country’s lockdown could end up killing more people than the coronavirus due to victims of other serious illnesses not receiving treatment. As we have previously highlighted, in the UK there have already been up to 10,000 excess deaths as a result of seriously ill people avoiding hospitals due to COVID-19 or not having their hospital treatments cancelled. A data analyst consortium in South Africa also found that the economic consequences of the country’s lockdown will lead to 29 times more people dying than the coronavirus itself. Hundreds of doctors are also on record as opposing lockdown measures, warning that they will cause more death than the coronavirus itself. While globalists have urged that lockdowns need to continue, medical and economic experts across the board in multiple countries are warning that the loss of life will be much greater than that caused directly by the virus itself, if lockdowns are not scrapped."

Many people argue that Twitter should have this disclaimer on their platform, since a group of doctors and medical professionals as well as well-known Prager U have now had their accounts suspended. The accounts “violated” the twitter rule that specifically applies to a life-saving medicine, hydroxychloroquine. Breitbart News reported: Twitter temporarily suspended the accounts of PragerU and a variety of prominent conservatives and even a doctor on Wednesday after they tweeted videos of doctors commenting on the effectiveness of the drug Hydroxychloroquine or otherwise commented on the drug. Conservative non-profit group PragerU had its account restricted on Wednesday for allegedly violating the platform’s rules regarding posts about coronavirus after sharing a video of the “White Coat Summit” featuring medical doctors. “American doctors are holding a ‘White Coat Summit’ in Washington, D.C. to address ‘a massive disinformation campaign’ by the media about coronavirus,” read PragerU’s tweet. “Watch as Dr. Stella Immanuel tackles the media’s narrative about hydroxychloroquine.” Director and producer Robby Starbuck was suspended from Twitter on Wednesday after replying to someone, “I guess you think Dr. Harvey Risch, an epidemiology professor at Yale School of Public Health isn’t a real doctor? He’s also touting that Hydroxychloroquine works.” Starbuck was later notified by Twitter that his tweet had violated the Twitter Rules regarding “the policy on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,” and that his account had been temporarily restricted from tweeting. Well, @robbystarbuck has been temporary suspended. This tweet is an objective fact. Not even opinion or a claim of efficacy, just a fact that the doctor/epidemiologist from Yale is backing it. pic.twitter.com/KFpzjAFy6i — Kambree (@KamVTV) July 29, 2020 Dr. David Samadi was also suspended from Twitter after violating rules regarding information about the Chinese coronavirus. “If people hate President Trump, that is entirely their prerogative,” tweeted Samadi. “When their hatred causes them to deliberately hide good news about a life-saving treatment for a global pandemic, that is when the line is crossed. Hydroxychloroquine works and it has worked.” Samadi received a notification from Twitter informing him that his account had been restricted for violating the Twitter Rules regarding COVID-19. Moreover, Australian-American author Nick Adams was also suspended from the platform, for tweeting, “Hydroxychloroquine SAVES lives! Rt!” Adams was notified by Twitter on Wednesday that he had been banned from issuing tweets for the next 12 hours. The suspensions arrive just days after Google and social media platforms censored a livestreamed video posted by Breitbart News of a press conference held in Washington, D.C. on Monday by the group America’s Frontline Doctors. Following the censorship, Twitter restricted the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr.’s account for 12 hours after he shared the a viral video clip of Monday’s press conference with the doctors on Capitol Hill. Republican strategist and Trump Jr. spokesman Andrew Surabian posted a screenshot sharing the update that Trump Jr. received on his Twitter account: BREAKING: @Twitter & @jack have suspended @DonaldJTrumpJr for posting a viral video of medical doctors talking about Hydroxychloroquine. Big Tech is the biggest threat to free expression in America today & they’re continuing to engage in open election interference – full stop. pic.twitter.com/7dJbauq43O — Andrew Surabian (@Surabees) July 28, 2020 Breitbart News has requested comment from Twitter, but did not receive a reply at the time of publication."
Don’t Plant Them: Mysterious Chinese Seed Packets Present Serious Danger,29 JUL 2020,2669,"Last week, rumors of a Chinese scheme to cripple American food production circulated, claiming that aggressive seeds were being sent to individuals all over the country that would (if planted) multiply quickly and essentially destroy the ground and make it unfruitful for any other crops. However, it’s not just a conspiracy theory. It’s real. Seeds are showing up all over, packaged as “jewelry” and government officials say they shouldn’t even be opened. KHOU reported: Unsolicited seeds have been showing up in mailboxes in multiple states across the country, but officials say they should be reported – not planted. Officials in multiple states are warning the public to be cautious of mystery seeds reportedly arriving in the United States from China. They’ve been received in multiple states, including Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia, Washington and Texas. On Monday, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller urged Texans to take extreme precautions when receiving unsolicited seed packets from China that are falsely labeled as jewelry. Miller said residents are advised not to plant the seeds as they could contain harmful invasive species or be otherwise unsafe. “I am urging folks to take this matter seriously,” Miller said. “An invasive plant species might not sound threatening, but these small invaders could destroy Texas agriculture. TDA has been working closely with USDA to analyze these unknown seeds so we can protect Texas residents.” If someone receives one of these packages, they are asked to report it to agriculture officials immediately. Those who receive the seeds are instructed to put them in an airtight bag and ship them to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services’ division of Plant Protection Quarantine. On July 24, the Washington State Department of Agriculture posted a similar warning on its Facebook page: “Today we received reports of people receiving seeds in the mail from China that they did not order. The seeds are sent in packages usually stating that the contents are jewelry. Unsolicited seeds could be invasive, introduce diseases to local plants, or be harmful to livestock. Here’s what to do if you receive unsolicited seeds from another country: 1) DO NOT plant them and if they are in sealed packaging (as in the photo below) don’t open the sealed package. 2) This is known as agricultural smuggling. Report it to USDA and maintain the seeds and packaging until USDA instructs you what to do with the packages and seeds. They may be needed as evidence. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/import-information/sa_sitc/ct_antismuggling “ Crazy."
“White Coat Summit” Dr: “99.8 Percent Of People Get Through This” Without Getting Horribly Sick,28 JUL 2020,2477,"Yesterday, Dr. Dan Erickson, owner of Accelerated Urgent Care, spoke at the “White Coat Summit” on Capitol Hill. The video of his remarks have been removed from social media because they contain facts leftists are desperate to stop people from knowing. Breitbart News reported: Erickson addressed the dominant narrative of rising cases of the virus within the U.S. and pointed out that it is causing undue fear. “A case is a person, healthy, that tested positive. The vast majority. But the public hears cases and thinks, ‘Oh my goodness. These are sick people!’ No the vast majority — 99.8 percent of people get through this with little to no progressive or significant disease,” Erickson said. The focus should not center on cases, he continued. Rather, the narrative should focus on hospitalizations and deaths that “are appropriately coded on a death certificate,” he said, stressing “appropriately coded.” “This is the first time I’ve seen quarantining healthy,” he continued. “I don’t know if you guys think that’s normal. I find that very strange.” While he said it was good that the U.S. prepared for the worse, Erickson said we must be “realistic with the response.” “Who showed up? Most of the patients that were showing up for me were very mild illness,” he said, adding that he wanted to come out and “give reality to the situation on the ground and sort of help dispel some fear that people have had.” Erickson also addressed the mass lockdowns across the country, explaining that they were “very successful,” but in all the wrong metrics: He said: Was the lockdown successful? I say yes very successful. Successful in things like this. Anxiety hotline calls up 1000 percent. Child abuse both sexual and non up. Financially, emotional distress, Suicide. Alcohol. 150,000 Americans a month not receiving cancer screening. It’s been effective alright, in all the wrong metrics — in all the areas we didn’t want it to be effective. Delay in medical care. We talked about that. Orthopedics, nonessential. Suicide calls up 600 percent. Suicide calls. We heard other doctors mention this. So was the lockdown effective? If that’s the effect you were going for, then yes but it was trying to flatten the curve but it had these secondary consequences that I think are devastating. People staying indoors. No exercising as you mentioned. No Vitamin D. “I’m watching people in their Prius by themselves driving with a mask on. There’s no sense to it,” he added. “It’s fear.”"
"Exposed: BLM Curriculum Discovered In California Grade Schools, Parents Push Back",28 JUL 2020,10214,"In a disgusting discovery, parents in California have learned that Black Lives Matter propaganda is being used as curriculum in schools. The highly leftist teaching materials are designed for one thing only, these parents argue, bringing on a communist society in America as quickly as possible. Red State reported: *I am an immigrant who came from Korea. I serve many Korean families in Orange County through Children’s Ministries. Many Asians came here for a better life in America. Many risked their lives to escape a Communistic Regime. Communism uses propaganda to control people’s thinking. They control the media outlets and distort truth. They are mass manipulators for the sake of governmental oppression. They turn kids against their parents. I have lived in America for two decades and I can tell you, we are tip toeing on the edge of socialistic communism. This breaks my heart for America. The unions are behind these beliefs and yet teachers are too busy to notice. Teachers might think their union protects them, but when oppression ripens, no one is immune from its captivity. – Jinah Yi, Orange Unified School District parent, California. Brenda Lebsack has been a teacher in Orange County, California for over twenty-five years, and most recently a board member in the Orange Unified School District (OUSD). Lebsack has been increasingly concerned about the progressive political creep into California education and as a member of the union has been very forward in voicing her opinion that the current political agenda in California schools is robbing students of a quality education. Recently Lebsack sounded the alarm in her school district after discovering and reviewing the proposed new Black Lives Matter (BLM) curriculum that is being floated as a part of the new school year. Says Lebsack in an exclusive statement to Redstate: The National and state teachers union endorses Black Lives Matter and their K-12 curriculum.  Within the BLM curriculum are teachings that Gender is the child’s CHOICE based on the child’s feelings.  These choices encompass: Boy, Girl, Both, Neither or SOMETHING ELSE.  (The CDE says this choice can be made as young as TWO). The NEA partners with the Human Rights Campaign who has created preschool lessons teaching unlimited gender choices.  The National Educators Association and ACSA (Administrators Calif School Association) recommend these “welcoming school” lessons for our primary school children. Parents and many school employees pushed back against the BLM insurgence in their own district last month when BLM organizations began issuing guidelines for new curriculums and included a push to completely defund police presence in LAUSD schools. Having failed in Los Angeles (for now), BLM activists have been focusing on pushing their curriculum and political agenda into other districts. Last Thursday night, the Orange Unified School District held a meeting to discuss (among other agenda items) the plans for reopening campuses. A shockingly diverse and large group of parents logged into the virtual platform in force to express their concerns about the disturbing new curriculum incursions brought to their attention by Lebsack. *I am a Lesbian parent and grandparent...Please do not assume all LGBTQ individuals think alike politically. Just as teachers are very diverse in their opinions and political affiliations, so are people who identify as LGBT. As a Lesbian parent and grandparent, I am not in favor of Black Lives Matter Curriculum in Schools that the Teachers Union (CTA and NEA) endorses. First of all, BLM promotes gender ideologies I feel are harmful to children. Their mission statement says they want to DISMANTLE the idea that gender is biologically determined. WHY? They say their movement is based on SCIENCE, yet their Science says kids can CHOOSE their gender as boy, girl, BOTH, NEITHER or SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING ELSE?!? That’s an OPEN ENDED Pandora Box. What kind of science does BLM practice? – Christina Gonzalez, OUSD parent, California The NEA and the CTA have already given their stamp of approval to BLM curriculum resources. That means those resources will be added to the resource library of every district in the state, leaving the decision to teach the agenda up to individual schools and teachers. Not one parent or legislator voted on the appropriateness of the lessons, but simply by virtue of being available in the resource library, it is now a legal part of the California public education resource. * I am a concerned member of the community who is also African-American…The last thing our children , from Kindergarten all the way to High School, need is to be feed any curriculum that seeks to indoctrinate and propagandize towards a Marxist/ultra progressive agenda. Our children need exposure to ideas that celebrate cultural diversity, community, care, forgiveness and free-thought.Our kids and their parents do not have a one size fits all life experience. Even among our families of color, political though and ideas are as diverse as their culture. I am afraid the very narrow focused BLM curriculum, will train our children to become radicalized and rob them of the ability to think for themselves and to have a more diverse, balanced and effective understanding of race, equality and social justice concerns. –S. Turner, Orange County, California Teaching about equality and racial injustice seems benign and even necessary to the logical thinker. That is until one actually sees the approved BLM lesson guides as promoted by the NEA and CTA. Not only does the agenda include baldly communist talking points, it oddly includes the wedging in of gay and transgender centered curriculum and activism. *These concepts do not belong in the schools. Parents can teach their kids at home according to their family, cultural or religious values. The teachers union endorsement of BLM curriculum is an assault on parental rights and an assault on the fiber of our country – Gheorghe Rosca, OUSD parent, California A cursory perusal of the CTA’s classroom resources yields so much heavy-handed BLM jargon that it is nearly impossible to isolate just one thing that could set parents on edge for the new school year. You can view their resources, talking points, and recommendations here. Here is one “educational” graphic that defines white supremacy in its overt and covert forms. Some of the more eye-raising offenses on the white supremacy list include: The teachers union endorsed AB 329, the Calif Healthy Youth Act, which removed the requirement of Parent Permission Slips for Sex Education for ALL grades levels. How is this in the best interest of parents and families? The Teachers Union now endorses Black Lives Matter. Though it might sound great from the outside, that candy coating melts fast when you look inside. – Jade Ausmus, OUSD parent, California The list goes on and on and feels more like a Marxist talking point list with every passing letter. The CTA page also provides a very helpful glossary of social justice terms (and redefine “racism” while they’re at it) that teachers can use to help their classroom discussions. Decolonization: Work toward undoing, dismantling the effects of the oppressor/oppressed regime or structures imposed by a colonial power. For a classroom, this can mean unlearning and removing oppressive curriculum, language, images, norms, etc. (Sources 1 Racism: A system (consisting of structures, policies, practices and norms) that structures opportunity and assigns value based on socially constructed categories of people. It unfairly disadvantages some individuals and communities and provides advantages and access to others. The system of racism does not allow the realization of one’s full potential because it denies access to resources, power and privilege. Whiteness: Like race, whiteness is a social construct rather than an essential characteristic or biological fact; is used as cultural property, and provides resources, power and privilege to those who are considered white, pass as white, or are given “honorary” white status White Fragility: Describes the disbelieving defensiveness that white people exhibit when their ideas about race and racism are challenged—and particularly when they feel implicated in white supremacy. (Source: Robin DiAngelo). “White tears” are a symptom of white fragility. White Privilege: The resources, power and privilege provided to people who are considered white; an exemption of social, political, and/or economic burdens placed on BIPOC; benefiting from societal structuring that prioritizes white people and whiteness. White Savior Complex: Refers to a white person who assumes that folks of color need their “help” and “saving.” We see this trope play out in the media, racist curriculum and histories, choices made about traveling abroad, foreign policy, organizational structures and more. (Sources: 1 2) White Supremacy: A historically based, institutionally perpetuated system of exploitation and oppression of continents, nations and peoples of color by white people for the purpose of maintaining and defending a system of resources, power and privilege. Perhaps the biggest indictment against the Black Lives Matter curriculum incursion (outside of its unapologetic communist core) is the inclusion of LGBT issues that, in fact, are not embraced by the Black community in general, and no student group is off-limits. The NEA has also posted to their library coloring books for pre-school and elementary students in multiple languages that include Marxist ideation, buzzwords, and LGBT-driven issues. For high schoolers, curriculum materials can include gems like this essay on why white people hate protests and a reading guide for Marxist thought. The story continues to unfold under the noses of overwhelmed parents across the state and country. It is clear that few people in power are stopping to even take a breath before fundamentally changing the trajectory of the American public school system. If the parents at Thursday night’s school board meeting are any indication, the teachers’ unions and the state dictators may have a bigger fight on their hands than they were prepared for."
"Social Media Makes War On Dr’s: Video Of Conference Scrubbed From FB, Twitter, YouTube",28 JUL 2020,3588,"Yesterday, a group of frontline doctors spoke on Capitol Hill about the effectiveness, and essential “cure” we already have for coronavirus… hydroxychloroquine. Immediately, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook started removing the video from social media because it “violated” their terms of agreement. The violation? Saying “There is a cure!” Breitbart News reported: Facebook has removed a video posted by Breitbart News earlier today, which was the top-performing Facebook post in the world Monday afternoon, of a press conference in D.C. held by the group America’s Frontline Doctors and organized and sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots. The press conference featured Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and frontline doctors sharing their views and opinions on coronavirus and the medical response to the pandemic. YouTube (which is owned by Google) and Twitter subsequently removed footage of the press conference as well. The video accumulated over 17 million views during the eight hours it was hosted on Facebook, with over 185,000 concurrent viewers. In terms of viral velocity, the post was beating content from many other prominent accounts on Facebook today, including Hillary Clinton, Rev. Franklin Graham, and Kim Kardashian. The event, hosted by the organization America’s Frontline Doctors, a group founded by Dr. Simone Gold, a board-certified physician and attorney, and made up of medical doctors, came together to address what the group calls a “massive disinformation campaign” about the coronavirus. Norman also spoke at the event. “If Americans continue to let so-called experts and media personalities make their decisions, the great American experiment of a Constitutional Republic with Representative Democracy, will cease,” reads the event’s information page. The event was organized and sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots. “We’ve removed this video for sharing false information about cures and treatments for COVID-19,” a Facebook company spokesman, Andy Stone, told Breitbart News. The company did not specify what portion of the video it ruled to be “false information,” who it consulted to make that ruling, and on what basis it was made. [Apparently, a Yale doctor doesn’t count.] Stone replied to New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose on Twitter regarding the video: Yes, we removed it for sharing false information about cures and treatments for COVID-19. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) July 28, 2020 Stone then added that the platform would direct users who had interacted with the post to information on “myths debunked by the WHO.” Also, one other thing to note. We’re showing messages in News Feed to people who have reacted to, commented on or shared harmful COVID-19-related misinformation that we have removed, connecting them to myths debunked by the WHO. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) July 28, 2020 Facebook’s decision to censor the livestream was quickly followed by YouTube, the Google-owned video-sharing platform. The video had over 80,000 views on YouTube prior to its removal. Following Facebook and YouTube’s removal of the video, Twitter followed suit, removing Breitbart News’s Periscope livestream of the press conference. Jack Dorsey’s platform also then limited the Breitbart News official account, indicating that tweets containing links to multiple stories about the press conference violate the platform’s COVID-19 policies. A few savvy users downloaded some of the clips, however, and you can still watch it on some platforms. Truly, it is crucial to watch: You can still watch the full video here: https://www.bitchute.com/video/ukmtlokiGHRr/  "
Yale Professor Confirms Hydroxychloroquine Is “Key To Defeating COVID”,27 JUL 2020,7356,"The media apparently has a vested interest in killing as many people as possible. This is the only logical deduction, given their support of ‘protests’ and their sweeping condemnation of the only drug shown to be effective against COVID 19. In fact, Harvey Risch, professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health explained that hydroxychloroquine is “the key to defeating COVID-19” in a Newsweek op-ed published last week. He lamented that medical information has been politicized, resulting in more deaths. PJ Media reported: “I am usually accustomed to advocating for positions within the mainstream of medicine, so have been flummoxed to find that, in the midst of a crisis, I am fighting for a treatment that the data fully support but which, for reasons having nothing to do with a correct understanding of the science, has been pushed to the sidelines,” Risch wrote. “As a result, tens of thousands of patients with COVID-19 are dying unnecessarily. Fortunately, the situation can be reversed easily and quickly.” And it can be reversed by the same medication that has become unnecessarily politicized by the media and the Democratic Party over the past several months. “When this inexpensive oral medication is given very early in the course of illness, before the virus has had time to multiply beyond control, it has shown to be highly effective,” Risch explained. “Especially when given in combination with the antibiotics azithromycin or doxycycline and the nutritional supplement zinc.” Earlier this month, a large peer-reviewed study found that hydroxychloroquine cut the mortality rate of COVID-19 by more than half and, contrary to previous claims by faulty studies, had no adverse effects on the heart. For months the media has ignored both scientific and anecdotal evidence of the drug’s efficacy in treating COVID-19. The war on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine began almost immediately after Trump touted it as a potential gamechanger in the fight against the disease. Trump was accused of “practicing medicine without a license” simply for pointing out that the drug showed promise in some small studies. The New York Times even alleged that Trump’s motivation for touting the drug was self-serving because he holds “a small personal financial interest” in Sanofi, even though the drug is out of patent (any pharmaceutical company can manufacture it) and he only owned $29 – $435 in stock as part of a mutual fund. Because the media and the Democratic Party wanted to use the pandemic to thwart Trump’s reelection, any positive news had to be buried. Trump was accused of offering false hope and “selling snake oil” to the public. A Democratic state lawmaker in Ohio even said Trump should be tried for “crimes against humanity” for touting the drug. The media gave lots of coverage to studies that associated hydroxychloroquine with a higher mortality rate. In April, the results of a U.S. Veterans Health Administration study on the benefits of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 were released. The study analyzed the impact of hydroxychloroquine with and without the antibiotic azithromycin and compared that to COVID-19 patients receiving standard care. The VA study found there were “more deaths” among those given hydroxychloroquine than those who just received standard care. However, the VA study wasn’t a clinical trial, but a small, non-peer-reviewed study of patients who were not representative of the entire population, and those with more severe COVID-19 cases were disproportionally administered the drug. The media was so focused on how they could use the pandemic to undermine Trump’s chances of reelection that they rushed to downplay any sign of hope, which may have prevented the drug from being used to save lives. Anti-hydroxychloroquine hysteria by the media made finding volunteers for studies difficult. Meanwhile, evidence of the drug’s effectiveness was conveniently and repeatedly ignored. The media ignored a survey of doctors back in May that found an overwhelming majority of them “would prescribe hydroxychloroquine or another anti-malaria drug to a family member” suffering from the coronavirus. The media ignored other success stories of coronavirus patients who recovered after being treated with the drug. For example, in April, a Democrat lawmaker in Detroit, Mich., credited the drug and President Trump with saving her life. State Rep. Karen Whitsett, who tested positive for COVID-19 in March, had been aware of  “the wonders” of hydroxychloroquine after a previous Lyme disease affliction, but would never have thought to ask for a prescription for it to treat the coronavirus had Trump not been touting it as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Whitsett took the drug in combination with antibiotics and made a full recovery. Other coronavirus patients have reported dramatic recoveries after taking the drug. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who has also been critical of Trump’s touting of hydroxychloroquine, was successfully treated for COVID-19 with a less safe version of the drug. In May, multiple studies claimed that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine was linked to higher rates of mortality with coronavirus patients. In response to this study, the World Health Organization and many national governments changed their policies and treatment guidelines, effectively halting trials of the drug, and shelving it as a coronavirus treatment. But it turned out that those studies were based on possibly bogus data from a small America-based company called Surgisphere. Dr. Risch is very much aware of the reasons why hydroxychloroquine has been “disregarded.” “First, as all know, the medication has become highly politicized. For many, it is viewed as a marker of political identity, on both sides of the political spectrum,” he noted. “Nobody needs me to remind them that this is not how medicine should proceed. We must judge this medication strictly on the science. When doctors graduate from medical school, they formally promise to make the health and life of the patient their first consideration, without biases of race, religion, nationality, social standing—or political affiliation. Lives must come first.” “Second, the drug has not been used properly in many studies,” he said. “Hydroxychloroquine has shown major success when used early in high-risk people but, as one would expect for an antiviral, much less success when used late in the disease course.” Risch continued, “Even so, it has demonstrated significant benefit in large hospital studies in Michigan and New York City when started within the first 24 to 48 hours after admission.” Risch believes the scientific community will look back on the hydroxychloroquine controversy poorly.  “In the future, I believe this misbegotten episode regarding hydroxychloroquine will be studied by sociologists of medicine as a classic example of how extra-scientific factors overrode clear-cut medical evidence.” That’s a nice way of saying the Democrats and the media, by politicizing the drug, are responsible for countless unnecessary deaths. President Trump had the answer to defeating COVID-19 months ago. The Democratic Party and the media didn’t want it to be true and did everything they could to scare the public about the drug, letting thousands of people die just to help Joe Biden win the election."
Audit Shows Fauci’s Agency Failed ‘Several Times’ To Comply With Federal Laws,24 JUL 2020,3632,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, many people claim, is simply a deep state stooge, parroting what he is told and hyping COVID fears in order to damage President Trump. Now, his record as an unelected official is causing many raised brows, given that his agency repeatedly broke federal contract laws. Just The News reported: The National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, the federal agency headed by longtime public health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, has been cited several times over the years for failing to comply with federal contract and expenditure laws, internal government audits reveal. As scrutiny of Fauci’s role in managing the pandemic grows, the nation’s infectious disease specialist has defended himself by citing his long record in government. But that record includes several ethics and patient safety controversies on his watch as well as numerous citations for violating contract “time” and “amount” rules and the Anti-Deficiency Act, a federal law. A 2011 report by the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general is emblematic of the repeated problems. Investigators examined a $54.8 million, multi-year federal contract to help Fauci’s agency build and manage a statistical and data coordinating center for medical research project and found NIAID spent tax dollars before they were appropriated by Congress and didn’t account for monies as required by federal regulations. “NIAID did not comply with the time and the amount requirements specified in the statutes. NIAID violated both the bona fide needs rule and the Anti-Deficiency Act by obligating funds in advance of an appropriation,” the IG concluded, ordering Fauci’s agency to report to Congress it had violated the law. NIH admitted the failures. IGReport2011NIADReport.pdf Similarly, a 2012 IG report found a $244.5 million multiyear contract NIAID executed for research support wrongly spent monies it did not legally have in one year and failed to spending moneys Congress had ordered for subsequent years. “NIAID violated the Anti-Deficiency Act by obligating $8.6 million of the $20.9 million in advance of an appropriation and may have violated the Anti-Deficiency Act by obligating significantly less of appropriate fiscal year funds in program years 2 and 4 than required by either the Contract estimate or the actual expenditures incurred,” investigators concluded. IGAudit2012NIAID.pdf The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies “from obligating or expending any amount in advance of or in excess of an appropriation unless specifically authorized by law.” Each violation must be reported to Congress and the president. The audits, which covered multiple contracts stretching between 2005 and 2012, attributed the violations to poor training, and “widespread misunderstanding of appropriations laws because of conflicting …. guidance over the past 25 years.” A spokeswoman for Fauci did not return repeated emails seeking comment. Fauci has been known across America for several months as a key figures in the government’s fight against the coronavirus, serving as a leading representative of the White House’s coronavirus task force and having been described as a “de facto leader” of the country’s pandemic strategy. Yet he has been known longer as the director of the NIAID, the leadership of which he assumed in 1984. His work into AIDS research in particular has been hailed as critical in the fight against that disease. Just the News reported Wednesday, however, multiple congressional, government ethics and internal watchdogs found safety or ethics lapses on NIAID research projects dating to 1992, including"
Trump Acts To Save Black Lives As Chicago Homicides Overwhelmingly Black,24 JUL 2020,7366,"According to new data, the homicide numbers in Chicago have steadily increased, and the group most impacted by it has been African Americans. Democrat leaders in the city are apparently fine with the numbers continuing to climb, but President Trump is not. He is sending federal troops to help stop the deaths. Fox News reported: As gun violence in Chicago increased exponentially over the past decade, African Americans were overwhelmingly impacted. Local leaders continue to grapple with how to combat the spike while opposing plans by the Trump administration to deploy federal agents to the city. From Jan. 1, 2010 through July 8 of this year, Black homicide victims accounted for 4,374 of the city’s murders, according to figures provided by the Chicago Police Department to Fox News. The second-largest group impacted by gun violence — Hispanics and Black Hispanics — totaled 785 murder victims over the same period. The murder rate of Black victims held steady, never surpassing 400 annually until 2016. That year, 607 Black people were killed, according to police. From Jan. 1 through July 8, the city reported 291 Black people killed. White people had significantly lower homicide numbers followed by people of Asian descent and Native Americans. While many cities saw their crime rates plummet in recent years, Chicago was making headlines for upticks in shootings and murders. On May 31, while most communities were steeped in protests over the killing of George Floyd, Chicago saw 85 people shot and 18 killed over a 24-hour period, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab. The figures made it the deadliest day in the city in six decades. The Crime Lab numbers only go as far back as 1961. Garry McCarthy, the former Chicago police superintendent who was fired in 2015, said he came to the job with a crime-fighting strategy similar to the one implemented by the New York Police Department, where he held executive positions. The NYPD’s tactics, some of which were highly controversial, contributed to major reductions in crime in the 1990s and 2000s, making New York one of America’s safest cities. “It’s not heavy-handed policing, it’s intelligent policing. It’s about data-driven policing… knowing where to be to prevent the next shooting,” McCarthy told Fox News. McCarthy was appointed Chicago’s top cop in 2011 and was fired in 2015 amid criticism over the shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald at the hands of officer Jason Van Dyke. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel credited McCarthy with driving crime down while noting he’d lost the public trust. According to data provided by Chicago police, murders spiked significantly following McCarthy’s exit, from 491 in 2015 to 778 in 2016. In 2017, the city reported 659 homicides and 577 in 2018. As of July 8, Chicago experienced 364 murders this year. The figures come during a nationwide reckoning over the role of police in society and how they treat people of color sparked by the May 25 death of Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. Some progressive leaders and racial justice activists have called for defunding police departments so that law enforcement budgets can be diverted to community resources, housing and other social programs. Some cities have enacted legislation to limit police use of force and press for greater accountability of officers. The Chicago Police Department did not respond to a Fox News request for comment about the uptick in murders and violent crime. Chicago’s murder rate and the increase in shootings are telling. As the overall crime rate decreased during stay-at-home orders to combat the coronavirus pandemic, shootings were still up in May and June. Shootings increased 71 percent in May and murders by 60 percent. “The narrative was, unlike many people who stayed at home, and because of that reduced the likelihood of victimization, people in those adversely impacted communities with respect to Covid and crime didn’t necessarily change” their behavior, David Olson, a professor of criminal justice and criminology at Loyola University Chicago, told Fox News. Tio Hardiman, executive director of Violence Interrupters, a community-based organization focused on decreasing violent crimes in cities throughout the nation, said he wasn’t surprised by the police data, and noted, “it’s been this way for a long time.” “My theory is that it’s a Black man’s responsibility to reduce the gun violence in their communities,” Hardiman, a Chicago resident who is Black, told Fox News. “You see, a lot of us continue to wait on the police to stop the killing. We continue to wait on programs to stop the killings. But it’s really all about [how] the Black man must rise up to the occasion and really address the issue of gun violence in our community. The numbers will never surprise me.” He stressed that the loss of one life is one too many. “I do think there’s a little something different in the air right now because it appears that there’s no method to the madness that’s going on across the nation, like in New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, a lot of different cities,” he said. “What’s going on is that it’s learned behavior. It’s passed down from generation to generation … you have people out here now that are shooting just to shoot people. That’s what makes it more dangerous.” Hardiman added that young Black men “are crying out for help now.” “There’s the need for some sort of justice-type of programing here in the city of Chicago,” he said. “What I would like to recommend for politicians and community thought leaders, to pretty much take a good look at restorative justice, because that might be the wave of the future when it comes down to really trying to reduce gun violence out here in major cities across the United States.” To combat the uptick in crime, President Trump said he will deploy federal agents to Chicago despite opposition from Mayor Lori Lightfoot and local leaders. The move is part of Operation Legend, which deploys federal forces to cities experiencing upticks in violence. Several groups have filed lawsuits to block federal intervention into matters they argue should be handled by local authorities. Agents are already placed in Portland, Ore., and Kanas City, Mo. In addition to Chicago, the Justice Department also added Albuquerque, N.M., to the list. “The effort to shut down police in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killing, violence, murders,” Trump said of Chicago during a speech at the White House this week. In a letter earlier this month, Trump blasted Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, accusing the Democratic leaders of putting their interests above public safety and likened the Chicago to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. “Your lack of leadership on this important issue continues to fail the people you have sworn to protect,” Trump wrote. Lightfoot’s office said she spoke with Trump following his announcement and made it clear that if there is any deviation from what has been announced, she will pursue all available legal options to protect Chicagoans. The president’s announcement came a day after gunfire erupted outside a funeral home in Chicago’s Auburn Gresham neighborhood the left 15 people wounded. Hours later, a 3-year-old girl was shot in the head while in a car with her parents."
Fauci’s First Pitch Matches His COVID Claims-Total Failure,24 JUL 2020,1642,"As much as I love baseball, after the kneeling stunt pulled yesterday, I think I’m done with it. These entitled, elitists think their opinion matters to me? Nope. Well, it matters that I was sickened by the pandering. Anyway, if you happened to miss Dr. Anthony Fauci throwing out the first pitch for the Washington Nationals Opening Day game against the New York Yankees, you didn’t miss much. In fact, if you weren’t looking at the whole field, you may not have seen it at all, because not only did it come up short, it was wildly inaccurate. A lot like Fauci himself. Breitbart News reported: Fauci’s first pitch did not go to home plate. Let’s say it was juuuuust a bit outside.

Well, while the running ability may be there, the throwing ability is definitely not. Fauci is an avid Nationals fan and was very excited about the prospect of throwing out the first pitch. Maybe he was too excited? If there’s any consolation, there are no fans at Nationals Park for tonight’s game due to the coronavirus. So, no one was there to laugh at him. Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found Fauci’s first pitch was about as accurate as he’s been on the pandemic.

Polls Garbage: Trump Virtual Fundraiser Rakes In $20 Million As Biden Struggles To Get 20 Viewers,23 JUL 2020,2728,"On Tuesday, President Trump held a virtual fundraiser and the results were stunning. His reelection campaign raked in a massive $20 million from 300,000 donors. Meanwhile, Joe Biden had trouble getting 20 viewers at one point for his live podcast. The logical deduction here is that the polls are garbage and the media is desperate to deceive the American people into thinking Biden has more supporters than he actually does. Fox News reported: The eye-popping haul is nearly double the $11 million raised last month by Democratic challenger Joe Biden at a fundraiser co-hosted by his one-time boss, former President Obama. Fox News confirmed that Biden and Obama will team up again next Tuesday for a second fundraiser. While the presumptive Democratic nominee has eschewed in-person fundraisers since the coronavirus pandemic swept the nation in March, the president has continued to hold such gatherings. The Trump campaign says the president brought in $10 million at a private in-person fundraiser held earlier this month in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., and an equal amount at a fundraiser last month in Dallas, Texas. He raised roughly $3 million at an in-person fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., last month. Tuesday’s virtual fundraiser, which was co-hosted by Trump Victory Finance Committee national chair Kimberly Guilfoyle, came as the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) edged the president’s campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) in fundraising the past two months. Biden and the DNC have also taken a big bite out of the once vast cash on hand advantage enjoyed by Trump and the RNC. With three and a half months to go until November’s general election, Tuesday’s fundraiser will help fatten the president’s already rich campaign coffers. The Trump campaign told Fox News that they plan “to repeat the innovative and inclusive format.” But that doesn’t mean top-dollar in-person fundraisers will be going away. A leading Republican donor and bundler who helps raise money for the Trump campaign told Fox News that there will be a “fuller pivot to in-person large fundraisers.” The president’s first stab at holding online fundraisers came just days after he held his first online rallies. Trump phoned into supporters in Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan and North Carolina in separate events that were streamed on the campaign’s Facebook page. Biden is picking up steam. His live stream viewers increased today from 16 to 19. — Mike Yoder (@Yoder_Esqq) July 23, 2020 President Trump raised 20 million dollars on a virtual event this week. At one point, Joe Biden couldn't even get 20 people to attend his virtual event today. — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) July 22, 2020"
Michigan Gov. Cuts Hundreds Of Millions from Police And Correctional Dept.,23 JUL 2020,2541,"Rather than waiting on the consent of the citizens of her state, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order yesterday that cuts hundreds of millions of dollars from the state’s police force and correctional departments. Breitbart News reported: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued Executive Order 2020-155 on Wednesday, which cut $115.07 million from the Michigan State Police budget. Talk radio host Steve Gruber reported Whitmer ordered the cut, along with others, including $392.67 million being slashed from the Department of Corrections and $36.46 million from the Department of Health and Human Services. The cut to the State Police equals roughly one-quarter of the agency’s funding, according to Gruber. The cuts were made as Republican legislative leaders and the governor negotiate how to close a $2.2 billion budget deficit, according to the Detroit Free Press. Whitmer is replacing a portion of the cut funds — $107 million — with funds from the federal coronavirus stimulus bill. The real hurt will likely be felt in 2021, when the MSP cuts remain and the additional federal funds are not available to fill the gap. Unlike the federal government, Michigan is required to maintain a balanced budget, so Whitmer and legislative Republicans would need to maintain the massive cut, or some portion of it, or raise taxes. In June, Whitmer said she understood the sentiment behind the “Defund the Police” effort. “What is your response to the defunding the police campaigns?” reporter Terrell Jermaine Starr asked Whitmer. “The spirit is really about reprioritizing, rebuilding communities,” she said, “not just policing.” The governor lamented budgets being “overwhelmingly focused on policing and corrections systems and the criminal justice system.” Whitmer said it should be focused on “the education of our population,” and a myriad of social programs. “So do you support the defunding?” Starr pressed, which he described as “taking money from police departments.” “I think you do all those other things, you don’t need all the money that’s going into police departments,” Whitmer said. “So, yeah, I mean, the spirit of it, I do support that spirit of it,” she said. Later that day, she told the Detroit Free Press, “Perhaps the words that I used on ‘The Root’ were maybe a little confusing, but they have never been other than I support rebuilding communities and rebuilding them in a way that creates real opportunity in an equitable and just manner.” “I don’t believe police should be defunded,” she added."
Biden Tells Muslims He Wishes Schools Taught More “Islamic Faith”,21 JUL 2020,2045,"Not content with the militant arm of the democrat party using fascist intimidation and violence to push momentum into his campaign, the barely cognizant Joe Biden appealed to Muslim voters on Monday, telling them that he “wished” the public schools system taught more about the “Islamic faith.” Fox News reported: Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden spoke to a summit of Muslim voters Monday, telling them he wished U.S. schools taught more about Islam. “I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith. I wish we talked about all the great confessional faiths. It’s one of the great confessional faiths,” Biden said Monday at the “Million Muslim Votes” summit hosted by Emgage Action. Emgage Action, the country’s largest Muslim American PAC, endorsed Biden in April after endorsing Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. Biden told the voters he would end President Trump’s travel ban affecting Muslim-majority countries on day one of his presidency and blamed the White House’s current occupant for “an unconscionable rise in Islamophobia.” Biden also said he “won’t write love letters to dictators,” and would work to “meet the moral demands of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, Yemen, and Gaza.” He said he would champion the rights of Palestinians and Israelis to have a state of their own, among other priorities. A number of Muslim American officials, including Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., signed a letter organized by Emgage Action endorsing Biden on Monday. “Our number one goal is to remove Donald Trump from office and to replace him with someone who can begin to heal our nation,” the letter said. “A Biden administration will move the nation forward on many of the issues we care about,” it said, citing racial justice, affordable healthcare, climate change and immigration. Funny, many people point out that Biden had 8 years in office as VP to “heal” the nation… and his history of bigoted remarks don’t really make that claim ring true."
Kentucky Family Forced “House Arrest” With Ankle Monitors After County Claims “Quarantine” Refusal,21 JUL 2020,2631,"Looking back, it’s probable that one Kentucky woman wishes that she had never been tested for coronavirus. Although she has no symptoms (and studies have argued that asymptomatic cases are not contagious), she wanted to protect her family she was planning to visit. However, when she got the test back and it was positive… her and her husband, and their daughter… lost all of their individual liberty. They have been placed on house arrest and forced to wear ankle monitors like common criminals. Fox News 5 NY reported: A Kentucky couple was fitted with ankle monitors and placed on house arrest after the wife tested positive for coronavirus but refused to sign self-quarantine documents, according to reports. Elizabeth Linscott said she got tested for COVID-19 as a precaution because she was planning to visit her parents in Michigan. She received a positive test result but showed no symptoms. She said the Hardin County Health Department asked her to sign documents agreeing to call them any time she left her house. The young mother claims she never refused to self-quarantine but said she would not sign the documents because of how they were worded, WAVE reported. “My part was if I have to go to the ER, if I have to go to the hospital, I’m not going to wait to get the approval to go,” Linscott told the station. After opting not to sign the health department papers, Linscott said she received a text message informing her that the situation would be escalated and law enforcement would be involved, KABC-TV reported. Her husband, Isaiah, said he was greeted by officers at their front door later that week. “I open up the door, and there’s like eight different people, five different cars, and I’m like ‘what the heck’s going on?’ This guy’s in a suit with a mask. It’s the health department guy, and they have three papers for us. For me, her and my daughter,” Isaiah Linscott said. “We didn’t rob a store. We didn’t steal something. We didn’t hit and run. We didn’t do anything wrong,” Elizabeth Linscott added. The couple said they were fitted with ankle monitors that go off if they stray more than 200 feet from their home. Elizabeth Linscott said that although she never refused to self-quarantine, “that’s exactly what the director of the public health department told the judge.” “I’m like, ‘that’s not the case at all. I never said that,” she said. If she did need to go to the hospital, Linscott said she planned to take necessary precautions like informing healthcare workers that she recently tested positive.  The couple now plans to hire an attorney. Bottom line here: take the test, lose your freedoms."
TN Primary Heats Up: Name Calling And Attack Ads Just The Beginning,21 JUL 2020,6145,"Last week, I got a call from a stranger asking me what I knew about Dr. Manny Sethi, one of the candidates running for the vacant seat in the Senate. The seat was previously held by career politician and notorious gang of eight RINO Lamar Alexander. And, yesterday, I got a spam text telling me that Manny Sethi couldn’t be trusted by Trump conservatives. So, the race is definitely heating up. I explained to the caller last week that I don’t have television, but that my husband and I were starting to research the candidates for the primary coming up in about two weeks. In fact, although I’m not being brainwashed by the boob-tube… like many Tennesseans, I’m extremely informed not only about the present, but also about American history and the pivotal role this state has played throughout the nation’s past. For example (I’ll make it brief) Tennessee statesmen crafted the method still used today for a state’s inclusion in the union; We’ve sent three presidents to the White House; a republican from Tennessee cast the deciding vote for women’s suffrage; oh yeah, and thanks to Tennessee, Al Gore didn’t get elected president in 2000… by not carrying his home state, the race in Florida with the “hanging chads” wouldn’t have mattered. Side Rant: Incidentally, if you do want to relocate to a land that is beautiful, has four real seasons and is still relatively free, where you can raise your children with the convictions of morality in peace (I’m talking about everywhere but Memphis and Nashville), come on down! You’re welcome! However, if you move here thinking to bring your dipshit-liberal, ass hat ideas here and ‘educate’ us ignorant hillbillies… just take yourself off to some other hell hole like the one you’re trying to escape and spread your ‘enlightenment’ there. So, after explaining these things to the caller, who I learned was a recent ‘transplant’ to our fine state… he started talking about Dr. Manny. Everything I heard sounded good. Mask mandates, wrong and stupid. Socialized state healthcare, idiotic. Electoral college, crucial for the existence of the Republic. Recently, Tennesseans have been betrayed by our Senate picks. I’m not talking about Marsha Blackburn, she’s doing okay. I’m talking about Bob ‘turncoat’ Corker and Lamar ‘career politician’ Alexander (he betrayed the state repeatedly over the last four years). And of course, there’s also Bill Lee who has stabbed us all in the back with his leftist leanings. Dr. Manny is an outsider… Bill Hagerty was hand-picked by the establishment to replace Alexander. And, apparently that fact has Hagarty running scared. The Tennessee Star reported: U.S. Senate candidate Manny Sethi released a statewide ad Thursday criticizing his opponent in the Republican primary, Bill Hagerty, for past connections to Mitt Romney and Al Gore. This, according to a press release that Sethi’s campaign emailed Thursday. Sethi’s campaign titled the ad “Romney, Gore, and Common Core.” In the press release, Sethi Campaign Chair Chris Devaney said the ad highlights important differences between the two candidates. “Bill Hagerty is attacking Dr. Manny Sethi for giving $50 to a family friend,” Devaney said. “Meanwhile Hagerty gave $100,000 to Mitt Romney, donated to Al Gore, and Hagerty’s company made millions off Common Core. Hagerty is desperate and scared. He should be—Manny Sethi is winning.” Sethi, in the ad, asks “why is the establishment attacking a nice guy like me?” Hagerty campaign spokeswoman Abigail Sigler addressed the ad in an email Thursday. The Tennessee Star specifically asked Sigler about Sethi’s claim that Hagerty made millions of dollars off Common Core and whether it was true. “Of course, Bill worked to defeat Barack Obama in 2012, unlike Massachusetts Manny Sethi who applied to be in the Obama Biden White House. Manny Sethi’s Never Trumpers have been attacking Bill since the day President Trump endorsed and announced his run for Senate,” Sigler said. [Yet, Hagerty worked with the Clinton administration. And, the ‘application’ she’s talking about was not a partisan appointment.] “President Trump looked at all the candidates in this race, and he endorsed Bill because he trusts Bill to stand with him to protect conservative values, get our economy going again, hold China accountable, and stand up for life.” In 2009 members of the Obama White House announced on their website that Sethi was one of many national finalists for the 2009-2010 class of White House fellows. Sethi Campaign Manager Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer emailed The Star Thursday and offered the following statement: “Hagerty was appointed to the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships by Bill Clinton and re-appointed by Obama. Manny applied for a non-partisan academic fellowship from the Commission, while Hagerty was still on the Commission. Now, Hagerty is attacking Manny for applying to be a part of a group of which Hagerty was a member,” Barnwell-Hagemeyer said adding “it’s all a smokescreen.” As The Star reported this month, Hagerty donated $1,000 each to the presidential campaigns of both Al Gore and George W. Bush in the year 2000, according to Federal Election Commission filings. That year Hagerty, according to his LinkedIn page, worked at the private equity investment firm Hagerty Peterson & Company LLC in Nashville, a position he held until July 2017. Hagerty said on his LinkedIn page that he co-founded the company. So, we see the mud-slinging has begun. Personally, I’m leaning toward Dr. Manny. He’s a first generation American and the momentum behind his campaign is growing… where it counts. Among voters like me who are sprinkled throughout the state and who have a vested interest in keeping Tennessee a beacon of beauty and liberty. The real indicator is where the money is coming from… who’s donating to whose campaign. Hagerty is getting lots of cash from the establishment and is working with Trump’s endorsement. But, the bottom line is… the Senate position MUST be secured by a real conservative. If we aren’t together in this… liberals will tear the house down and destroy the peace we are clinging to by a thread."
Science Proves Respirators And Masks Do Not Prevent Transmission Of Respiratory Virus,17 JUL 2020,14430,"As liberal democrats push ‘science,’ claiming that the country must be shut down again, schools must remain closed, and businesses must be destroyed (to the harm of the American citizen), they seem to only want to push one sort of science… the science they support. Case in point. Experts everywhere around the globe have confirmed that schools reopening is the right thing to do, and that it will not cause a massive spike in COVID infections. But, democrat senators, governors, and mayors are continually pushing “mask mandates.” They claim that we all have to cover our faces in public… and some have speculated it is so that facial recognition software can be refined. But, what does SCIENCE actually say about using masks to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses? It’s actually conclusive… they don’t work. Dr. Denis G Rancourt, PhD, compiled a list of the latest research and published it: Masks and respirators do not work. There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles. Furthermore, the relevant known physics and biology, which I review, are such that masks and respirators should not work. It would be a paradox if masks and respirators worked, given what we know about viral respiratory diseases: The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (< 2.5 μm), which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective-dose is smaller than one aerosol particle. The present paper about masks illustrates the degree to which governments, the mainstream media, and institutional propagandists can decide to operate in a science vacuum, or select only incomplete science that serves their interests. Such recklessness is also certainly the case with the current global lockdown of over 1 billion people, an unprecedented experiment in medical and political history. [The extensive list of research is included] … No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public (more on this below). Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit. Masks and respirators do not work. Precautionary Principle turned on its head with masks In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head (see below). Physics and Biology of Viral Respiratory Disease, and why masks do not work In order to understand why masks cannot possibly work, we must review established knowledge about viral respiratory diseases, the mechanism of seasonal variation of excess deaths from pneumonia and influenza, the aerosol mechanism of infectious disease transmission, the physics and chemistry of aerosols, and the mechanism of the so-called minimum-infective-dose. In addition to pandemics that can occur anytime, in the temperate latitudes there is an extra burden of respiratory-disease mortality that is seasonal, and which is caused by viruses. For example, see the review of influenza by Paules and Subbarao (2017). This has been known for a long time, and the seasonal pattern is exceedingly regular. For example, see Figure 1 of Viboud (2010), which has “Weekly time series of the ratio of deaths from pneumonia and influenza to all deaths, based on the 122 cities surveillance in the US (blue line). The red line represents the expected baseline ratio in the absence of influenza activity,” here: (See article for graphic) The seasonality of the phenomenon was largely not understood until a decade ago. Until recently, it was debated whether the pattern arose primarily because of seasonal change in virulence of the pathogens, or because of seasonal change in susceptibility of the host (such as from dry air causing tissue irritation, or diminished daylight causing vitamin deficiency or hormonal stress). For example, see Dowell (2001). In a landmark study, Shaman et al. (2010) showed that the seasonal pattern of extra respiratory-disease mortality can be explained quantitatively on the sole basis of absolute humidity, and its direct controlling impact on transmission of airborne pathogens. Lowen et al. (2007) demonstrated the phenomenon of humidity-dependent airborne-virus virulence in actual disease transmission between guinea pigs, and discussed potential underlying mechanisms for the measured controlling effect of humidity. The underlying mechanism is that the pathogen-laden aerosol particles or droplets are neutralized within a half-life that monotonically and significantly decreases with increasing ambient humidity. This is based on the seminal work of Harper (1961). Harper experimentally showed that viral-pathogen-carrying droplets were inactivated within shorter and shorter times, as ambient humidity was increased. Harper argued that the viruses themselves were made inoperative by the humidity (“viable decay”), however, he admitted that the effect could be from humidity-enhanced physical removal or sedimentation of the droplets (“physical loss”): “Aerosol viabilities reported in this paper are based on the ratio of virus titre to radioactive count in suspension and cloud samples, and can be criticized on the ground that test and tracer materials were not physically identical.” The latter (“physical loss”) seems more plausible to me, since humidity would have a universal physical effect of causing particle / droplet growth and sedimentation, and all tested viral pathogens have essentially the same humidity-driven “decay”. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand how a virion (of all virus types) in a droplet would be molecularly or structurally attacked or damaged by an increase in ambient humidity. A “virion” is the complete, infective form of a virus outside a host cell, with a core of RNA or DNA and a capsid. The actual mechanism of such humidity-driven intra-droplet “viable decay” of a virion has not been explained or studied. In any case, the explanation and model of Shaman et al. (2010) is not dependant on the particular mechanism of the humidity-driven decay of virions in aerosol / droplets. Shaman’s quantitatively demonstrated model of seasonal regional viral epidemiology is valid for either mechanism (or combination of mechanisms), whether “viable decay” or “physical loss”. The breakthrough achieved by Shaman et al. is not merely some academic point. Rather, it has profound health-policy implications, which have been entirely ignored or overlooked in the current coronavirus pandemic. In particular, Shaman’s work necessarily implies that, rather than being a fixed number (dependent solely on the spatial-temporal structure of social interactions in a completely susceptible population, and on the viral strain), the epidemic’s basic reproduction number (R0) is highly or predominantly dependent on ambient absolute humidity. For a definition of R0, see HealthKnowlege-UK (2020): R0 is “the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is susceptible.” The average R0 for influenza is said to be 1.28 (1.19-1.37); see the comprehensive review by Biggerstaff et al. (2014). In fact, Shaman et al. showed that R0 must be understood to seasonally vary between humid-summer values of just larger than “1” and dry-winter values typically as large as “4” (for example, see their Table 2). In other words, the seasonal infectious viral respiratory diseases that plague temperate latitudes every year go from being intrinsically mildly contagious to virulently contagious, due simply to the bio-physical mode of transmission controlled by atmospheric humidity, irrespective of any other consideration. Therefore, all the epidemiological mathematical modelling of the benefits of mediating policies (such as social distancing), which assumes humidity-independent R0 values, has a large likelihood of being of little value, on this basis alone. For studies about modelling and regarding mediation effects on the effective reproduction number, see Coburn (2009) and Tracht (2010). To put it simply, the “second wave” of an epidemic is not a consequence of human sin regarding mask wearing and hand shaking. Rather, the “second wave” is an inescapable consequence of an air-dryness-driven many-fold increase in disease contagiousness, in a population that has not yet attained immunity. If my view of the mechanism is correct (i.e., “physical loss”), then Shaman’s work further necessarily implies that the dryness-driven high transmissibility (large R0) arises from small aerosol particles fluidly suspended in the air; as opposed to large droplets that are quickly gravitationally removed from the air. Such small aerosol particles fluidly suspended in air, of biological origin, are of every variety and are everywhere, including down to virion-sizes (Despres, 2012). It is not entirely unlikely that viruses can thereby be physically transported over inter-continental distances (e.g., Hammond, 1989). More to the point, indoor airborne virus concentrations have been shown to exist (in day-care facilities, health centres, and onboard airplanes) primarily as aerosol particles of diameters smaller than 2.5 μm, such as in the work of Yang et al. (2011): “Half of the 16 samples were positive, and their total virus concentrations ranged from 5800 to 37 000 genome copies m−3. On average, 64 per cent of the viral genome copies were associated with fine particles smaller than 2.5 µm, which can remain suspended for hours. Modelling of virus concentrations indoors suggested a source strength of 1.6 ± 1.2 × 105 genome copies m−3 air h−1 and a deposition flux onto surfaces of 13 ± 7 genome copies m−2 h−1 by Brownian motion. Over 1 hour, the inhalation dose was estimated to be 30 ± 18 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), adequate to induce infection. These results provide quantitative support for the idea that the aerosol route could be an important mode of influenza transmission.” Such small particles (< 2.5 μm) are part of air fluidity, are not subject to gravitational sedimentation, and would not be stopped by long-range inertial impact. This means that the slightest (even momentary) facial misfit of a mask or respirator renders the design filtration norm of the mask or respirator entirely irrelevant. In any case, the filtration material itself of N95 (average pore size ~0.3−0.5 μm) does not block virion penetration, not to mention surgical masks. For example, see Balazy et al. (2006). Mask stoppage efficiency and host inhalation are only half of the equation, however, because the minimal infective dose (MID) must also be considered. For example, if a large number of pathogen-laden particles must be delivered to the lung within a certain time for the illness to take hold, then partial blocking by any mask or cloth can be enough to make a significant difference. On the other hand, if the MID is amply surpassed by the virions carried in a single aerosol particle able to evade mask-capture, then the mask is of no practical utility, which is the case. Yezli and Otter (2011), in their review of the MID, point out relevant features: For further background: All of this to say that: if anything gets through (and it always does, irrespective of the mask), then you are going to be infected. Masks cannot possibly work. It is not surprising, therefore, that no bias-free study has ever found a benefit from wearing a mask or respirator in this application. Therefore, the studies that show partial stopping power of masks, or that show that masks can capture many large droplets produced by a sneezing or coughing mask-wearer, in light of the above-described features of the problem, are irrelevant. For example, see such studies as these: Leung (2020), Davies (2013), Lai (2012), and Sande (2008). Why there can never be an empirical test of a nationwide mask-wearing policy As mentioned above, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public. There is good reason for this. It would be impossible to obtain unambiguous and bias-free results: Unknown aspects of mask-wearing Many potential harms may arise from broad public policies to wear masks, and the following unanswered questions arise: Conclusion By making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle. In an absence of knowledge, governments should not make policies that have a hypothetical potential to cause harm. The government has an onus barrier before it instigates a broad social-engineering intervention, or allows corporations to exploit fear-based sentiments. Furthermore, individuals should know that there is no known benefit arising from wearing a mask in a viral respiratory illness epidemic, and that scientific studies have shown that any benefit must be residually small, compared to other and determinative factors. Otherwise, what is the point of publicly-funded science? The present paper about masks illustrates the degree to which governments, the mainstream media, and institutional propagandists can decide to operate in a science vacuum, or select only incomplete science that serves their interests. Such recklessness is also certainly the case with the current global lockdown of over 1 billion people, an unprecedented experiment in medical and political history."
Teen’s Parents Sue CA Juvenile Hall Dr. After Forced “Estrogen” Treatment Develops Breasts,17 JUL 2020,1783,"Parents of a California teen are suing after their son was prescribed “estrogen” treatment without their knowledge or consent, and then developed enlarged breasts within 13 days. The New York Post reported: A California teen who says he developed enlarged breasts from taking prescribed estrogen while locked up in a juvenile facility is reportedly suing the doctor who gave him the pills. The teen was given the hormones, which help develop the female reproductive system, after being diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, or ODD, two days into his June 2019 stint at Eastlake Juvenile Hall, the Los Angeles Times reported. Thirteen days after taking one pill a day as prescribed, the teen’s breasts began to enlarge and swell. He developed gynecomastia, a condition suffered by men with high estrogen levels, according to medical records. The county health department doctor who diagnosed the teen and prescribed him estrogen, Danny Wang, did so without the consent or knowledge of his parents, the suit says. The treatment is described in the suit as “experimental” and health professionals told The Times that the hormone is not meant to help with ODD. ODD is described as a disorder suffered by children and teenagers who are routinely averse to discipline and flout demands of parents and authority figures. “Estrogen is not a treatment for ODD,” James McGough, a professor of clinical psychiatry at UCLA, told the newspaper. “I can’t be more emphatic about that. You won’t find a reference anywhere that supports the use of estrogen for ODD.” The teen stopped taking the pills in July 2019 when he complained about the side effects. He was released from the lockup in April and will need surgery to reverse the pill’s effects, his lawyer, Wesley Ouchi, told The Times."
"Georgia Gov. Steps Up For Liberty, Forbids State Officials From Mask Mandates, Sues Mayor",17 JUL 2020,6206,"In the leftist push to force everyone in the United States into wearing masks, closing down the economy, rigging the election and destroying the livelihoods of millions of Americans, one governor is actually standing up for personal liberty. Brian Kemp has acted for Georgia by forbidding local officials from imposing mask mandates and other erroneous restrictions of free citizens based on claims about a virus that has a fatality rate that is less than the flu. In fact, Kemp has sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms for her overreaching and arbitrary decrees. And, he has science on his side because respirators and masks have been shown completely and utterly ineffective for preventing the spread of viral respiratory diseases. Just the News reported:     Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has filed a lawsuit against Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and members of the city council for imposing a mask mandate and other pandemic restrictions. In addition to challenging a mask requirement, the suit pushes back against the Atlanta Mayor’s move to backtrack to “phase one” guidelines, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. According to the Associated Press, some of the requests in the governor’s suit are that the judge overturn any of the mayor’s orders that impose stiffer restrictions than the governor has instituted and that the judge prohibit the mayor from putting out any new orders with stiffer restrictions than those of the governor. “Governor Kemp must be allowed, as the chief executive of this state, to manage the public health emergency without Mayor Bottoms issuing void and unenforceable orders which only serve to confuse the public,” the lawsuit states according to the AP. “This lawsuit is on behalf of the Atlanta business owners and their hardworking employees who are struggling to survive during these difficult times,” Gov. Kemp said in a Twitter statement. “These men and women are doing their very best to put food on the table for their families while local elected officials shutter businesses and undermine economic growth.” Mayor Bottoms spoke out about the governor’s move. “3104 Georgians have died and I and my family are amongst the 106k who have tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, I have been sued by @GovKemp for a mask mandate. A better use of tax payer money would be to expand testing and contact tracing,” she tweeted. “Reading is fundamental. @GovKemp is suing Atlanta over RECOMMENDED guidelines,” the mayor also tweeted. Perhaps the Mayor would actually read some facts herself? There is NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE showing that masks do anything to stop the spread of this Chinese virus. Breitbart News reported: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) effectively stripped local governments across the state from enforcing mask mandates via executive action on Wednesday, drawing ire from mayors across the state, one of whom accused Kemp of trying to “politicize” residents’ health. While several localities across Georgia have implemented mask mandates — from Atlanta to Augusta to Savannah — Kemp moved to prevent local officials from enforcing the orders. However, he is “strongly” encouraging Georgians to wear masks in public. “Kemp’s new order also bans local governments from requiring masks on public property, which void requirements that some governments have imposed for citizens to wear masks inside city and county buildings,” according to the Associated Press. “It is officially official. Governor Kemp does not give a damn about us. Every man and woman for himself/herself. Ignore the science and survive the best you can,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson (D) said in response. “In #Savannah, we will continue to keep the faith and follow the science. Masks will continue to be available!” he exclaimed. It is officially official. Governor Kemp does not give a damn about us. Every man and woman for himself/herself. Ignore the science and survive the best you can. In #Savannah, we will continue to keep the faith and follow the science. Masks will continue to be available! — Mayor Van Johnson (@MayorJohnsonSAV) July 16, 2020 A mask mandate has been in effect in Savannah since July 1, with the possibility of a $500 fine for violating the order. Dunwoody Mayor Lynn Deutsch (D), whose city was slated to implement a mask mandate this week, also took issue with Kemp’s order, apologizing to residents on behalf of the governor, who she said is trying to “politicize” their health. The very people we depend on to show up everyday to keep our essential businesses running, food on our family’s tables, and small businesses operating. No local ordinance was passed casually and without serious deliberation. Our number one priority is public safety. — Lynn Deutsch (@lynndeutsch) July 16, 2020 Multiple hospitals are on diversion, struggling with an increase in the number of patients and a workforce that is being exposed to Covid through community spread. Other states have mandated masks (Alabama! Mississippi!) — Lynn Deutsch (@lynndeutsch) July 16, 2020 Incredibly sad for my community and Georgia tonight. Sorry that the Governor has chosen to politicize your health. #gapol #georgia — Lynn Deutsch (@lynndeutsch) July 16, 2020 “We have to work together in stopping the spread of the coronavirus in @CityofAugusta,” Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis, Jr. (D) said the same day as Kemp’s order. “Wear A Mask,” he continued. We have to work together in stopping the spread of the coronavirus in @CityofAugusta

Watch Your Distance – 6ft pic.twitter.com/47q2sVlRwi — Hardie Davis, Jr. (@hardiedavis) July 15, 2020 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) recently accused President Donald Trump of breaking the law after he did not wear a mask at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport — an apparent violation that, under Bottoms’ order, could result in a fine or jail time. “So by not having on a mask, President Trump did violate law in the city of Atlanta, but I am somehow not surprised that he disregarded our rules and regulations in the city,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Many people point out that Bottoms cares nothing for the law when she allows roving gangs of thugs to kill children in her city."
"San Francisco’s ‘Hotel’ Plan for Homeless Is “Pandemonium,” Filth, Assaults, And Deaths",17 JUL 2020,2216,"As is expected with almost every single democrat policy plan to address any sort of issue… the San Francisco plan to help the homeless survive the COVID ‘crisis’ by putting them in hotel rooms has failed miserably. In fact, it hasn’t just failed… it’s created scores of new problems, with drugs, filth, assaults, and deaths piling up in Pelosi’s district. The ‘crisis workers’ assigned to visit the rooms are sickened and appalled. Many people hope that it will be a wake up call to these ‘woke’ voters. Fox News reported: Thousands of homeless people have been housed in San Francisco’s empty hotels in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. However, City Journal contributor Erica Sandberg told “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Wednesday the policy has been an “absolute disaster,” “It’s solving exactly nothing and as a matter of fact, it’s making all the problems worse,” said Sandberg, who described the scene inside the hotels as “about as bad as you can imagine, only exponentially worse.” “You are talking drug-fueled parties, overdoses, deaths, people are being assaulted. You have sexual assaults going on, it is pandemonium,” she said. “It is extremely bad and it needs to stop.” City officials reportedly secured close to 5,000 rooms at several city hotels that signed up to house homeless and other members of at-risk populations who need to quarantine. Controversy ensued after a report alleged that the city was providing alcohol, marijuana, and methadone to homeless addicts residing in the hotels. “The people who are assigned as disaster workers, these people have been librarians,” Sandberg told host Brian Kilmeade. “They are just paper pushers, administrators who are reassigned to these hotels and what they are telling me is beyond the pale. “They are not just horrified, they are traumatized by what they see. You have mattresses that have feces on them, blood, hospital bands on the floor. What people are seeing is so horrible that they walk out and they say, ‘I don’t want to go back in there.'” Meanwhile, Sandberg said, city officials are “trying to put this kind of a Band-Aid on it and pretend it’s not happening. “Oh, it’s happening,” she added, “and it’s worse than people imagine.”"
Biden’s New Plan: “Get Our Kids To Market Swiftly”,16 JUL 2020,1619,"Joe Biden is the king of “gaffes,’ but recently, his “mental moments” seem to occur in every carefully scripted appearance. His latest plan: “get our kids to market swiftly.” Sara Carter ripped into this faux pas: Former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a new bold plan on Tuesday to ‘get our kids to market swiftly.’ Of course, it was another one of his famous gaffes but at first I thought it was part of his efforts to cut back on gas emissions. Seriously, however, his continued gaffes are raising concern about his health and whether or not he’ll be able to debate President Donald Trump.

Other Biden gaffes have been the brunt of jokes on social media. In one major gaffe he described his 1962 encounter with a gang member who went by the name of ‘Corn Pop.’ In the same video, he rambled on about his blonde hair on his legs and how children liked to touch his glistening hair.

Christian University Sues NY Times For $10 Million Over “Made Up” COVID Story,16 JUL 2020,6516,"Liberty University in Virginia is suing the New York Times for a false, “made up” story about their campus and COVID. The $10 million defamation suit involves fake reporting that students who came back to school after spring break became infected because the school refused to close. Many people argue that this sort of legal pressure must continue, given the NYT’s penchant for publishing outright lies. The Washington Examiner reported: In a 100-page suit, with exhibits, filed in Virginia’s Lynchburg Circuit Court, the 49-year-old school also charged that New York Times reporter Elizabeth Williamson and photographer Julia Rendleman ignored “No Trespassing” signs to tour the campus at a time when the school was trying to keep outsiders, who could potentially be infected with COVID-19, away. The long-threatened suit stems from a March 29 viral story that suggested several students were infected after returning from spring break. In fact, no student, staffer, or faculty member on campus was, or became, infected. JUST POSTED: “We need help to go home.” I visited Liberty U. as the consequences of Jerry Falwell’s decision to reopen the campus amid a pandemic came home to roost. https://t.co/sglQgqzqo8 — Elizabeth Williamson (@NYTLiz) March 29, 2020 The story was never retracted despite pleas from Liberty. “None of this was true. There was never an on-campus student diagnosed with COVID-19. The only actual ‘viral’ element of this narrative that existed was the intense ‘viral’ internet attention it generated for the New York Times’ website and for those paying to advertise on that website,” said the suit, provided in advance to Secrets. “Attacked for keeping Liberty University open, he now seems to have made a good call.” https://t.co/muEBJ9KhC8 — Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) May 18, 2020 In a statement Wednesday evening, Eileen Murphy, the Times’ senior vice president of corporate communications, shrugged off the suit. She told Secrets, “We are confident that our story accurately portrayed the reopening of Liberty University and the public health concerns that the reopening raised. We look forward to defending our work in court. ” The suit said that Liberty, which was started by the late Jerry Falwell and is now run by his son Jerry Falwell Jr., has been a frequent target of the media, especially the New York Times, because it is “clickbait” for liberal readers. But, Falwell told Secrets today, “they picked on the wrong conservative.” It is the second embarrassment for the New York Times in two days. On Tuesday, prominent opinion writer Bari Weiss quit and ripped the paper in a public letter saying that the paper’s coverage is driven by “clicks” and Twitter. “It’s just not right for the mainstream media to lie about and target conservative Christian organizations just because of their faith and because of their political beliefs, and we’re going to make an example out of them,” said Falwell. Another illustration of why the lying @nytimes and other mainstream #FakeNews publications are failing financially and have lost the public’s trust. ZERO COVID cases on campus @LibertyU and the campus just closed for the semester @NYTLiz ! https://t.co/bY8oXqKsl4 — Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) May 7, 2020 Falwell’s action is the second against the New York Times for its story on the university. In April, he pushed for warrants against the reporter and photographer for trespassing. That case was dropped, though the photographer wrote in the New York Times, “I do, however, need Jerry Falwell Jr.’s permission to ever return to Liberty University.” The suit spelled out several errors and problems with the original story that carried two different headlines, “Liberty Brings Back Its Students, and Coronavirus, Too” and “A University Reopened, and Students Got Sick.” The subhead said, “The decision by the school’s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., to partly reopen his evangelical university enraged residents of Lynchburg, Va. Then students started getting sick.” For example, it said that the school reopened after spring break. What it did was let back some 1,500 of 15,000 students who were foreign or didn’t want to return home. Virus protections were put in place, including social distancing. Several other colleges and universities did the same thing. The story also quoted an off-campus physician, Dr. Thomas Eppes, who said several students suffered some flu-like illness, but it turned out not to be the coronavirus. He said his words were twisted and Liberty’s offer to interview the school doctor were ignored. The state health department also conducted two surprise inspections and found everything in order and in compliance with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s rules. “All operations appeared to be in compliance with the governor’s emergency order,” said Jim Bowles, a state health manager, before critical stories in the New York Times and ProPublica appeared. Still, the New York Times wrote, “So Mr. Falwell — a staunch ally of President Trump and an influential voice in the evangelical world — reopened the university last week, igniting a firestorm. As of Friday, Dr. Eppes said, nearly a dozen Liberty students were sick with symptoms that suggested Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Three were referred to local hospital centers for testing. An additional eight were told to self-isolate.” I agree with what Purdue University President Mitch Daniels said about the wisdom of keeping college campuses open where COVID-19 poses close to zero lethal threat to the young people who make up such a high percentage of the campus population. https://t.co/HJt3In8Zgs — Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) June 2, 2020 As it takes efforts to put special protections in place for the upcoming semester, Liberty is eager to exact some revenge on the New York Times. Falwell said the college will donate any money won in a suit decision to groups tackling the coronavirus. In a statement, he said, “They target us because the university is a conservative and Christian institution. While this fulfilled their ‘clickbait’ business model, it also violated the law in many ways. Therefore, we are holding the New York Times accountable for their malicious and false reporting and their violation of the measures we took to protect our students. Politically-motivated attacks by the mainstream news media that defame and libel conservatives and Christians should not be allowed in the United States of America and will not be tolerated by Liberty University.”"
"National Police Organizations (NAPO) Withdraw Biden Support, Endorse Trump Instead",16 JUL 2020,1863,"In a move that stunned many people, yesterday, the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) withdrew their support for democrat candidate Joe Biden, and switched it to President Donald Trump. The move comes as Biden has jumped on the socialist-Marxist bandwagon, vowing to cut police funding and otherwise make America a seething caldron of chaos and lawlessness. “Our endorsement recognizes your steadfast and very public support for our men and woman on the front lines, especially during this time of unfair and inaccurate opprobrium being directed at our members by so many,” the letter from NAPO President Michael McHale stated. Breitbart News reported: NAPO has endorsed President Trump in his reelection campaign. Here is our endorsement letter which was issued following today’s meeting. pic.twitter.com/mf6ZUTf10l — NAPO (@NAPOpolice) July 15, 2020 NAPO previously endorsed the Obama-Biden presidential ticket in both 2008 and 2012 and did not endorse a candidate in 2016. The organization represents more than 1,000 police associations and 241,000 sworn officers. The letter cited the Justice Department under Trump for prosecuting individuals attacking police officers, signing the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, and support for the 9/11 first responders fund as more reasons for their support. The Trump campaign welcomed the news in a statement: “Joe Biden has done nothing to stop his party’s ‘defund the police’ movement and remains silent as police officers across the country are being attacked by violent rioters and protesters,” Trump 2020 Senior Advisor for Law Enforcement and Labor Unions Bob Paduchik said in a statement. “This endorsement for President Trump highlights that as the Law and Order President, he is defending the hardworking people who risk their own lives every day to keep our communities safe.”"
Asheville City Council Approves “Reparations” In Formal “Apology” To Blacks,16 JUL 2020,4681,"In an act that has stunned a number of people, the City of Asheville, North Carolina (democrat controlled), has voted to approve “reparations” for slavery as an ‘apology’ to black people living today. Many people argue that the move is highly offensive, because it basically conveys the message that Black people cannot achieve anything in the United States. Breitbart News reported: North Carolina’s Asheville City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to pass a repentant measure that formally apologizes to black residents and moves to issue reparations in the form of investments in certain areas of the community through the creation of the Community Reparations Commission. The resolution, which passed 7-0, does not include cash payments made directly to black residents but does call on the city to form the Community Reparations Commission, which would hear from community leaders and groups who would, in turn, make recommendations on where funds should be directed. “Hundreds of years of black blood spilled that basically fills the cup we drink from today,” Keith Young, a black member of the council, said. “It is simply not enough to remove statutes. Black people in this country are dealing with issues that are systemic in nature,” he added. The measure, titled “Resolution Supporting Community Reparations for Black Asheville,” cites a host of reasons for the resolution, including “racist practices in the private realty market,” “discriminatory wages,” “inadequate” health care, and policing. The measure states, unequivocally, that “systemic racism was created over centuries and will take time to dismantle” and declares that state and federal governments “have a responsibility to adopt programs, policies, and funding to address reparations.” The resolution has the city council apologizing for “its participation in and sanctioning of the Enslavement of Black People,” as well as for its “enforcement of segregation and its accompanying discriminatory practices.” It calls on “other organizations and institutions” in the city that have “advanced and benefitted from racial inequality” to apologize alongside the city council and work with the city to “address systemic racism.” It also urges the state and federal government to “initiate policymaking and provide funding for reparations at the state and national levels.” As for the local level, the city council “seeks to establish within the next year, a new commission empowered to make short, medium and long term recommendations that will make significant progress toward repairing the damage caused by public and private systemic Racism.” The resolution states in part: Other local government community organizations may also be invited to have representation on the Commission. The task of the Community Reparations Commission is to issue a report in a timely manner for consideration by the City and other participating community groups for incorporation into their respective short and long term priorities and plans. Accountability for achieving equity will be enforced in the appropriate offices. The report and the resulting budgetary and programmatic priorities may include but not be limited to increasing minority homeownership and access to other affordable housing, increasing minority business ownership and career opportunities, strategies to grow equity and generational wealth, closing the gaps in health care, education, employment and pay, neighborhood safety and fairness within criminal justice. The city council’s move comes as federal lawmakers continue in their push to pass Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s (D-TX) Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act, or H.R. 40. The legislation is included in the “Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force” proposal, which states: Democrats commit to the important first step of supporting H.R. 40, which would establish a commission to examine how the legacy of 246 years of slavery and another century of Jim Crow segregation continues to impact the economic prospects of Black Americans today, and to recommend remedies. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) have also expressed support for reparations by way of the BREATHE Act, which calls for the establishment of commissions that “design reparations for mass criminalization—including the War on Drugs, the criminalization of prostitution, and police violence; border violence; and the systemic violation of the U.S. Government’s treaty obligations to Tribal nations.” It looks like Rhode Island is headed that way as well. Rhode Island was once the most lovely little state. https://t.co/on87VI3QVP — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) July 16, 2020"
Florida Lied About COVID Positive Rate: Amounts Inflated By 10 Times,15 JUL 2020,3410,"The media continues to broadcast the ‘increasing’ COVID infection rates, conveniently ignoring the massively lowering fatality rates of the virus, but apparently, those numbers are a lie. In the case of Florida, that’s certain. A hospital in the sunshine state confirmed that the near 100 percent positivity rates they reported was not true. In fact, the numbers have been inflated by 10. Ten times! So, if 10 people tested positive, 100 were reported… if 100 people tested positive for the virus that is NOT as deadly as the flu, 1,000 were reported infected. Just the News reported: Florida hospital handling COVID-19 tests confirmed to media this week that its near-100% positivity rate was overstated by a factor of 10, raising already-heightened concerns that numerous labs are over reporting the number of confirmed infections. The Florida Division of Emergency Management posts a daily coronavirus update on its website, which features a list of the positivity rates of every COVID testing facility in the state. Hundreds of labs and hospitals throughout Florida are regularly testing state residents for the coronavirus. In recent days, numerous facilities have begun reporting 100% positivity rates, figures significantly higher than the statewide average of around 15%. Many of those labs claim to have tested only one patient, though others with 100% rates report testing dozens and sometimes hundreds of patients.  Orlando news station Fox 35 said on Monday that it undertook an investigation of those “astronomical figures,” after which several medical facilities confirmed that their actual positive rates were much lower than those reported to the state government. The news station reported that area hospital Orlando Health “confirmed errors in the report,” with hospital officials stating their their “positivity rate is only 9.4 percent, not 98 percent.” Another Orlando-area lab, Veteran’s Medical Center, listed “a positivity rate of 76 percent,” but a company official said that “the positivity rate for the center is actually 6 percent.” The inflated numbers come as Florida has been recording record numbers of COVID-19 infections, though an analysis of state data by Just the News last week revealed that the state’s recent record-breaking counts of infections may have been overestimated by as much as 30%. That is huge! And these false rates are helping to spread the fear-mongering the left needs to orchestrate another shut down, many experts argue. Fox 35 reported: Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. … FOX 35 News went on to speak with the Florida Department of Health on Tuesday. They confirmed that although private and public laboratories are required to report positive and negative results to the state immediately, some have not. Specifically, they said that some smaller, private labs were not reporting negative test result data to the state. “The Department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data,” a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said. “As the state continues to receive results from various labs, the Department will continue educating these labs on proper protocol for reporting COVID-19 test results.” Do not look for the media to report on the decreased numbers."
Chicago Threatens To Bulldoze Churches If COVID Mandates Not Obeyed,14 JUL 2020,4106,"In Chicago, two churches have been threatened by city officials with complete destruction if they fail to obey the arbitrary edits issued by the city concerning COVID restrictions. They said the buildings would be demolished. Although statistics prove that the virus is no more deadly than the flu, and that fatalities have dropped in massive numbers, somehow, the war against Christian Americans, small businesses and freedom is ramping up. Big League Politics reported: The lawyer for two Chicago churches has reported that city officials informed his clients that they would consider bulldozing their facilities if they do not comply with COVID-19 edicts. Matt Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said on Wednesday that the city is classifying his clients as “public nuisances.” He said they were issued a letter declaring that the city “has the power and duty to cause all nuisances affecting the health of the public to be abated.” The letter threatened a “summary abatement,” which would mean the destruction of the facilities without due process. Staver said during an appearance on the “Todd Starnes Radio Show” that he is seeking an emergency injunction and hopes to take the case to the Supreme Court. The motion for the injunction is headed to the desk of SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh right now. Rev. Cristian Ionescu, one of the pastors being represented in this case, also told Starnes that he has received citations from the city for violating COVID-19 policies. Metro Praise International’s Pastor Joe Wyrostek reported receiving the “summary abatement” threatening his facility with destruction if he holds a service with more than 10 people. “We are very disappointed with all of this, including not being considered as essential in the beginning, as a church,” Wyrostek said to NBC Chicago. Even as violent crime spikes, Chicago city officials use limited police forces to snoop on churches and enforce shutdown mandates in Christian places of worship. This is part of a nationwide trend of left-wing government bureaucrats using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to attack Christianity. Big League Politics has reported on authorities cracking down on Christians who refuse to surrender their religious liberty due to mass hysteria: The pastor of a church in Central, Louisiana has returned to the pulpit despite being on house arrest for complications from holding supposedly illegal worship services in contradiction to the governor’s edicts. Rev. Tony Spell got into words with an anti-Christian protester outside of his Life Tabernacle Church a week ago, which resulted in him being given an ankle monitor after a contentious incident on the road. Regardless of the possible consequences, he was back preaching today while showing off his ankle bracelet in defiance of the consequences. Spell told his flock that it is a “dirty rotten shame when you’re hiding in America.” His parishioners stand with him fully, singing songs of joy in Christ while waving signs which state: “I stand with Pastor Spell.” He was released last week and ordered to “refrain from any and all criminal conduct, including but not limited to strictly abiding by the all emergency orders issued by the Governor of the State of Louisiana.” Spell believes that his freedom of religion cannot be abridged by a government edict. “God gave you an immune system to kill the virus,” Spell said while giving his sermon on Sunday morning. “I’m not going to bind the virus.” Law enforcement is far from happy that Spell refuses to kneel beneath them as they attempt to enforce the governor’s unlawful orders. “It will not be up to a judge on whether he’s picked up or not, and what his punishment will be,” Baton Rouge Central Police Chief Roger Corcoran said to TMZ. “It’s a blatant disrespect to the law and to the judge’s order. It’s further proof Tony Spell is out for himself and has no respect for the law,” Corcoran added. In addition to charges of aggravated assault and improper backing, Spell also faces six misdemeanor charges for disobeying the edicts of Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards."
Security Guard Shoots 50-Yr-Old Man In The Back For Not Wearing Mask,14 JUL 2020,1381,"A security guard in California has been arrested for murder after his evilly slaughtered a 50-year-old man, shooting him in the back, allegedly because the man wasn’t wearing a mask. Fox News reported: The incident occurred at the Gardena market in South California on Sunday, when the customer, Jerry Lewis, reportedly entered the store without a mask and got into an argument with the guard, Umeir Hawkins. Masks are mandated in the [communist controlled] state of California, a rule put into effect by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in mid-June as the state saw a resurgence in coronavirus cases amid phased reopenings of businesses. Lewis apparently left the store, returned and continued fighting with Hawkins, who then fatally shot Lewis as he walked away, prosecutors said. Hawkins and his wife Sabrina Carter were each charged with one count of possession of a handgun by a felon, stemming from a prior conviction in 2013 for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, according to a press release by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. Bail for Hawkins was set a $1 million and $35,000 for Carter. Hawkins faces a maximum sentence of 50 years to life in state prison while Carter faces three years in prison.

"Newsom Goes Full Totalitarian: Indoor Activities Banned, Schools Won’t Open In Fall",14 JUL 2020,7133,"Although scientific studies have shown that COVID fatality rates are dropping at an amazing rate and a number of actual “cures” have been discovered for the Chinese virus, Gavin Newsom isn’t allowing those sorts of facts to get in the way of his totalitarian rule of California. Newsom has arbitrarily decided that indoor activities in 30 counties must be stopped… including churches, gyms, and bars…except for his winery, of course. Additionally, both Los Angeles and San Diego have decided that schools will not reopen in the fall, and instead, ‘distance learning’ will be established. Exactly how that will happen is anyone guess. Liquor stores and pot dispensaries are essential–but we're debating schools. We live in a clown world. — thebradfordfile™ (@thebradfordfile) July 14, 2020 As of today, the CDC has recorded that 1,426,483 people have recovered from the coronavirus in America. This is likely much higher considering cases that were never recorded. The media should report this number as much as they report the death rate. — Dr. David Samadi (@drdavidsamadi) July 10, 2020 While COVID-19 behaves completely different than the flu & is far more contagious – the death rate still seems comparatively low. We are making good progress in treating this virus and will continue to. pic.twitter.com/q5OH2GjYwJ — Dr. David Samadi (@drdavidsamadi) July 14, 2020 Breitbart News reported: California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Monday ordered the shut down of bars and indoor dining statewide and directed churches, gyms, and hair salons to close in 30 counties as the state experiences a rise in Chinese coronavirus cases. “We’ve made this point on multiple occasions and that is we’re moving back into a modification mode of our original stay-at-home order,” Newsom said in a press conference. “This continues to be a deadly disease.” [That is an exaggeration, many experts argue.] JUST IN: CA Gov. Gavin Newsom orders California to shut down indoor activities, all bar operations https://t.co/LbCHHnwu2b pic.twitter.com/6X3bV95emk — The Hill (@thehill) July 13, 2020 The order follows the governor directing such businesses to halt operations in counties on the state’s “monitoring list.” 31 counties are on the monitoring list, totaling approximately 80 percent of its population. On Sunday, California reported 8,358 additional coronavirus cases and a 28 percent increase in hospitalizations in the past 14 days. The state has a total of 320,000 cases and over 7,000 fatalities. [So they say. Many people remember that the federal government hands out more money for more cases… and California was on the brink of financial disaster before the ‘crisis.’] Ahead of 4th of July weekend, Newsom directed multiple counties to shut down bars and indoor operations at restaurants and family entertainment businesses, including bowling alleys. The development comes after California’s two largest school districts — Los Angeles and San Diego — announced that students will not return to the classroom when the fall semester begins in August. The districts said in a joint statement Monday they will start the school year with online instruction only, but will plan for in-person learning as health conditions allow. Los Angeles Unified, the nation’s second-largest district with about 730,000 students, begins instruction on Aug. 18. San Diego Unified, which serves approximately 135,000 students, is set to start on Aug. 31. The districts cited research and information about school safety experiences from around the world as well as state and local health guidance. Blithering idiot #GavinNewsom closing churches and restaurants, but he says this was okay… pic.twitter.com/WH3G8L7fMs — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) July 14, 2020 KTLA Reported: “While the new school year will begin in August, it will not start with students at school
facilities,” Beutner said. “The health and safety of all in the school community is not something we can compromise. The news about the spread of the virus continues to be of great concern.” The superintendent said the five-month school closure has been the longest in recent history for the nation’s second-largest public school system, but the risk of widespread transmission is too great, especially since asymptomatic people can spread the virus. “A 10-year-old student might have a 30-year-old teacher, a 50-year-old bus driver or live with a 70-year-old grandmother. All need to be protected,” Beutner said. “There’s a public health imperative to keep schools from becoming a petri dish.” Students will continue their learning online, and schools will add one-on-one tutoring on Saturdays and after school, according to Beutner. The announcement comes after Los Angeles County’s health director Barbara Ferrer told district superintendents to have plans in place to continue distance learning for “100% of the time” as the county’s coronavirus numbers spiked. She said in a news conference last week that campuses wouldn’t be opening their doors to students unless they’re sure they can avoid an “explosion of outbreaks.” [Really? That sounds like a complete closure to most people, paving the way for forced vaccinations… or a ploy for more federal funding in a state that has nearly bankrupted itself with leftist policies.] … Weekly coronavirus testing and contact tracing will help protect students and staff, but that would cost $300 per student and more funding is needed from the federal government, Beutner said. [Bingo.] “The cost of testing all at schools, maybe $15 billion, will help make it safer for all 50 million students and their teachers in public schools across the country,” he said. “But this is about something that can’t be measured in dollars and cents; it’s about creating opportunity for children.” President Donald Trump has been calling for campuses to reopen, and he threatened to hold back federal funds if school districts don’t bring their students back in the fall. Gov. Gavin Newsom last week said the decision on reopening California’s schools will be made by local officials with understanding of the pandemic in their jurisdictions. Just the News reported: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday announced school reopening guidance for his state. We all want schools to open but it has to be safe. In NY we will decide based on the data.Schools will reopen if a region is in Phase 4 & daily infection rate remains below 5% (14-day avg).Schools close if regional infection rate is greater than 9% (7-day avg) after August 1.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) July 13, 2020 New York City last week announced plans to have students return to the classroom, but only on some weekdays. The students would engage in remote learning on the remaining days. A press release said that the plans would be contingent on whether “the city continues to meet all necessary COVID-19 public health thresholds.” Parents who want to have their children exclusively engage in remote learning will have that option, according to the notice. According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 3.35 million coronavirus cases in the U.S., and more than 135,000 deaths."
Must See: Cuban American Warns US Not To Be “Useful Idiots” And Lose Only “Place Left”,13 JUL 2020,3733,"Last week, during a round table with President Trump, Cuban immigrant Maximo Alvarez, president of Sunshine Gasoline, issued an important warning to all citizens. He explained that the same tactics that are unfolding on our streets have been used before… and if we don’t stand up to it, the world will have “no place” left for freedom. The American Dream is at risk of being wiped out and destroyed by leftists. Townhall reported: The tactics that are being used are the same ones he saw in Communist Cuba when he was 11-years-old. “We come over here, in my case because my parents chose that I would not be indoctrinated by the communist country, by the totalitarian country, by the totalitarian regime. They don’t educate children. Absolutely not. And this is something that we need to understand. What is happening in our backyard today, I experienced as an 11-year-old. I remember vividly all the promises that a guy named Castro gave, and how 99 percent of the people swallowed the pill,” he warned. “It took many years later, after I read somebody named Saul Alinsky, that I realized that all those people were nothing but useful idiots. I remember Castro while in the mountains being interviewed and asked if he was a communist. He went crazy. …  He was going to save Cuba. I remember how he promised to the farmers, to the wahitos that you’re going to own the land. I remember all the promises that we hear today about free education and free health care and free land.” Alvarez reminded people that Fidel Castro abolished the police, the military and even took over the Catholic church. The immigrant’s dad, however, saw through Castro’s words because he experienced the same thing under communist Spain. Alvarez’s father saw parallel’s between Castro and his home country. The businessman explained that the left uses fancy terms and promises to try and indoctrinate others. It’s the same tactics he saw in Cuba. “Talking about socialism, Catholic church, 14,000 kids who came like me in this country without parents. And we were provided an opportunity. This is what makes our country great. They didn’t give me free nothing, they gave me the opportunity. That is the most valuable thing in the world,” Alvarez explained. “Now, when I said they didn’t give me any free something, please understand that at 13-years-old, I had to be provided with a home, had to be provided with food, and an education. That is socialism, that’s Americanism, that’s the America that these people are trying to destroy today by using funny terms like ‘socialism.’ They’re not, they’re communists. Don’t ever forget that.” Alvarez’s biggest warning, however, came directly from his father, who saw what life was like in Spain, Cuba and the United States: do whatever you have to to protect the American Dream. “Never forget about my dad who only had a sixth-grade education, but I think he was the greatest philosopher I ever met. He used to tell us how lucky he was because he was able to come from Spain to Cuba. And then he came from Cuba to [the] United States and he saw me graduate from college, and that was the biggest prize he ever had. And he said, ‘Don’t lose this place because you’re never going to be as lucky as me. Because if you lose this place, you have no place to go,'” Alvarez recounted. “So with that, please keep that in mind. And please, people, explain that to our young people who are demonstrating out there. Don’t be useful idiots,” he said. “Please understand what’s happening in our country. See what happens to our parents and see what is happening to America today.” Watch the powerful statement below: EVERYONE needs to watch this.pic.twitter.com/DNzkuFxVWI — thebradfordfile™ (@thebradfordfile) July 11, 2020"
"LA Teachers Union Demands Schools Stay Closed Until Charter Schools Shut Down, Police Defunded",13 JUL 2020,2779,"Teachers in Los Angeles, California have decided that the BLM ‘movement’ (aka the Marxist lies they’ve programmed into children over the past few decades) has now created the impetus they need to demand more money and the elimination of charter school choice. Basically, they say take the money from police and give it to us, and make sure that no child has the opportunity to avoid the careful indoctrination we’ve planned to usher in a socialist inferno. Just the News reported: A major teachers union is claiming that the re-opening of schools in its district cannot occur without several substantial policy provisions in place, including a “moratorium” on charter schools and the defunding of local police. United Teachers Los Angeles, a 35,000-strong union in the Los Angeles Unified School District, made those demands in a policy paper it released this week. The organization called on local authorities to “keep school campuses closed when the semester begins on Aug. 18.” The union outlined numerous major provisions it says will be necessary to reopen schools again, including sequestering students in small groups throughout the school day, providing students with masks and other forms of protective equipment, and re-designing school layouts in order to facilitate “social distancing.” Yet the union goes even farther than those requests, calling for “local support” in the form of defunded police departments and the shuttering of charter schools. Police violence “is a leading cause of death and trauma for Black people, and is a serious public health and moral issue,” the union writes. The document calls on authorities to “shift the astronomical amount of money devoted to policing, to education and other essential needs such as housing and public health.” “Privately operated, publicly funded charter schools,” meanwhile, “drain resources from district schools,” the union states. The practice of “colocating” charter schools in existing structures, it continues, “adds students to campuses when we need to reduce the number of students to allow for physical distancing.” The union also demands the implementation of a federal Medicare-for-All program, several new state-level taxes on wealthy people, and a “federal bailout” of the school district.  “The benefits to restarting physical schools must outweigh the risks, especially for our most vulnerable students and school communities,” the document continues. “As it stands, the only people guaranteed to benefit from the premature physical reopening of schools amidst a rapidly accelerating pandemic are billionaires and the politicians they’ve purchased,” it adds. Actually, many experts argue that the people who will benefit is society in general. Others argue that these ‘demands’ stink of extortion."
Nurses Demand Investigation After Nursing Home Policy ‘Cleared’ Of COVID Deaths,13 JUL 2020,2086,"In New York, an State Department of Health ‘investigation’ into the massive number of COVID deaths reported that it wasn’t due to the policy of putting infected people in nursing homes, where they infected many more elderly… it was because of healthcare workers. Seriously. CBS 6 Albany reported: On July 6th, the State Department of Health released a report that found the spread of coronavirus in New York nursing homes was a result of infected staff members, not a controversial March policy enacted by the governor’s desk. In response to the findings of the report, the New York State Nurses Associations released a statement, which reads in part: “This statement does not reflect the experiences of frontline nurses of the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) who throughout were pointing at critical shortages of personal protective equipment and calling for widespread testing in order to guide New York’s response to the virus since the onset of this pandemic.” The statement continues, recapping NYSNA’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, before calling for an independent investigation of the practices within nursing homes: “New Yorkers deserve a full accounting of what happened over the past four months, and the NYSDOH nursing home report, unfortunately, does not move us forward. The need is plain for a comprehensive, independent review of nursing home practices, the role of for-profit operators, and NYSDOH oversight.” NYSNA joins a growing movement across the state for an independent investigation, and on the state and local level, steps are already being taken in that direction. The New York State Nurses Association represents more than 42,000 members in New York State. Many experts have already used logic to understand that a virus that causes elderly patients to die in higher rates caused the deaths of hundreds, possibly thousands of New Yorkers, thanks to placing infected patients in nursing homes in close proximity with the most vulnerable… in order to increase fatalities so that the democrat controlled state could collect more federal funds."
Judge Approves Petition As “Fire The Mayor” Campaign Gains Speed,13 JUL 2020,5182,"A petition to recall Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan is gaining speed, and now a judge has approved it. The campaign, “Fire The Mayor” has wide support given that Durkan’s actions over the past weeks have been calculated to increase violence, destruction of public and private property, and generally violated her oath to uphold the laws of the state and the city. The Seattle Times ‘reported’: The ruling Friday on charges filed by a group of five people last month comes after weeks of local protests [aka riots, looting, murder] against racism and police brutality… Once any recall petition is approved, signatures are needed to qualify for a special election ballot. The petitioners must, within 180 days, collect valid signatures from a number of voters equal to 25% of the votes cast in the last election. In this case, signatures from more than 50,000 Seattle voters would be needed. The Durkan petitioners’ recall effort, known online as the “Fire the Mayor” campaign, accuses the mayor of “endanger[ing] the peace and safety of the community” by allowing police to “leak false information about fabricated crimes and threats to the media” and issuing a citywide curfew without sufficient notice to the public. The petitioners also accused Durkan of restricting certain property rights in downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill, the neighborhood where many of the protests took place. “Jenny Durkan’s abuses of power, lack of foresight and failure to protect the public — and the peace — in Seattle leaves us with no choice,” petitioner Elliott Harvey wrote in a statement on the campaign’s website. “This is exactly the kind of case a recall is intended to address.” In a response Saturday, Durkan’s chief of staff, Stephanie Formas, said the mayor “consistently has acted to protect the City’s public health and safety and to respect the constitutional rights to peaceful protesters,” and defended Police Chief Carmen Best, who Durkan believes “has exercised her challenging duties lawfully and appropriately to protect the public peace,” according to the statement. [Except, of course, for the people who were viciously beaten and murdered while she allowed the occupation to proceed without hindrance…. And even helped it.] The court this month held an online hearing on the petition, hearing from the petitioners and from attorney Rebecca J. Roe, who represented Durkan. In her ruling Friday, Judge Mary E. Roberts dismissed six of the seven charges put forward as “insufficient,” but allowed one — which accuses Durkan of allowing tear gas and other crowd control weapons to be used during the coronavirus pandemic — to proceed “more narrowly than alleged.” The judge did not rule on whether the allegation was true. “This court’s role in this case is limited,” she wrote. “At this stage of a recall effort, the court is to assume that the Recall Petitioners’ allegations are true, and to determine whether if true, they can support a recall.” Formas, speaking for Durkan, said in a statement that the court’s ruling is significant since, at this stage of the proceedings, the judge must assume the allegations are true. “Even under this low standard, the Court dismissed six of the seven claims” in the petition, and dismissed a second petition altogether, the statement said. “The mayor believes this remaining claim will be dismissed,” Formas said. The mayor could appeal the ruling, but Formas did not say if she would. Roberts also approved a ballot synopsis, which reads: “As alleged by [the petitioners], shall Jenny Durkan be recalled from office for misfeasance, malfeasance, and violation of the oath of office, based on the following charge: Mayor Durkan endangered the peace and safety of the community and violated her duties under state and local laws and her oath to uphold the federal and state constitutions when she failed to institute new policies and safety measures for the Seattle Police Department after learning of the use of chemical agents on peaceful protesters as a means of crowd control during a public health emergency.” A court clerk is now expected to certify and submit the synopsis to Durkan, each petitioner and the county auditor, according to the ruling. The next step is for the petitioners to gather signatures. If enough are gathered and they are verified as belonging to legal voters, a judge will set a special election to be held between 45 and 90 days after the signatures are certified. The law urges that the special election be held on a scheduled election or special election day when possible, and prohibits it from being held between a primary and general election. In recent weeks, Seattle City Councilmembers Kshama Sawant, Teresa Mosqueda and Tammy Morales have asked Durkan to resign or consider resigning, specifically voicing a push to carve into the Police Department’s budget. Formas on Saturday reiterated that “Mayor Durkan won’t be distracted by Councilmember Sawant’s impeachment efforts.” The city of Seattle is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed last month by a group of Capitol Hill residents and businesses for the “extensive harm” they’ve faced as a result of CHOP, or the Capitol Hill Organized Protest."
Omar Demands US “Economy and Political Systems” Be Dismantled,8 JUL 2020,2408,"Ilhan Omar, the Muslim ‘refugee’ who came to the United States, benefitted from countless programs and free stuff, and then became a U.S. member of Congress has been plagued by various illegal scandals and actions. But, now she is calling for the deliberate dismantling of the United States economy and its “systems.” Breitbart News reported: Tuesday at a news conference on systemic racism with Minnesota leaders, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) called for dismantling systems of oppression, including America’s “economy and political systems.” Omar said, “Right now in Congress the Senate is sitting on a comprehensive bill to transform criminal justice and the policing system. All along with the Congressional Black Caucus, I helped led the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And because of Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, it is being ignored. I guess the president would rather attack the people who are protesting than actually address the issues people are out here protesting for.” She continued, “We can’t stop at criminal justice reform or police reform for that matter. We are not merely fighting to tear down the systems of oppression in the criminal justice system. We are fighting to tear down systems of oppression that exist in housing, in education, in health care, in employment, in the air we breathe.” She added, “The mortality rate for black Minnesotans to COVID is twice as high as it is with other races. And for me, this is very personal because I lost my own father to the coronavirus. I see the pain and the havoc it is wreaking on the black community in Minneapolis. We must recognize that these systems of oppression are linked. As long as our economy and political systems prioritizes profit without considering who is profiting, who is being shut out, we will perpetuate this inequity. So we cannot stop at criminal justice system. We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.” Watch her diatribe below: Congresswoman Ilhan Omar says we can’t stop at the criminal justice system and we must dismantle other systems of oppression like the US economy and political system. pic.twitter.com/FgcNxj7EfH — Benny (@bennyjohnson) July 7, 2020 What is it called when a sitting member of U.S. Congress calls for the ""dismantling"" of the U.S. economy and the entire system??? pic.twitter.com/JsPwqMinwF — Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) July 7, 2020"
Silent Majority Lights Up Los Angeles With Forbidden USA Celebration,6 JUL 2020,938,"Los Angeles Mayor, Eric Garcetti, issued a ban on fireworks celebrations for the city (based on COVID hype). Many people argue the move was designed to stop Americans from honoring their independence. But, Garcetti apparently didn’t realize the real number of Americans in his city. The sky was ablaze over the town on Saturday night. Disrn reported: A KCAL chopper captured a video of the city sky at 8:45 p.m.: A stunned KCAL reporter in the clip relayed that each person shooting off fireworks was subject to a potential $50,000 fine. According to L.A. Public Health, the ban on fireworks — which was instituted for the entire county — was ordered, along with the shuttering of beaches, to prevent the spread of COVID-19: Of course, many experts argue that such measures are simply the plan, and COVID is being used as an excuse, given that fatalities are dropping rapidly. They argue that vote-by-mail fraud is democrats’ only chance."
Trump Vindicated Again: Study Shows Hydroxychloroquine Works To Stop COVID Death,3 JUL 2020,5297,"In an interesting release, a new study has shown that the malaria drug touted by President Trump DOES actually reduce fatalities associated with COVID-19. Just The News reported: The anti-malaria drug that President Trump touted as a possible treatment for coronavirus, hydroxychloroquine, successfully lowered the death rate among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the most recent study of the drug. The large-scale analysis, conducted by Henry Ford Health System, was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The study examined 2,541 patients who had been hospitalized in six hospitals between March 10 and May 2, 2020. More than twenty-six percent (26.4%) of patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine died. But among those who received hydroxychloroquine, fewer than half that number — 13% — died. More than 90% of the patients received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to the hospital. Scientists say giving the drug early during illness may be a key to success. The study’s authors also found one concern flagged in previous reports about hydroxychloroquine did not materialize: heart-related adverse events. “The data here is clear that there was benefit to using [hydroxychloroquine] as a treatment for sick, hospitalized patients,” said Dr. Steven Kalkanis of Henry Ford Health System. The study scientists point out that other reports about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus that had less positive, mixed, or negative results studied different populations; administered hydroxychloroquine later during illness; used different doses, and/or were not peer-reviewed. President Trump was widely criticized in the media for saying that if hydroxychloroquine proves to work in treating coronavirus, it could be a game changer. In May, he told reporters that he, himself, took a course of the drug as a preventive measure after several White House officials were diagnosed with Covid-19. Trump says he suffered no ill effects from hydroxychloroquine. Henry Ford Health System is also studying 3,000 healthcare and frontline workers to see if hydroxychloroquine can prevent coronavirus. That study is titled: “Will Hydroxychloroquine Impede or Prevent COVID-19” or “WHIP COVID-19.” However, the study scientists say negative publicity and safety concerns about hydroxychloroquine — some of which they say is inaccurate or out of context — has made it difficult to recruit enough volunteers to take part. “Currently, the drug should be used only in hospitalized patients with appropriate monitoring, and as part of study protocols, in accordance with all relevant federal regulations,” says Dr. Marcus Zervos, co-author of study. Dozens of drugs are currently under study as possible treatments for coronavirus and multiple potential vaccines are in development. Cardiologist Dr. William O’Neill, a medical director at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan, first spoke with “Full Measure” about the study while it was underway in May. Detroit News reported: Officials with the Michigan health system said the study found the drug “significantly” decreased the death rate of patients involved in the analysis. … “As doctors and scientists, we look to the data for insight,” said Steven Kalkanis, CEO of the Henry Ford Medical Group. “And the data here is clear that there was a benefit to using the drug as a treatment for sick, hospitalized patients.” The study, published in the International Society of Infectious Disease, found patients did not suffer heart-related side effects from the drug. Patients with a median age of 64 were among those analyzed, with 51% men and 56% African American. Roughly 82% of the patients began receiving hydroxychloroquine within 24 hours and 91% within 48 hours, a factor Dr. Marcus Zervos identified as a potential key to the medication’s success. “We attribute our findings that differ from other studies to early treatment, and part of a combination of interventions that were done in supportive care of patients, including careful cardiac monitoring,” said Zervos, division head of infectious disease for the health system who conducted the study with epidemiologist Dr. Samia Arshad. Other studies, Zervos noted, included different populations or were not peer-reviewed. “Our dosing also differed from other studies not showing a benefit of the drug,” he said. “We also found that using steroids early in the infection associated with a reduction in mortality.” … Henry Ford Health has been working on multiple clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, including one that is testing whether the drug can prevent COVID-19 infections in first responders who work with coronavirus patients. The first responder clinical trial was trumpeted by Trump administration officials early in the pandemic. Many health care institutions, including the World Health Organization, suspended clinical trials of the drug touted by President Donald Trump after a faulty study was published in the British medical journal The Lancet on May 22. The WHO restarted the trials in June. The study is vital, Zervos said, as medical workers prepare for a possible second wave of the virus and there is plenty of research that still needs to be conducted to solidify an effective treatment."
