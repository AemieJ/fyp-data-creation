CHINESE HEALTH MINISTRY CONFIRM PATIENT ZERO ‘HAD SEX WITH BATS’,930,"Yin Dao Tang, 24, from the province of Hubei, is the first case of the novel coronavirus that emerged on November 17, according to Chinese government data. Tang is believed to have contracted the disease after indulging in sexual acts with several animals, including bats. Chinese officials have warned to temporarily abstain from having sexual contact with any animals, especially with bats. “We ask the population to abstain temporarily from oral, genital or anal sexual contact with animals, especially bats,” Chinese officials warned citizens yesterday. The Chinese government said it would consider fines and prison time to enforce that the population temporarily abstains from sexual contact with animals until the pandemic is fully controlled. China’s millennial-old cultural traditions have made the bat a synonym of healthy sexual appetite, longevity, good eyesight and luck and are a popular dish in the region of Hubei."
BELGIUM HEALTH MINISTER PUTS BAN ON NON-ESSENTIAL SEXUAL ACTIVITIES,794,"Health Minister de Block announced today that, effective immediately, “non-essential” sexual activities of 3 people or more are banned in Belgium to combat the spread of COVID-19. De Block said she was forced to act swiftly because of Belgium’s reputation as being the “beer-drinking” and “group sex capital of Europe.” Health minister De Block did not ban single or two-person sexual practices such as masturbation, anal or oral sex, or even bestiality. “These measures apply only to human-to-human sexual contact, not human-to-animal contact,” she added when questioned about bestiality by reporters. A 2018 survey revealed that more than 78% of Belgian couples openly practice wife swapping, a cultural trait that became common practice in the 19th century under the rule of King Leopold II."
SCIENTIST CLAIM THAT WOMEN WITH BIG BUTTS ARE SMARTER AND HEALTHIER,2247,"Researchers at the Oxford University have released the results of a research that suggests that women who welded bigger behinds had lower risks of coming down with diseases. It also went on to say that such women turned out to be smarter than their counterparts. Isn’t that interesting? Well, they went ahead to say that women with bigger butts had lower levels of cholesterol which in turn meant that their hormones help them to burn sugar quickly. They also went on to suggest that women with larger behinds were at lower risks of developing cardiac conditions, diabetes and similar diseases that are related to the unhealthy amounts of cholesterol ingested and inherent in the body. The reason for this? The large deposits of Omega 3 Acids that are present in these women’s bodies. These minerals that are naturally gifted this women, all help improve the brain function of these women. The Greek Professor, Konstantinos Manolopoulos – who also doubles as the leader of the research at the University of Oxford, told reporters of ABC News that women with more fat on their buttocks have a higher glucose and cholesterol levels in their bodies. The results of these researchers were based on a sample of 16,000 women who volunteered for the experiment. The reports go on to explain that having a more prominent buttocks for women, aids in the release of higher levels of leptin – a hormone that controls the process of weight gain and loss in the body. This helps such women have more regulated weights throughout the year compared to their counterparts. Another hormone that is released in higher amounts in bodies of big butt ladies is Adiponectin. This is a hormone that helps in preventing diabetic problems in the body. It is also responsible for the vascular-protective attributes. It also goes on to show that the adipose tissue of the buttocks of such women helps trap fatty particles that could cause body issues such as cardiovascular diseases. When these experiments were repeated by two well-known universities – in Pittsburgh and California, they came back with similar results. Everything points to the fact that women with smaller waists, wider hips and bigger butts have the longer life expectancies when compared to other women."
New Study Shows Women With Larger Butts Are Healthier & More Intelligent,1708,"Having a little “junk in the trunk” is good for women health. Not only does having a larger derriere boost overall health, but it’s tied to increased intelligence and lower risk of chronic disease, according to researchers at the University of Oxford and Churchill Hospital in the United Kingdom. According to the researchers, Fat distribution is very important, and if you’re going to have some, it’s best to have it below the waist, as it stops heart disease, diabetes and other conditions linked to obesity. 
Researchers say, If you’re pear-shaped, you’re probably in a good place, but if you’re apple-shaped, you may want to embark on a healthier lifestyle. Women with belly fat have more obesity-related issues and problems than those who carry extra weight on their hips, thighs and butt. Belly fat “is more metabolically active,” explains Kushner, meaning it has a greater effect on the brain and overall body, compared to fat stored in the lower half, which tends to be more stable and invokes fewer cytokines or proteins associated with insulin resistance and the onset of diabetes. Another major factor tied to fat distribution in women is leptin. Leptin levels, crucial for regulating appetite, are correlated with a bigger derriere, too. Women who are obese, their brain stops responding to the hormone entirely, causing the person to develop leptin resistance, which is similar to insulin resistance. Maintaining a larger behind requires significant amounts of Omega 3 fats, which are proven to boost brain function, memory and cognitive abilities. Research also shows that children born to women with wide hips are more intelligent compared to those conceived by thinner and less curvy mothers."
DENMARK GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY LEGALIZES ‘SEX WITH DOMESTIC ANIMALS’ DURING CORONA-VIRUS,1025,"Denmark had become one of the last European countries to ban bestiality in 2015 but parliamentarians chose to suspend the law this week for an undetermined period of time. Police forces in Copenhague were overwhelmed by citizens denouncing their neighbors having sex with their domestic animals during the confinement, forcing Parliament to temporarily legalize bestiality until the pandemic is over. When asked if the law could be sustained indefinitely after the pandemic, Prime Minister Frederiksen said she was not closed to the idea. “Many things will change after the end of the pandemic, maybe the population will wish to carry on with such practices. The people will decide,” Frederiksen told reporters. Imam Mohammed Eriksson Shroeder, a representative of the Danish Shia Muslim community, praised the announcement and said it was great news for the Shia and Sunni Muslim communities alike explaining that the practice had always conformed to Islamic law “if, and only, the animal is butchered after the sexual act.”"
16 STATES REPORT AR-15 SHORTAGES AS AMERICANS “PROTECT THEMSELVES” FROM PANDEMIC,1241,"According to official numbers, over 5.5 million AR-15 style rifles, 32 million other firearms, and 1.2 billion ammunition have been sold over the last three weeks across the United States. These astonishing numbers come as several gun stores now offer their own take-out, drive-by or even delivery services to reduce health risks posed by the coronavirus to their employees and customers. According to Bill Matthews, owner of three gun stores in Norfolk, Virginia, people rushed to buy guns to protect themselves and their property as unemployment has skyrocketed recently across the country. Enrique Morales, owner of the Gun ‘r Us store in Miami reports that people of all ages fear the actual situation will lead to pillaging and looting as millions find themselves without income. Several states have already announced they would review their list of essential services to include firearm manufacturers, but only Virginia, Florida and Georgia have done it already. Experts expect the country could face several temporary shortages before the production can compensate for the increased demand. Several types of high-caliber ammunition, as well as some models of shotguns and assault rifles could suffer shortages over the next few weeks."
