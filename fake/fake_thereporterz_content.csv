"Women’s health tech brand, Elvie, tops up Series C to $97M – TechCrunch",2553,"Elvie, the pioneer in women’s health technology behind an attached breast pump and smart pelvic floor trainer, topped up a Series C announced earlier this summer (July) – adding another £ 12.7 million to bring the total to £ 70 million increase ($ 97 million). Founded in 2013, the UK-based startup previously rallied 42 million products designed for (and often by) women in 2019, have gained a lot of momentum during that time as women-led startups have paved and shown a path that there is a sizable market for femtech – which is causing investors to slow down the opportunity too. Analysts believe the femtech industry will become a $ 50 billion market by 2025. Elvie says the Series C expansion will include funds sponsored by the co-founders of Blume Equity – a PE company focused on the food and healthcare sectors – as well as additional capital from existing investors IPGL, Hiro Capital and Westerly Winds . In July, when Elvie took the previous ($ 80 million) The Series C will be used to drive more growth through geographic expansion (including entering new markets) and diversifying its product portfolio to address other “key phases” in women’s lives, it said. That means it will invest in research and development to support product development – networked hardware connecting physical devices to software still seems to be a strong focus – and also on strengthening its operations and infrastructure to focus on to prepare another scaling. Elvie currently sells four products: its connected cone trainer and a portable breast pump (plus two non-electric pumps). It will be interesting to see where the company is going next in terms of the product. In a statement, Tania Boler, CEO and Founder said: “Elvie is ready for the next phase of our growth. We’ve already revolutionized the categories we operate in, but we know there is tremendous untapped potential to develop better technology products and services for women in new areas. “ She added that Elvie’s goal is to create “the one stop shop for women’s health at all stages of life” and to sell “sophisticated, accurate and personalized solutions” to the target female audience. Elvie isn’t breaking product sales, but it did tell us that its pumps business in the US has doubled in the last 12 months – and adds that they are the top sales driver on Amazon in the US for single breast pumps. The company is also promoting “strong” growth for its European business – at 139% year over year. While the UK market recorded further growth of + 31% year-on-year over the past 12 months."
COVID recovery could include lingering mental health concerns,12282,"MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin – Antolin „Kiko“ Ojeda ist seit 2016 clean, aber es wird schwieriger für ihn, nüchtern zu bleiben, seit er sich vom Coronavirus erholt hat, sagt er. „Meine psychische Gesundheit scheint zusammengebrochen zu sein“, sagte Ojeda. „Wo ich alles richtig gut im Griff hatte … ist es fast so, als würde ich noch einmal von vorne anfangen. Auch bei den Suchtproblemen verspüre ich die Angst, wieder konsumieren zu wollen. Damit habe ich mich seit vier Jahren nicht mehr auseinandersetzen müssen.“ Der körperliche Kampf von Menschen, die sich mit COVID-19 infiziert haben, kann laut Experten für psychische Gesundheit oft zu psychischen Problemen und Schuldgefühlen führen, die denen ähnlich sind, die einen traumatischen Autounfall überlebt haben. Andrew Schramm, klinischer Traumapsychologe am Medical College of Wisconsin, sagte, die Überweisungsraten für Patienten, die psychisch mit Traumata zu kämpfen haben, seien von 2019 bis 2020 um etwa 70 % gestiegen. „Es gibt eine Kombination von Faktoren, die diesen Anstieg erklären. Es liegt nicht nur am Virus“, sagte Schramm. „Dies ist eine Zeit, in der die Menschen aus vielen verschiedenen Blickwinkeln mit viel Stress konfrontiert sind.“ Verwandte Geschichte:Kindergeburtstagsfeiern haben möglicherweise die Verbreitung von COVID-19 angeheizt, Studienergebnisse Ojeda sagte, seine Kämpfe mit COVID-19 hätten im vergangenen Herbst begonnen, als er ein Gefängnisinsasse war. Im September meldete sich Ojeda, ein Navy-Veteran, beim Taylor County Jail, um eine Strafe im Zusammenhang mit dem Bekenntnis zu einer Anklage wegen des Handels mit Amphetaminen im Jahr 2017 zu verbüßen. Im Gefängnis habe er sich mit COVID-19 infiziert, sagte Ojeda. “So ziemlich jeder Typ in meinem Block wurde positiv getestet”, sagte Ojeda. “Von 10 von uns wurden acht positiv getestet, einschließlich mir.” Ojeda verlor seinen Geruchs- und Geschmackssinn, seine Energie war schwach und er war kurzatmig. Er brauchte ungefähr zwei Wochen, um sich von dem Virus zu erholen und negativ zu testen, und er ist dankbar, dass er es nicht an seine Frau und seinen Sohn weitergegeben hat. „Es sind nicht nur die physischen Aspekte. Ich meine, es macht mich auch mental wirklich (Kraftausdruck) “, sagte Ojeda und fügte hinzu, dass er über sich selbst frustriert ist, wenn er nicht mit seinem 6-jährigen Sohn spielen, seiner Frau helfen oder mit seinem Hund spazieren gehen kann, weil er immer noch Geschäfte macht mit den dauerhaften Auswirkungen des Virus. COVID-Impfstoff haben, reisen:Dies sind die Länder, die vollständig geimpften Amerikanern offenstehen „Körperlich und mental hat man einfach nicht die Energie dazu, und das führt zu einer Depression, weil man sich wie ein Stück (Kraftausdruck) fühlt, weil man sich nicht um sein Kind und seinen Hund kümmern kann. Es ist nur eine große Spirale, die sich im Kreis dreht.“ Ojeda sagte, seit seiner Genesung fühle er sich ängstlicher, habe Probleme beim Einschlafen oder schlafe zu viel und habe Konzentrationsprobleme, die er alles auf die Auswirkungen des Coronavirus auf ihn zurückführt. „Es ist überwältigend“, sagte Ojeda. „Wenn Sie einfach nie die Energie zu haben scheinen, die Sie hatten, oder wenn Sie Schwierigkeiten beim Atmen haben, habe ich das Gefühl, immer eine Erkältung oder meine Körpertemperatur zu haben, ich kann es anscheinend überhaupt nicht regulieren.“ Nach Angaben des staatlichen Gesundheitsministeriums haben sich in Wisconsin mehr als 600.000 Menschen mit dem Virus infiziert und erholt. Während viele Menschen, die das Virus hatten, asymptomatisch waren, wurden mehr als 31.000 Menschen ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert und andere, wie Ojeda, kämpften mit dem Virus, während sie in ihrem Haus unter Quarantäne standen. Terri Ellzey, Direktorin der klinischen Dienste für Mental Health America in Wisconsin, sagte, das Virus habe mehr bewirkt, als „nur die Menschen krank zu machen“, und die Krankenhausrichtlinien, die Menschen von Besuchen mit ihren Lieben einschränkten oder untersagten, führten zu zusätzlichem Stress. “Viele Menschen haben möglicherweise Familienmitglieder verloren, von denen sie sich aufgrund dieser Einschränkungen nicht verabschieden konnten”, sagte Ellzey. „Obwohl wir verstehen, dass wir, wenn wir einen geliebten Menschen auf dem Sterbebett haben, seine Hand nicht halten können … das kann sehr schwer sein.“ Der Umgang mit dem Tod eines geliebten Menschen, insbesondere an der Ursache des Virus, sei schwieriger geworden, sagte Ellzey. Bewusstsein für psychische Gesundheit:Wenn Sie weiterhin Arbeit vor Gesundheit und Glück stellen, leiden Sie möglicherweise unter einem verinnerlichten Kapitalismus “Ich habe eine junge Dame, mit der ich zusammenarbeite, die Überlebensschulden hat, weil sie das Gefühl hat, als ihr Vater letztes Jahr an COVID und Zirrhose starb, dass sie mehr hätte tun können”, sagte Ellzey. „Ich bin wie ‚Du kannst dir dafür keine Vorwürfe machen.’ Und das ist leichter gesagt als getan. Das ist ihre Realität. Darüber kommt sie nicht hinweg.” Melanie Ricks, 29, erinnert sich immer wieder daran, dass das Schlimmste vorbei ist. Es ist mehr als sechs Monate her, dass Ricks sich zugezogen und das Coronavirus überwunden hat, und obwohl sie negativ ist, wird sie immer noch an ihren Kampf mit dem Virus erinnert. „Ich bekomme definitiv immer noch Atemnot, meine Energie ist nur nicht ganz dieselbe“, sagte Ricks. Ricks arbeitet als In-Game-Moderatorin für die Milwaukee Bucks, aber während der Saison 2020 arbeitete sie nicht für das Team, da NBA-Spiele ohne Fans in der Arena ausgetragen wurden. Als sie gegen das Virus kämpfte, sagte Ricks, sie habe Panikattacken gehabt und nachdem sie sich erholt hatte, hatte sie Momente, in denen sie das Gefühl hatte, “der Raum schließt sich mir an”. „Als ich COVID hatte und auch nach COVID, hatte ich das Gefühl, in einem Körper gefangen zu sein, der nicht mir gehörte“, sagte Ricks. „Ich hatte das Gefühl, die Kontrolle über mich selbst verloren zu haben, und es ist ein sehr bizarres Gefühl, weil ich es nicht genau erklären kann. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass man es nur verstehen kann, wenn man es selbst durchmacht. … Von einer mentalen Seite her hat mich COVID wirklich, wirklich durcheinander gebracht.“ Ricks ‘Großvater hat das Virus vor ihr infiziert und ist einer von mehr als 7.235 Menschen, die in Wisconsin an dem Virus gestorben sind. Sie verstand nicht, warum sie das Virus überleben konnte, während es so viele andere nicht taten. Ricks sprach mit ihrem Arzt über ihre Gefühle und ihr Arzt schlug vor, dass sie sich möglicherweise “Schuld des Überlebenden” fühlte, mit der sie sich identifizierte. „Ich hatte nicht erwartet, dass mich das mental beeinflusst“, sagte Ricks. Während sie sich körperlich verbesserte, sagte Ricks, dass sie sich geistig verbesserte und diejenigen, die sich erholen, ermutigte, alles zu tun, was sie brauchen, um sich besser zu fühlen. „Sie müssen selbst herausfinden, was Sie am besten tun können“, sagte Ricks. „Ich glaube nicht, dass es dafür ein perfektes Heilmittel gibt und das muss ich definitiv lernen.“ Für Ricks, letztes Jahr arbeitslos zu sein und kein zuverlässiges Einkommen zu haben, verstärkte ihre Angst. “Es wurde wirklich, wirklich beängstigend”, sagte Ricks über ihre finanzielle Situation. Ricks meldete sich arbeitslos und griff in ihre Ersparnisse, um über die Runden zu kommen, und erinnerte sich, dass sie dachte: “Ich kann nicht mehr lange von meinen Ersparnissen leben.” Aber Ricks schätzt sich glücklich, dass sie sich über Wasser halten konnte, bis sie einen neuen Job als Morgenradiomoderatorin bekam und in dieser Saison wieder Bucks-Spiele moderierte. Normale Bewältigungstechniken wie Sport, das Zusammensein mit geliebten Menschen und die Teilnahme an angenehmen Aktivitäten sind schwieriger durchzuführen, da Menschen und Unternehmen ihre körperlichen Interaktionen einschränken. Schramm sagte, es gebe eine „Verhaltenslast“, die der Gesellschaft aufgebürdet werde, um zu versuchen, die Menschen zu schützen, was Stress und Angst verursachen kann. „Fast jeder Patient, mit dem ich zusammengearbeitet habe, hatte Coronavirus-Berichte über erhöhte Angstgefühle und Depressionen“, sagte Schramm. Viele COVID-19-Patienten müssen sich alleine erholen. „Diese Patienten müssen in einer Zeit, in der sie unter erhöhtem Stress stehen und mehr denn je soziale Unterstützung benötigen, in Quarantäne und von Menschen fern sein“, sagte Schramm. Nach der Genesung sagte Schramm, dass Kurzatmigkeit ausreichen könnte, um bei jemandem, der sich erholt hat, eine Panikattacke auszulösen. „Es ist eine so persönliche Erfahrung und es gibt kein richtig oder falsch in Bezug auf die Emotionen, die hochkommen“, sagte Schramm. „Wir geraten in Schwierigkeiten, wenn wir versuchen, unsere emotionale Reaktion zu sehr zu kontrollieren oder diese emotionale Reaktion als gut oder schlecht einzuschätzen.“ Schramm sagte, diejenigen, die sich von dem Virus erholt haben oder jemanden verloren haben, könnten sich fragen: “Was hätte ich anders machen können?” „Oft ist es schwer zu akzeptieren, dass wir in solchen Situationen zu wenig Kontrolle haben“, sagt Schramm. „Wir wünschten, wir könnten die Geschichte zurückspulen und neu schreiben, aber das können wir nicht.“ Während Ärzte und Forscher immer noch mehr über das Virus erfahren, ist es noch relativ unbekannt, wie lange jemand unter den psychischen Auswirkungen des Virus leiden könnte. „Menschen, die immer noch einige körperliche Symptome haben, denken eher noch, dass sie gefährdet sind oder dass sich ihr Leben dauerhaft verändert hat“, sagte Chad Wetterneck, klinischer Direktor für Traumawiederherstellung bei Rogers Behavioral Health. „Also, bis es weg ist, und das ist der Teil, über den wir nicht genug wissen, möchten wir normalisieren, dass sie sich so fühlen. Wir möchten normalisieren, dass Menschen manchmal viel längere Auswirkungen haben, aber wir möchten auch nicht darauf achten, diese Auswirkungen zu überwachen. Was wirklich schwer ist, Menschen in ihrem Leben zu reduzieren.“ Dieser Balanceakt, die eigenen Gefühle gegenüber dem Virus anzuerkennen und diese Gefühle nicht den Alltag bestimmen zu lassen, kann für manche Menschen schwierig sein. „Wir sagen nicht, dass du den Gedanken ignorierst, dass du dich niedergeschlagen oder gestresst fühlst oder dass du dich nicht als Teil deines Körpers fühlst, sondern akzeptiere es und entscheide dich dennoch dafür, so viel von der Aktivität zu unternehmen, die für dich gesund ist.“ sagte Wetterneck. “Denn wenn sie zu viel einschränken, werden sie wahrscheinlich einige ihrer Bewältigungsfähigkeiten und ihre Art und Weise, wie sie ihre Gesundheit erhalten, verlieren, sei es durch zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen oder tatsächliche Aktivitäten, Ausgehen und Sport.” Wenn die Pandemie andauert, wird auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit ihrer Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit steigen. „Davon werden wir noch mehr sehen“, sagte Wetterneck. „Menschen, die Schwierigkeiten haben, mit den Auswirkungen zurechtzukommen, wenn sie entweder COVID bekommen oder ihre Lieben COVID bekommen.“ Eine positive Sache, die sich durch die Pandemie möglicherweise geändert hat, ist laut Ellzey die Wahrnehmung, nach psychischer Gesundheit zu suchen. “Das Stigma zuvor war, dass niemand zugeben will, dass ich verrückt werde” oder so etwas”, sagte Ellzey. „Ich denke, den Menschen wird sich immer mehr bewusst, wie Menschen in Krisenzeiten brechen können. Und wie Krisen dazu führen können, dass Menschen ganz, ganz unterschiedlich reagieren.“ Schramm ermutigt jeden, der psychisch mit den Auswirkungen des Coronavirus zu kämpfen hat, sich Hilfe von einem Fachmann oder einem geliebten Menschen zu suchen. „Dies ist eine Zeit in unserer Geschichte, in der wir als Gemeinschaft ein hohes Maß an Stress und Belastung unserer normalen Ressourcen zur Bewältigung erfahren, einzeln oder kollektiv“, sagte Schramm. „Ich möchte, dass die Leute wissen, dass sie damit nicht allein sind und dass, wenn diese Gefühle von Depression oder Angst, Schuldgefühlen Sie wirklich so sehr stören, dass sie Sie davon abhalten, Dinge zu tun, die Ihnen wichtig sind, sich einmischen mit deinem Leben, dass es Kraft braucht, um zu erkennen, dass dies eine Zeit ist, um Hilfe zu suchen.“ Folgen Sie Ricardo Torres auf Twitter: @Ricoreporting."
Health clouds are set to play a key role in healthcare innovation – TechCrunch,3987,"Abhinav Shashank

Contributor Innovaccer founder and CEO Abhinav Shashank has written more than 300 articles for various international media and was also listed in Forbes’ “30 Under 30 Asia 2017: Enterprise Tech” and among the “Top 60 Rising Leaders in US Healthcare under 40” by Becker’s Hospital Review 2019. Mike Sutten, CTO at Innovaccer, has more than two decades of IT leadership experience at Fortune 500 companies including Kaiser Permanente, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and General Electric, as well as serving as CTO and Deputy CIO at the CIA. The US health care system The industry is in the midst of one of the biggest changes any industry has seen since the dot-com boom in the late 1990s. This massive change is being promoted by federal mandates, technological innovations and the need to improve clinical outcomes and communication between providers, patients and payers. An aging population, an increase in chronic illnesses, lower reimbursement rates and a shift to value-based payments – as well as the COVID-19 pandemic – have increased the pressure and highlighted the need for new technologies to improve virtual and value-based care. In order to improve medical outcomes, huge amounts of health data must be processed today, and the cloud plays a central role in meeting the current needs of health organizations. Most of today’s healthcare challenges fall into two broad categories: rapidly increasing costs and increasing stress on resources. Rising costs – and the resulting inadequacy of health resources – can be caused by: An aging population: As people get older and live longer, healthcare becomes more expensive. As medicine improves, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 20% of the US population by 2030, according to the US Census Bureau. And as older people spend more on health care, an aging population is expected to contribute to rising health care costs over time. Chronic Disease Prevalence: According to a report from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, treating chronic illness accounts for 85% of health care costs, and more than half of all Americans have a chronic illness (diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, lower back and neck pain, etc.) Higher outpatient costs: Outpatient care costs, including outpatient hospital services and emergency rooms, rose the most of all treatment categories covered in a 2017 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association. Rising health premiums, own costs as well as Medicare and Medicaid: Health premiums increased by an estimated 54% between 2009 and 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred participation in government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, which has increased overall demand for medical services and contributed to rising costs. A 2021 IRS report highlighted that a shift to high-deductible health insurance – with out-of-pocket expenses of up to $ 14,000 per family – also increased healthcare costs. Delayed Care and Operations Due to COVID-19: A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) in May 2020 found that up to 48% of people have avoided or postponed medical care due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. About 11% of these people said their health deteriorated after they skipped or postponed treatment. Non-emergency surgeries were often postponed as resources became available for COVID-19 patients. These delays make treatable diseases more expensive and increase the overall cost. Lack of price transparency: Without transparency, it is difficult to determine the real cost of health care. The fragmented data landscape does not capture complete details and complex medical bills and does not give patients a complete overview of payments. To mitigate the impact of increased costs and inadequate resources, healthcare organizations need to replace outdated IT programs and adopt modern systems that support rapid innovation for location-independent, collaborative, holistic care – all at affordable and accessible prices."
"One of America’s largest hospital chains, Community Health Systems, has been suing patients during the pandemic",23197,"But even as Bull was helping send patients to Moberly Regional, the hospital was in the process of suing her and at least one other former employee at the nursing home. They were two of more than 600 former patients that the hospital has sued over medical bills during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a CNN analysis of court records. Moberly Regional sued Bull last May for $9,281, costs that Bull said came from an emergency room visit for food poisoning several years ago. After a judge ruled in the hospital’s favor late last year, the company filed a motion to start garnishing part of her roughly $850-per-month salary. Bull, who also receives disability payments, said she and her husband both contracted Covid-19 last summer, and they’ve struggled to pay their bills each month. “I tried to reason with the lawyers and tell them there’s no way I can pay for this, but nothing worked,” Bull said. “Having this huge bill looming over my head — it’s been stressful, it’s been heart-sickening.” Bull’s experience is hardly unique. Hospitals owned by Community Health Systems, Inc., one of America’s largest hospital chains, have filed at least 19,000 lawsuits against their patients over allegedly unpaid medical bills since March 2020, even as other hospitals around the country have moved to curtail similar lawsuits during the coronavirus pandemic, a CNN investigation found. The company’s 84 hospitals, which are concentrated in the South and stretch from Alaska to Key West, Florida, have taken their patients to court for as little as $201 and as much as $162,000. They say litigation is a last resort. CNN’s review of court filings across 16 states the company operates in found that most of the patients sued by CHS — like Bull — didn’t hire a lawyer or fight the lawsuits, and judges often ruled in the company’s favor by default. In some states, defendants’ debts piled on with attorney’s fees and interest. Elsewhere, the hospital chain’s subsidiaries quickly moved to garnish defendants’ paychecks after a judgment. Advocates say those hardball collection tactics can leave low-income patients in financial ruin — especially considering the lawsuits were filed in the middle of the Covid-fueled economic collapse. “I can’t think of a worse thing a hospital system can be doing than suing patients for medical bills during a pandemic and a recession,” said Caitlin Donovan, the spokeswoman for the National Patient Advocate Foundation, a patients’ rights group. CHS in 2020 enjoyed its most profitable year in at least a decade, even as it was suing patients during the pandemic. The company made $511 million in net income last year, a big swing after four straight years of annual losses. That strong financial result led to the company’s top executives earning millions of dollars worth of bonuses, according to documents it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One reason for the success: CHS has been buoyed by taxpayer support. It received $705 million in pandemic-related aid from the federal government’s CARES Act and other state and local programs in 2020, not including additional government loans it will have to pay back, according to its 2021 annual report to shareholders. In a statement to CNN, CHS said its hospitals only sue a “small fraction” of the patients they treat every year, and that they work to provide assistance for those who can’t afford their bills. “Legal action is always the last resort,” the company said. CHS hospitals only file lawsuits, it said, “after it is determined the patient appears to have some ability to pay based on credit record and employment status or if the patient has been non-responsive” following repeated attempts to discuss their bill. The company said its hospitals do not “initiate litigation against any patient we know lost his or her job because of the pandemic,” and that under a new policy it adopted earlier this year, it would withdraw lawsuits against anyone making less than 200% of the federal poverty level — $25,760 for an individual. But many patients failed to fill out a form outlining their finances that could make them eligible for those reprieves or other aid, it said. Patients being sued and lawyers who work on the cases say that the company’s rhetoric doesn’t always hold up. CNN interviewed more than a dozen people sued by CHS hospitals. Most said they had tried to communicate with the company’s lawyers, collections agents or the hospitals directly and found them unresponsive or unwilling to agree to a settlement they could afford. Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins University professor who has studied hospital lawsuits around the country, said CHS was far more litigious than most hospital groups, and that the company’s financial aid policy didn’t go nearly far enough. “It’s like Marie Antoinette saying, ‘if somebody came to me begging for food, I would give them cake,'” Makary said. “It’s completely blind to the relentless, aggressive, predatory nature of debt collection on the ground.” CHS, which is based in a Nashville suburb, is a for-profit company that was founded in 1985. At its peak in 2014, it operated more hospitals across the U.S. than any other company, according to Modern Healthcare, a trade publication. It has sold off some of its facilities since then but is still ranked among the 10 largest hospital chains in the country. The company’s practice of suing patients isn’t a new development: Many of its hospitals have brought large numbers of patients to court for years. The total number of lawsuits filed dipped in the spring of 2020, as many courthouses shut down in the early days of the pandemic, but then picked up again in the summer and fall. While the lawsuits were filed during the pandemic, they are typically over years-old medical bills. To identify cases, CNN searched court records for lawsuits brought by a list of about 100 CHS subsidiaries, including those operating the company’s 84 current hospitals and others that ran more than a dozen facilities that CHS sold or closed during 2020 and early 2021. CNN found about 24,000 lawsuits filed by the company’s hospitals, including more than 19,000 filed on or after March 13, 2020, when the federal government declared a national emergency over Covid-19. The review only included cases in which the hospitals sued individual people, as opposed to insurance companies. In states where information about cases was available online, CNN limited its review to lawsuits marked as related to debt, collections or monetary claims. The company’s six Alabama hospitals filed at least 4,900 lawsuits during all of 2020 and the first four months of 2021, but the state’s court case search system does not make it possible to identify how many were filed after the pandemic gripped the U.S. or how many were debt-related. The other top states CHS hospitals filed lawsuits in were Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas. Nationwide, roughly three-fourths of the company’s hospitals have filed at least a dozen lawsuits against patients since March 2020. CNN was able to obtain court records from most but not all counties where CHS operates a hospital, so the findings are likely an undercount. CHS is hardly the only hospital group that has sued patients, but experts say its aggressive legal strategy stands out. Makary, the Johns Hopkins professor, said his research had found “a pattern across the U.S.” that CHS hospitals are among the most litigious. In Texas, for example, a Johns Hopkins study co-authored by Makary that covered about a fourth of the state’s counties found that only 7% of local hospitals sued any patients between January 2018 and February 2020. Nine of the top 10 most litigious hospitals in the state identified by the researchers were owned by CHS. CHS questioned the report’s methodology, saying it was skewed because the researchers included counties where the company’s hospitals operate and not all counties in the state. Makary said the research did not target CHS hospitals. Spokespeople for three other of the largest national hospital chains — HCA Healthcare, LifePoint Health and CommonSpirit Health — said their hospitals do not sue patients over unpaid bills. Trinity Health, another large chain, suspended collections activity in March 2020 due to the pandemic and has “significantly limited any pursuit of legal action involving past due accounts,” a spokesperson said, although she declined to provide more details. Other hospitals around the country have publicly said they will avoid suing patients during the coronavirus pandemic. In New York, the state government ordered publicly run hospitals not to sue over medical debt during the pandemic, and most of the state’s privately-owned facilities followed suit. One large New York hospital group, Northwell, sued several thousand patients but changed its policy and dropped those cases after The New York Times wrote about its legal practices in January. CHS said that its hospitals don’t sell medical debt to third-party companies that then file lawsuits against patients, while some other hospitals do — a decision it said “skews any attempt to compare” its legal practices to other hospital groups. Most of the patients being sued by CHS who spoke to CNN said that they couldn’t afford to pay what the hospital was asking for. And letters to courts in cases around the country also raise questions about the company’s claims that it only tries to collect from patients who can afford to pay. After being sued by Lake Granbury Medical Center, a CHS hospital outside of Fort Worth, Texas, Richard Piper wrote to a judge in August asking for relief from the $34,894 in medical debt the hospital was demanding. “I am [writing] this response to inform you of my inability to [pay] this outstanding medical debt,” wrote Piper, who works at a salvage yard. “I only bring home a check of 525 dollars a week and have [been] helping two daughters with my grandkids… my prayer to you is please relieve some of this debt and help out the average person.” Instead, the judge entered a default judgment against him, ordering him to pay the full amount as well as nearly $3,500 in attorney’s fees for the hospital’s lawyers — bills from a 2018 hospital stay. Piper said in an interview that his bill came after the hospital kept him longer than he had wanted, and that he was supporting his daughter’s family after she lost her job as a teacher due to Covid-19. “I don’t think it’s fair,” Piper said. “I can’t afford $35,000 — I don’t even make that in a year.” In another letter to an Oklahoma court in October, a former patient being sued by CHS hospital AllianceHealth Clinton wrote that her partner had been laid off because of pandemic shutdowns, she was working part-time at a job that offered no health insurance, and she was struggling to pay each month’s rent. “I am currently doing my best not to drown,” the woman wrote. “I do not have anything left to give. If you take my check from me, I would have no place to live.” The hospital continued with the lawsuit. Two months after she wrote the letter, the court entered a judgment against her — ordering her to pay the hospital her $781 debt and nearly doubling it by tacking on $400 in attorney’s fees and $304 in court costs. CHS said it could not comment on specific cases due to privacy regulations but that after reviewing the accounts of several patients who spoke to CNN, it is “satisfied that our hospitals followed their regular processes.” Many defendants were either uninsured or owed large co-pays or deductibles. Jennifer Alegria, a chef and manager at a cafe in North Carolina, didn’t have health insurance when she found a lump in her breast several years ago. She was diagnosed with breast cancer and received a double mastectomy at the CHS-owned Lake Norman Regional Medical Center in Mooresville — and then a sheriff’s deputy showed up on her doorstep last June to serve her with a $146,000 lawsuit from the hospital. Alegria relied on funds from a GoFundMe fundraiser started by her daughter to settle the case, agreeing to pay about $20,000, she said — still a huge sum for a single mother of three making less than $40,000 a year. She said she also fell behind on medical bills from other health providers during her cancer “nightmare,” but the CHS hospital was by the far the most aggressive in trying to collect, and the only one to sue her. “It felt like extortion,” Alegria said. “I was scared, and I just scrambled and tried to get some money together to pay it off.” Once a court rules against a defendant, the hospital can move to put a lien on property they own, such as a house, or garnish part of their wages, depending on regulations that vary from state to state. In Missouri, for example, CHS’s three hospitals moved to garnish defendants’ wages in more than half of the pandemic-era cases that resulted in a judgment. Many garnishments were for people working at relatively low-wage employers — the most common was Walmart. In its annual report, CHS acknowledged — in legal speak — that the pandemic is taking a toll on patients’ ability to pay their hospital bills. “We have observed deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable for uninsured patients in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the result of adverse economic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,” the company wrote. Christi Walsh, another Johns Hopkins researcher who has studied hospital lawsuits, said that it was typical for hospitals that sue patients to only make a tiny fraction of their revenue from those lawsuits. “It’s not keeping the lights on for the hospitals — they don’t need to be doing this,” Walsh said. “But for the patients, some of them go bankrupt, some of them have money taken directly out of their paychecks … They’re choosing between medical care and food.” In its statement to CNN, CHS defended its collections practices. In 2020, the company’s hospitals provided patients about $1 billion worth of “charity care,” which is not paid for, it said. Every patient is “given the option” to complete an application for financial assistance that could entitle them to free or discounted care — but many patients don’t fill out the form, the company said. “The challenge often is that patients do not respond to the hospital’s attempts to talk to them about their bills, so we do not know what impact, if any, the pandemic has had on a patients’ ability to pay for medical care,” CHS said. It urged defendants in lawsuits who have lost income during the pandemic or fallen below the poverty threshold to contact its collections office. “Sometimes, legal action is the only path through which patients will engage in a conversation about the amount they owe for healthcare services that have already been received,” it added. But Daniel Moore, a lawyer in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, who has defended dozens of low-income defendants sued by the CHS-owned Poplar Bluff Medical Center, laughed out loud when a reporter read him the company’s claim that it doesn’t try to collect from people who can’t afford to pay. “That’s total horseshit,” Moore declared. “Most of the people being sued are exactly those people… it just rains economic havoc down on them.” In most states, the lawsuits by the healthcare giant are a well-oiled machine. Local lawyers file claims for bills, including an affidavit from a hospital custodian of records. In many cases, the defendants never respond to the complaint or hire a lawyer, and CHS files for a default judgment against the defendant, which they are typically granted. Other cases see the hospital dismiss the lawsuit in exchange for defendants agreeing to a payment plan. On a Monday morning last month in Okaloosa County, a rural swath of the Florida panhandle, a judge held status conferences for 26 collections lawsuits brought by a CHS hospital, North Okaloosa Medical Center, in a hearing conducted over Zoom. Four of the defendants called in, smartphone videos showing them sitting in their cars or living rooms, and listened as Judge Jim Ward patiently explained what a judgment would mean: the potential for garnished wages, a lien on their property, and debts collecting interest. A lawyer for the hospital told them how much they owed. “I’m real behind on a lot of things,” Christine McCullough, one of the defendants, told Ward. According to the hospital, she owed $1,642 for an X-ray she received after a car accident. She told CNN in a later interview that that was the portion her insurance hadn’t covered — and as a hairstylist, she had seen her income drop during the pandemic, making her unable to afford the charge. Two defendants ended up agreeing to payment plans with the hospital, preventing a judgment from being filed against them unless they missed a bill. McCullough and another defendant had trial dates set. The rest of the cases were postponed, giving the hospital an opportunity to file for default judgment, or dismissed because the hospital had been unable to find the defendants to serve them with the lawsuit. None of the more than two dozen defendants whose cases were being heard that day had a lawyer. But around the country, some of the handful of defendants who hire lawyers found that they won their cases fairly easily. After Lake Norman Regional Medical Center sued Marianne Jurgens and her husband Robert for a $2,943 bill from Robert’s 2018 stay at the Mooresville, North Carolina, hospital, a court entered a default judgment against the couple. Jurgens said she told the hospital’s lawyers that the charges should have been covered by Medicare, but that they wouldn’t agree to drop the case. So she hired a lawyer who filed a motion to overturn the default. Several months later, the hospital admitted it had made a mistake. “After conducting an investigation into Defendant’s claims, Plaintiff believes there was an error in coding at the time of the procedure such that the Defendant should not be liable” for the payment, a lawyer for the hospital wrote in a filing in November, asking the court to throw the case out. L. Ragan Dudley, the lawyer who represented the Jurgens, said he wondered whether the hospital would have discovered other billing errors in the dozens of other lawsuits it filed last year if more of the patients being sued had lawyers. But in the U.S. defendants only have a right to legal representation in criminal cases, not civil lawsuits. Some of the other former patients sued by Lake Norman said they had no way to afford a lawyer. In September, the hospital sued Jeffery Turgeon for $20,784, costs that his fiancée Jennifer Matheson said stemmed from a four-day stay in 2019 as he suffered from stomach pain. Instead of a legal motion questioning the charges, Turgeon sent the court a handwritten letter on a sheet of notebook paper asking the hospital to settle the case. In February, Turgeon ended up agreeing to a judgment for the entire bill, plus $180 in court costs. The couple asked the hospital to let them pay $50 a month, but Matheson said they were told the minimum payment was $100 a month. Matheson says she lost her hospice care job due to the pandemic, and that the couple is barely able to make ends meet with the new expense. “Even something as simple as taking our kids to eat at McDonald’s, we can’t do that anymore,” she said. At the rate they’re paying now, it would take the couple 17 years to pay off the court judgment — and that doesn’t include the annual 8% interest that will continue to accrue. By the time the debt is repaid, “he’s going to be old,” Matheson said of her fiancé. “It feels like it’s never going to go away.” In recent years, CHS has been selling off many of its less profitable hospitals in an effort to pay down debt from its $7.6 billion acquisition of another hospital chain in 2014. But even after the company pulled out of hospitals, it didn’t stop suing its former patients. In St. Petersburg, Florida, CHS acquired Bayfront Health St. Petersburg, the city’s oldest and largest hospital, as part of the 2014 merger. Six years later, CHS sold the hospital to a nonprofit hospital group, Orlando Health, in a deal that was completed on October 1, 2020. But under the terms of the acquisition, CHS held onto the rights to claim all bills for medical services during its ownership of the hospital, an Orlando Health spokesperson said. The company’s lawsuits against patients spiked after it sold: It sued more than 400 patients in October, by far the highest number of lawsuits it had filed in any month since at least January 2017. Overall, Bayfront was among the most litigious hospital companies in the CHS network, filing more than 800 debt-related lawsuits since mid-March 2020. Orlando Health, the new owner, said in a statement that it has not sued any Bayfront patients over unpaid bills. But the flow of lawsuits from the CHS subsidiary — which still describes itself in court documents as “doing business as Bayfront Health St. Petersburg” — has continued, with new lawsuits filed as recently as last week. Other CHS subsidiaries in Florida, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas also continued to sue former patients after the hospitals they ran were sold to other companies over the last year. The new owners of eight of those hospitals told CNN that CHS had held onto the billing rights for past cases under the terms of their sales. One CHS hospital closed completely last year. Shands Lake Shore Regional Medical Center, which has served the small northern Florida community of Lake City since 1911, shut its doors as the number of patients declined over the years — and as the pandemic put a financial strain on many small and rural hospitals. The only part of the hospital that seems to have continued operating: its collections operation. The CHS subsidiary has sued 86 patients since mid-March 2020, including more than a dozen after the hospital ceased operations on August 31. Some of the defendants in cases brought by hospitals sold off by CHS told CNN that they hadn’t realized they were being sued by a company that no longer operated the hospital that treated them. Rashad Huntley, a maintenance worker and father of four young children in St. Petersburg, was sued by the CHS subsidiary that ran Bayfront hospital last month for $777.50 plus court costs — the amount his insurance didn’t cover after he received a half dozen stitches to a cut on his hand, Huntley said. Huntley said he and his wife make less than $71,000 a year and have four kids, which would appear to qualify them for CHS’ policy not to sue patients whose incomes are less than two times the poverty rate. But no one from the hospital had mentioned the policy to him until CNN told him about it last week, he said. “They don’t try to work it out or anything, they just demand the money,” Huntley, 30, said of the collections workers who had called him. “We’ve got car payments and rent and daycare fees, and still got to pay the lights and water.” “I understand it’s a business,” he added, “but I wish, during this time, they’d be more understanding.” The portrait in this story was taken remotely using a mobile app."

"Mental Health Match helps people find the right therapist, and finds a new home in Portland",1706,"New location of the startup: Mental Health Match, a startup helping people find the right therapist, has moved from Houston to Portland, Ore. The platform: Mental Health Match uses an online matching tool to guide users through choosing a therapist. More information on potential supervisors will be provided when they are identified as a match. The idea: The founder and CEO Ryan Schwartz came up with the idea when he was looking for a therapist for the first time after the death of his mother. Sitting across from a friend who was swiping through a dating app, he thought, “What if we could compete with a therapist like a romantic partner?” Increase in distress: As the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation affect people’s mental health, various startups and healthcare providers are introducing tools and services to address issues related to anxiety, depression, and more. Monetization and Traction: As of 2019, Mental Health Match has matched more than 60,000 people with a therapist and has therapists in all 50 states. They currently have 2,000 therapists on the platform with a total of 119 paying customers (30% conversion rate for studies). Therapists pay a monthly subscription to be part of the service. Financing: With three employees plus contractors / consultants, the startup has raised $ 1 million in start-up capital. Last word: “We all struggle to make sense of our fast-changing world, and a good therapist is one of the most helpful resources available,” Schwartz told KOIN’s “Am Extra” in Portland. “As more people realize it is time to speak to a trained professional, our matching tool enables Oregonians to find the provider they trust and connect with from the first moment.”"
Photos: Go inside the University of Washington’s new Hans Rosling Center for Population Health,2271,"The Hans Rosling Center for Population Health at the University of Washington in Seattle. (Kevin Scott Photos) A lot can change in the landscape in a year when social isolation is the norm. The University of Washington has completed the Hans Rosling Center for Population Health, and photos show a notable addition to the Seattle campus. The 300,000-square-foot building is the physical home of the UW’s Population Health Initiative, launched in 2016 as a collaborative effort to address the intersection of human health, environmental sustainability, and social and economic justice. The building was funded primarily through a gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of $ 210 million and earmarked funds from Washington State law of $ 15 million. It is named after the Swedish doctor Hans Rosling, who inspired the Gateses with his “rigorous analysis of the true state of the world and his passion for improving health,” according to the UW. The Rosling Center is home to the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation (IHME), an independent public health research center at UW Medicine, whose projections informed policy makers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Designed by The Miller Hull Partnership and built by Lease Crutcher Lewis, construction of the eight-story Rosling Center on the corner of 15th Avenue Northeast and Northeast Grant Lane began in April 2018. It features a variety of office types organized as a collection of neighborhoods with flexible options Spaces that can be adapted to changing needs. The boldest side of the building faces west, with physically static, 3-foot-deep glass fins that, according to Miller-Hull, “give pedestrians a sense of energetic movement and serve as a shaded canvas for changing light throughout the day”. The university had previously announced it would invest about $ 1.1 million in artwork for the building, split between about $ 85,000 from public funds and the rest from private donors The building is currently open to faculty, staff and students, but like the rest of the UW campus, it will continue to operate under Phase 2 guidance, strongly encouraging teleworking and distance learning. The hope is to return to largely face-to-face classes in the fall, or as the state’s Healthy Washington Plan allows."
Covid Surge in Michigan Alarms Health Experts,1908,"The country is a study of contrasts. New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and other northeastern states continue to report high levels of cases, and Illinois, Minnesota, and several other Midwestern states have seen worrying upward movements. In large parts of the south and west, however, the number of cases remains relatively low. California reports continued declines of about 2,600 cases per day, compared with more than 40,000 daily for much of January. Arizona has an average of 570 cases per day, compared with more than 10,000. And in Arkansas, fewer than 200 cases are announced on most days, a decrease of 40 percent in the past two weeks. But if any place offers any glimpse into the threat of a new climb, it’s Michigan. Health officials attributed the rapid rise in cases in part to variant B.1.1.7, which was originally identified in the UK and is widespread in Michigan. But they have also seen a wider return to pre-pandemic life, translating into an easing of mask wear, social distancing, and other strategies to slow the spread of the virus – many weeks before a significant portion of the population is vaccinated. Nationwide, more than 2,300 coronavirus patients are being hospitalized, a number that has more than doubled since the beginning of March. Five hospitals in the Henry Ford system in the Detroit area had a total of 75 coronavirus patients for the week of March 8. As of Tuesday, the hospitals were up to 267 patients. On Monday, the health system announced it would reintroduce a policy to limit visitor numbers at several hospitals in response to the recent surge. Dr. Adnan Munkarah, clinical director of the Henry Ford health system, said more coronavirus patients are now surviving the disease than in 2020, also because they are younger. But he’s frustrated, he said, and his staff is exhausted. “We were hoping that we would have better control of things now,” he said."
Healthy snack ideas for WFH,8659,"(CNN) – For many of us, working from home has not been without its challenges for most of 2020: zoom fatigue, dogs barking, and not an ounce of time alone have changed the reality of work as we know it. And whether you used to be used to fancy office perks, perhaps endless free snacks, or reduced your eating routine to a perfectly packed lunch box, the way we eat during work hours has also changed. In some ways, working from home makes it easier to nibble on endlessly, but if you pick the wrong thing to nibble on, you can zap and search for energy in the next bag of chips. To understand what kind of food can help us rather than hurt us during those long days of remote work, we tapped a handful of registered dietitians to share healthy wisdom about snacks and the products they personally turn to and which they recommend when hunger occurs. What Makes a Good, Healthy Snack? “A good snack is delicious, filling, and energizing,” says registered nutritionist Suzie Finkel, founder of Well Digested Nutrition, of her snack philosophy. Think of a snack like “a mini-meal in terms of nutrition, since it should ideally contain protein, healthy fat, and fiber,” says registered nutritionist Kelli McGrane, a contributing nutritionist for calorie counting app Lose It !. “All three nutrients are the key to a slow and steady release of energy. That way, instead of giving you a quick boost of energy and leaving you hungry an hour later, a balanced snack will keep you satisfied until your next meal. ” Protein, fat, and fiber are the keys to feeling full, adds Monica Auslander Moreno, founder of Essence Nutrition, but many snacks on the market are high in carbohydrates, which without any other nutrients can make you even hungrier than when you started. And a word to the wise: “Don’t pick a snack that you don’t like just because you’ve heard somewhere that it’s ‘healthy’,” says Finkel, noting that despite its healthy reputation, celery never does the trick for them did. A perfect snack will satisfy your taste buds, satisfy your hunger pangs, and give you energy to work through your activities a little longer until your next meal, she says. Moreno recommends looking for “added sugar” on a product’s nutrition label. While many nutritious foods are naturally high in sugar (such as dried mango), stick to snacks that are low to no sugar, which you can clearly see in the “Sugar” section of a food label. Another line of labels to review: fiber. “Fiber keeps you full, helps balance blood sugar, and supports cholesterol metabolism,” says Moreno. “I like to find a snack that has at least 4 grams of fiber per serving.” There is no doubt that browsing snack options on the internet can be as overwhelming as it is exciting. However, with the help of nutritionists, we’ve compiled a list of their favorite healthy snacks on Amazon that are as delicious as they are nutritious. PHOTO: Amazon Wednesday protein bars McGrane prefers these handy bars because “they’re made with just a handful of recognizable ingredients and contain plant-based protein to keep you full longer.” The Almond Butter Chocolate Brownie Flavor contains 4 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat (with just 1.5 grams of saturated fat), 11 grams of protein, and just 2 grams of added sugar. PHOTO: Amazon Icelandic Regulations Traditional Skyr Yogurt Having yogurt as a snack isn’t terribly groundbreaking, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. McGrane says Icelandic Provisions Skyr Yogurt is their preferred brand of yogurt because “it’s a little less spicy than other Icelandic yogurt brands, but is still high in protein and low in sugar.” The blueberry-blueberry flavor contains a whopping 15 grams of filling protein and only 6 grams of added sugar. McGrane suggests sprinkling some chia seeds or fresh berries on top to add fiber, which makes this snack a very well-rounded snack. PHOTO: Amazon Hippeas Organic Chickpea Puffs Vegan White Cheddar When crunchy cravings arise, reach for these and you won’t be hungry an hour later. “One serving of chickpea flour has an impressive 5 grams of fiber, 6 grams of protein, and just 0.5 grams of saturated fat,” says McGrane. Illuminated Bada Bean Bada Boom, pack of 24 Maybe you never thought of yourself the guy who eats beans. But here we are. These delightful snack packs are filled with protein- and fiber-rich broad beans that come in three flavors: sea salt, sweet sriracha and mesquite BBQ. (There are also options for other flavor mixes and packs of one flavor.) Don’t knock on the small but mighty bean: Each 100-calorie serving of this 100-calorie snack contains 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber. PHOTO: Amazon SkinnyDipped almonds with a dark chocolate espresso coating Call to all chocolate lovers! “These are perfect in case your sweet tooth pops out as they aren’t overly cute yet yet have a rich dark chocolate coating to make them satisfying,” says McGrane. Each 1-ounce serving contains 12 grams of fat (just 3 grams of saturated fat), 3 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, and just 6 grams of total sugar. Rhythm Superfoods beet chips, pack of 4 For potato chip fans looking for a healthier alternative, these dehydrated beet chips contain a surprising amount of protein and fiber (4 and 7 grams respectively) for such a humble nosh. The list of ingredients in the snack is impressively short as the only ingredient is organic beets – really! Peeled snacks organic dried fruit variety package, 4-pack Unlike many dried fruit snacks that have a disappointing amount of added sugars, this product relies entirely on the natural sweetness of the fruit. If your cute tooth is tingling, one of these four flavors should do the trick. PHOTO: Amazon Woodstock Farms Bio Medjool Dates Finkel, who recommends combining dates with nut butter or nuts, loves these special dates to nibble on. “From a nutritional perspective, having a good balance of macronutrients is key to winning the snack game,” she says. “Celery, for example, falls flat on its own, but you combine it with some peanut butter and raisins and it is instantly promoted to snack status.” The same goes for dates. So don’t be afraid to hand out two nutritionally decent snacks that, when combined, turn out to be a nutritionally outstanding snack. PHOTO: Amazon Wild Planet Wild Sockeye Salmon A major benefit of working from home is that no employee has the ability to smell what you are eating. So you can get lazy with it. According to Finkel, these salmon bags (or tuna bags) are great for breaking in at noon: The salmon contains 20 grams of protein per bag and goes wonderfully with crackers or vegetables. PHOTO: Amazon Bob’s Red Mill Classic oatmeal cups with chia and flax If you don’t have the time or the desire to create your own oatmeal mix, this is a great option, says McGrane. Each cup is packed with organic oatmeal, chia seeds, flax seeds and salt. As a result, “these oatmeal cups are filled with essential minerals and high in fiber and protein.” McGrane loves the fact that they are free of added sugars and recommends adding fresh or frozen berries for a little flavor and extra nutrition. RX Bars Variety Pack, pack of 24 RX protein bars became real fame for their list of non-BS ingredients. Each bar contains 12 grams of protein based on egg whites, dates and nuts. Keep a pair in your pocket, desk drawer, or your car as it can come in handy in an emergency with snacks. PHOTO: Amazon Manitoba Harvest Hemp Yes! bars Finkel says this is a great, handy desk snack. Made from healthy fats, energy-saving carbohydrates and 10 grams of protein, these handy bars allow you to satisfy hunger pangs and get back to the world quickly. Seapoint Farms sea salt dry roasted edamame, pack of 12 It’s so easy to have a snack with the intent of only eating a handful of something, only to come to the realization that you accidentally ingested multiple servings and suffered a stomach ache. These single-serving packs of dry-roast edamame take the guesswork out of portion control and satisfy salty cravings with the simplicity of soybean and salt. PHOTO: Amazon 88 acres of organic sunflower seed butter This brand is another nut-free option that makes snacking easier. She offers a ton of unique spreads and bars (watermelon seed butter, anyone?) That Finkel says feel gourmet. “Individually portioned snacks can be very helpful for those who feel overwhelmed with snack sizes or who take the time to put something together at home,” she adds. In addition to this individually packaged spread on which you can drizzle almost anything, yoghurt and applesauce cups, cheese sticks and bars are easy to grab and combine without much thought."
Nuance acquires Seattle digital health startup Saykara to boost healthcare AI products,2136,"Harjinder Sandhu, CEO and Founder of Saykara, speaks on the Health Tech stage at the 2018 GeekWire Summit. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Nuance Communications has acquired Saykara, a Seattle-based health tech startup that makes a voice assistant for clinicians. Based in Boston and publicly traded, Nuance will use the deal to improve its own AI-related health products. The acquisition brings well-known players together. Saykara CEO and Founder Harjinder Sandhu previously co-founded and sold healthcare startup MedRemote to Nuance in 2005. He then spent five years at Nuance, where he served as Vice President and Chief Technologist, Healthcare Research and Development was. In 2015, Sandhu got on the starting train again to start Saykara. The startup had raised $ 10 million from investors like Madrona Venture Group, SpringRock Ventures, Elevate Innovation Partners, and NewYork-Presbyterian Ventures. It employs around 30 people. Saykara’s voice assistant Kara is similar to other consumer-facing assistants like Alexa and Siri, but was built for the doctor’s office. It can automatically document an entire doctor-patient conversation without interruption. The idea is to save doctors time and energy. A 2018 survey by Stanford Medicine and Harris Poll found that 71% of doctors say documenting medical records is a major contributor to burnout. “I welcome the opportunity to return to the leader in conversational AI and clinical ambient intelligence and to the formidable Nuance research and development team – especially at this critical point in the development and adoption of these AI-powered innovations in healthcare.” Sandhu said in a statement. The adoption of digital health services and products has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic. According to MobiHealthNews, there was a record 64 digital health acquisitions in the past year. Funding for digital health startups also hit new highs. Sandhu and Saykara’s team will join Nuance’s research and development group. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. We have contacted Nuance for more details and will update this post as soon as we hear something."

"Biden to survey damage in New York, New Jersey",7537,"President Joe Biden announced on Saturday that he would travel to Manville, New Jersey and Queens, New York on Tuesday to investigate the disastrous effects of Hurricane Ida and its remains. The nation now learns about the more than 60 people killed by the storm. Many of the victims drowned in cars or were swept away by floods. Connecticut State Police Sgt. Brian Mohl was among those who died in floods caused by the remains of Hurricane Ida. Several nursing home residents died after being evacuated to a Louisiana warehouse. A 31-year-old New Jersey resident was killed when washed into a 36-inch storm sewer. At least 25 people died in New Jersey, the highest death toll in any state. Most drowned in their vehicles. A family of three was killed when water leaked into their home in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In New York City, 11 people died when their low-lying apartments were flooded with rainwater. Among them were a man, a woman and a 2 year old boy in Queens. Of the six apartments that drowned people in New York City, five were illegal basement apartments, officials said Friday. At least 50 people died in the northeast from Virginia to Connecticut. At least 14 people were killed in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Several deaths have also been attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly running backup generators. A way of heartache, of horror:Fall into a hole in the ground. Swimming in houses to stay alive. September 3:3 policemen cling to trees for hours after being stranded by the Ida flood Hundreds of thousands in the south were still without power as storm clearance efforts continued. The Louisiana Department of Health on Saturday ordered the immediate closure of seven nursing homes that were evacuating their residents to a camp facility. Seven residents died, five of whom were related to the storm. “The lack of consideration for the well-being of these vulnerable residents is a violation of human dignity. We have lost confidence in these nursing homes to provide adequate care for their residents, ”said Dr. Joseph Kanter, Louisiana State Health Commissioner, in a press release. In New York, the subways started on Friday, but train connections north of the city stopped due to mud-covered tracks. Transportation services in the Hudson Valley were not expected to be restored until early next week. Firefighters struggled to reach fires in flooded homes and businesses in the northeast, likely caused by gas leaks. The New Jersey banquet room owner watched his business go up in flames on Friday. And the police were traveling door to door looking for victims as the death toll rose. The carnage comes days after Ida, one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US mainland, was wrenched ashore in Louisiana before crashing into the northeast on Wednesday and Thursday. Currently, Ida is the deadliest hurricane in the United States in four years and the deadliest storm in the Northeast since catastrophic superstorm Sandy in 2012, which killed more than 100 people. Illegal basement apartments are re-examined after Ida’s aftermath. “We have an illegal basement problem,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Friday, adding that many residents of these apartments are afraid to speak about the conditions because they could be evicted. Illegally converted apartments often have no escape route for emergencies, poor ventilation and improper electrical work, which can pose additional hazards in extreme weather events, according to the city’s housing maintenance and development office. He said the city will put in place a cell phone warning system or door-to-door evacuations for residents of basement apartments, adding that officials would work with community organizations to reach out to residents at risk. But first the city has to set up a database of these apartments. New York attorney general Letitia James issued a statement Friday calling on the city to provide New Yorkers with special emergency housing vouchers in illegal basement apartments. She also encouraged regular visits to these apartments. At a press conference on Friday, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell encouraged evacuated residents to return home as power is expected to be restored next week. Cantell said returning residents could take in neighbors and family members who are still without electricity to support ongoing relief efforts. The city would provide transportation for those in need of public accommodation starting Saturday, Cantell added. Much of the city was still in the dark on Friday, but according to a Friday statement from Entergy, the company that supplies power to much of southeast Louisiana, power is expected to return to most of New Orleans by Wednesday. Outside of the city, the hardest-hit parts of the state were left without electricity and running water, and with limited cell phone and gasoline service, almost a week after Ida’s arrival in Louisiana. Entergy estimates full power restoration for some parts of Louisiana by September 29 or even longer after Ida damaged or destroyed an “astonishing” 22,000 utility poles, Entergy President and CEO Phillip May said, adding Number is more than Hurricanes Katrina, Zeta and Delta combined. “The extent of the devastation makes it quite difficult or almost impossible to get into some places and fully assess them,” May said. According to the Public Service Commission, about 36% of utility customers across the country – more than 800,000 homes and businesses – were without power as of Friday night. But when the storm hit on Sunday, 1.1 million were without power. Entergy says the crews have restored electricity to around 225,000 customers since Ida landed. Several fallen power lines blocking the lower Mississippi were also removed on Saturday, allowing the waterway to reopen to all traffic in New Orleans and major ports in southeast Louisiana. But the Coast Guard warned seafarers of storm debris and other dangers. Survivors struggle with the damage left behind The cleanup continued on Saturday as crews hauled debris and wet vehicles, pumped flooded homes and drained flooded highways. Meanwhile, families looked for loved ones lost in the storm, examined damage to their homes, and took photos for insurance claims. Others pumped water from their flooded basements and cleared fallen trees. For many of them it was the first time that they rated what they had lost to the murky water. The floor of Gabriella Castillo Natoli’s apartment in Yonkers, a town in Westchester County, New York, feels soft and bows in an unsettling way when she walks on it. Mud and mountains of ruined belongings are scattered. Castillo Natoli and her husband climbed onto her bed through her bedroom window, “and then I saw everything was floating like the Titanic,” she said. They grabbed what they could and went to their mother’s house. Along their street lay piles of water-soaked objects that had been dragged out of houses by floods. Chris Minetos lived down the street with his wife and baby. “It will take months to fix it,” said Minetos, examining the damage to his home. In the nine years he has lived there, he has never seen floods as bad as this. “That was scary,” said Minetos.

"Covid-19 News: Live Updates on Variants, Vaccines and Booster Shots",23672,"Sept. 4, 2021Updated  Sept. 4, 2021, 4:14 p.m. ET Sept. 4, 2021, 4:14 p.m. ETHighly concentrated veterinary ivermectin has been flying off the shelves of U.S. supply stores, despite its dangers to humans.Credit…Denis Farrell/Associated Press A doctor in rural Oklahoma says hospitals are backed up with patients who have overdosed on veterinary ivermectin, an anti-parasite medication. Mississippi’s health department said that 70 percent of recent calls to the state poison control center in August came from people who ingested ivermectin from livestock supply stores. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a person had an “altered mental status” after apparently taking five pills of ivermectin — that he had purchased on the internet — daily for five days. Another person drank an ivermectin formula intended for cattle and was hospitalized for nine days with tremors and hallucinations. Three inmates in a jail in northwest Arkansas told The Associated Press that they were unknowingly given ivermectin among their Covid medications. The C.D.C. reported almost 90,000 prescriptions per week in mid-August, up from a prepandemic average of 3,600 per week. Veterinary supply store shelves have been emptied of ivermectin. Public health warnings against using the drug as a treatment for Covid-19, especially not in the large doses crafted for livestock, appear to have made little dent in its surging popularity in the United States — or in the minds of its defenders in the conservative and fringe right-wing media sphere. The podcasting giant Joe Rogan listed ivermectin this week among the treatments he was given after contracting the virus. The conspiracy-monger Alex Jones, who has been banned from Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, took out a box of ivermectin pills during one of his trademark rants and popped two tablets live on the show he still manages to stream. Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, a nonprofit group of doctors, promotes ivermectin as a “a core medication in the prevention and treatment” of Covid-19. Ivermectin was introduced as a veterinary drug in the late 1970s, and then approved for use in humans infected with parasites. Since 1987, its U.S. maker, Merck & Co., has donated billions of doses that have spared hundreds of millions of people from river blindness in Africa and other parasitic diseases. Two scientists shared a Nobel Prize in 2015 for their work in developing the drug. But in the United States, it has limited human applications, like treating lice and rosacea, and has been primarily used to deworm horses, cows and pets — until now. On Twitter last month, the Food and Drug Administration warned that the drug was not approved for use against Covid and that taking large doses could cause serious harm. “You are not a horse,” its tweet read. “You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it.” In a statement on Wednesday, alarmed health experts from the American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists called for “an immediate end to the prescribing, dispensing and use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 outside of a clinical trial.” Though it has not been shown to be effective in treating Covid-19, people are still clamoring to get the drug, trading tips in Facebook groups and on Reddit. Some physicians have compared the phenomenon with last year’s surge of interest in hydroxychloroquine, though ivermectin has undergone more clinical trials, which have so far repeatedly shown that it failed to help Covid patients. One of the largest trials, called the Together Trial, was halted last month because the drug had been shown to be no better than a placebo at preventing hospitalization. In July, a research paper showing that the medicine reduced Covid deaths was withdrawn after questions arose about plagiarism and data manipulation.

As of Friday, 34 of the state’s 171 school districts had at some point closed because of coronavirus outbreaks and quarantines.  Credit…Amira Karaoud/Reuters About a fifth of Kentucky’s school districts have had to temporarily close since classes began last month because of coronavirus infections, an indication of the dire impact the most recent wave of the virus has had on the state. Kentucky has recently reached its highest levels of cases and hospitalizations since the start of the pandemic, largely because of the highly infectious Delta variant. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed, and Governor Andy Beshear said on Thursday he was deploying the National Guard to help medical professionals. The rise in cases has also affected Kentucky’s schoolchildren, hundreds of thousands of whom are under 12 and so not eligible for vaccination. “More kids are getting Covid right now than we ever thought imaginable,” Mr. Beshear said at a news conference on Monday. As of Friday, 34 of the state’s 171 school districts had closed at some point during the new school year because of infections and quarantines, said Josh Shoulta, a spokesman for the Kentucky School Boards Association. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized returning to in-person classes, ideally with as many people as possible vaccinated and measures like universal masking in place. But those measures have become politically fraught. On Friday, anti-mask protesters demonstrating against Washington State’s mask mandate in schools forced several to close in the southern city of Vancouver (named for the same 18th century British sea captain as the younger but much larger city in Canada). Many states are in the midst of their worst wave of the pandemic since last winter, and children are very much a part of it. According to data collected by the American Academy of Pediatrics the number of cases in children increased exponentially, up from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22 to nearly 204,000 for the last full week in August. Pediatric Covid hospitalizations are soaring. In August, Governor Beshear, a Democrat, rescinded an executive order mandating masks in schools after the state Supreme Court upheld laws passed by the Republican-led state Legislature limiting his power. However, Kentucky’s Department of Education has a mask requirement in place for public schools, in line with federal recommendations intended to make the resumption of in-person schooling as safe as possible. Toni Konz Tatman, an Education Department spokesman, said that the mask rule appeared to make a difference based on the experience of some districts. “We had a couple districts that opened before the regulation was passed and their number of quarantines was significantly higher,” she said. Reopening schools has also been complicated by a shortage of personnel, especially substitute teachers and bus drivers, that was greatly worsened by rampant coronavirus infections and quarantines, Ms. Tatman said. “Our districts are pulling in all the people they can, they really are exhausting every possibility they can, but when it gets to the point where they can’t pull it off they are closing,” she said. For now, the hope of normalcy that many educators and parents had entertained has not come to pass, she said. “I think a lot of people were hopeful that we could start the year differently,” Ms. Tatman said. “It’s just not the case.” Read moreLane Kiffin on campus in Oxford, Miss., last month.Credit…Rogelio V. Solis/Associated Press Lane Kiffin, the head football coach at the University of Mississippi, said Saturday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and would miss Monday night’s game against the University of Louisville, the season opener for both. Every player and coach in the Mississippi football program is fully vaccinated — a point of pride for Mr. Kiffin, 46, in recent weeks — and the coach said in a statement on Saturday that he was “experiencing only mild symptoms.” He said no players were expected to miss Monday’s game, which will be played at a neutral site in Atlanta, and that no one else in the football program had tested positive. “We will continue to monitor our team closely and take responsible measures if any symptoms arise,” he said. In an interview last month, Mr. Kiffin said he and other members of the coaching staff at the university, along with some outside doctors, had spoken with players to try to ease any misgivings they might have about becoming fully vaccinated. The successful effort at Mississippi, one of just a handful of major college programs with 100 percent vaccination rates, was the envy of other schools, including in the Southeastern Conference. “Football is competitive, coaching is competitive, the SEC is as competitive as you get, including in pro sports,” Mr. Kiffin said on Aug. 23. “This is probably the first thing where it was like, ‘OK, hey, we did this,’ and people are calling us for advice — other coaches, other trainers — and we’re openly sharing that.” But Mr. Kiffin lives and coaches in a state that has struggled mightily with the virus. Less than half of those eligible for shots in Mississippi are fully vaccinated, and in recent weeks, the state posted daily records for new cases and saw its health care system buckle. Since Aug. 14, average Covid hospitalizations have surpassed the highest previous level of 1,547, reached just over a year ago. And Mr. Kiffin is far from the first college coach to test positive and be forced to miss a game. Last year, Nick Saban, the University of Alabama’s coach, missed a rivalry game against Auburn University, and Ryan Day of Ohio State University was absent for a game against Michigan State University. Mr. Kiffin, one of the sport’s sharpest offensive minds, is entering his second season as the head coach at Mississippi. The Rebels posted a 5-5 record last season. Read moreTwo-month-old Carvase Perrilloux Jr. in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Children’s Hospital in New Orleans last month.Credit…Erin Schaff/The New York Times Pediatric hospitalizations for Covid-19 have soared over the summer as the highly contagious Delta variant spread across the country, according to two new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From late June to mid-August, hospitalization rates in the United States for children and teenagers increased nearly fivefold, although they remain slightly below January’s peak, one new study found. But vaccination has made a difference. During this summer’s wave, the hospitalization rate was 10 times as high in unvaccinated adolescents as in those who were vaccinated, researchers found. Pediatric hospital admissions were nearly four times as high in states with the lowest vaccination rates as in those with the highest rates, according to a second study. The studies, released on Friday, do not provide clear answers about whether Delta causes more severe disease in children than earlier versions of the virus. The rise in pediatric hospitalizations could also be because of the variant’s high infectiousness. Indeed, one study concluded that the proportion of hospitalized children with severe disease had not changed in late June and July, when the Delta variant became dominant in the United States. The rates reported in the C.D.C. studies are based on data from two national surveillance systems, including hospitals in 49 states and Washington, D.C. In one C.D.C. study, researchers found that since July, when the Delta variant became predominant, the rate of new coronavirus cases increased for children 17 or younger, as did Covid-related emergency room visits and hospital admissions. “We saw that E.R. visits, cases and hospital admissions are rising,” said Dr. David Siegel, lieutenant commander in the U.S. Public Health Service and the lead author of the paper. “It could be that Delta is more severe or that Delta is more transmissible, and it could be related to other factors such as masking.” The study also found that Covid-related emergency room visits and hospital admissions among children were more than three times as high in states with the lowest vaccination coverage compared with states with high vaccination rates, underscoring the importance of communitywide vaccination to protect children. Other important factors that might affect regional differences included masking and social distancing measures, the study noted. Last month, as Delta surged, the incidence of Covid in children rose from earlier in the summer — reaching 16.2 cases per 100,000 children ages 4 or under; 28.5 cases per 100,000 children ages 5 to 11; and 32.7 cases per 100,000 children ages 12 through 17. That rate represented a sharp spike from a June low of 1.7 per 100,000 children ages 4 or under; 1.9 cases per 100,000 children ages 5 to 11; and 2.9 per 100,000 children between ages 12 and 17. It was still below the peak incidence of cases among children last January. The proportion of Covid patients under 17 who were admitted to intensive care units ranged from 10 to 25 percent from August 2020 through last June, and hovered at 20 percent by July 2021, according to the C.D.C. study. In a second study, researchers analyzed data from the Covid-Net surveillance network, which includes information on hospitalizations in 99 counties across 14 states. Over the course of the pandemic — or from March 1, 2020, to Aug. 14, 2021 — there were 49.7 Covid-related hospitalizations per 100,000 children and adolescents, the researchers found. But the weekly rates have been climbing since July. During the week ending Aug. 14, there were 1.4 Covid-related hospitalizations for every 100,000 children, compared with 0.3 in late June and early July. (That remains slightly below the peak weekly rate of 1.5 hospitalizations per 100,000 children, in early January 2021, in the post-holiday wave of cases.) Hospitalization rates have increased most sharply for children who are 4 or younger. In the week ending Aug. 14, there were 1.9 hospitalizations per 100,000 children in that age group, nearly 10 times as many as in late June. But based on the limited data available so far, it does not appear that the Delta variant is affecting the incidence of severe disease or deaths among children, which have been somewhat steady and relatively low throughout the pandemic. Among the children and adolescents hospitalized from June 20 to July 31, 23.2 percent were admitted to the I.C.U., 9.8 percent required mechanical ventilation and 1.8 percent died. Those figures were roughly the same as those for children who were hospitalized before the Delta variant became widespread. Read moreEthan Burrell, 20, said he was happy to be vaccinated so that he could return to campus at St. John’s University in Queens, N.Y.Credit…Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times Universities in New York were among some of the first institutions in the nation to require vaccinations, some as early as in the spring, long before city agencies or many private companies did so. At the time, it was unclear how the general public would respond to such orders. Now, as many of these colleges begin classes in the midst of an uptick in Covid-19 cases, in part because of the Delta variant, schools are reporting that few of the controversies and protests that have sprung up in response to vaccine mandates in the workplace have been seen on New York’s college campuses. “The same kind of division we’re seeing in the country, we’re not seeing in the college population,” said Arthur Caplan, a New York University bioethicist who studies vaccine hesitancy in young people. More than 100 New York colleges have a mandate in place, according to a tracker from The Chronicle of Higher Education. Many said that more than 80 percent of their student bodies had been partially or fully vaccinated as of mid-August. “Mostly, students just want to be back,” said Jim Malatras, chancellor for the State University of New York system. He added: “The enthusiasm and energy is actually palpable on campus. I sense it in a way I’ve never sensed it before.” Travelers at Union Station on Friday in Washington, D.C., as Labor Day weekend began. Credit…Alex Wong/Getty Images Though the three-day Labor Day weekend typically signifies the unofficial end of summer and the last chance for many people to travel, health officials are trying to rein in that ritual this year as the highly contagious Delta variant fuels a rise in hospitalizations. Unvaccinated people should avoid traveling over the holiday weekend, said Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She identified vaccination and masking as key factors in preventing the spread of the virus. “Throughout the pandemic, we have seen that the vast majority of transmission takes place among unvaccinated people in closed, indoor settings,” Dr. Walensky said. However, the Transportation Security Administration reported that the number of travelers passing through its airport checkpoints on Thursday and Friday nearly equaled prepandemic levels. On Thursday, the agency logged 1,896,846 checks, about 90 percent of the 2019 number, and on Friday it reported 2,129,999 checks, about 97 percent of the 2019 level.

Mr. De La Hoya, 48, posted videos on Instagram and Twitter on Friday of himself in a hospital bed in Los Angeles. He says in Spanish to the camera that had been diagnosed with Covid-19 even though he was fully vaccinated. “Me siento mal, mal, mal, mal, tengo Covid, mi pecho no — no puedo respirar bien.” “I feel bad, bad, bad, bad, I have Covid, my chest doesn’t — I can’t breathe well.” The boxer, who retired with a 39-6 professional record and won numerous world titles, hasn’t fought in a professional boxing match since he lost to Manny Pacquiao in 2008. Mr. De La Hoya had been training in recent months for an match against Vitor Belfort, a former UFC champion, on Sept. 11 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. In recent years, Mr. De La Hoya, whose nickname was “Golden Boy,” has worked as a boxing promoter and last year helped push to bring boxing back during the pandemic, even if it meant there would be no fans in the arena. He will be replaced in the fight by Evander Holyfield, ESPN reported. Masha Crawford, a nurse, tends to a patient on dialysis at Providence St. John’s Health Center in Los Angeles. People hospitalized with Covid-19 are at greater risk of kidney damage, a new study finds.Credit…Isadora Kosofsky for The New York Times Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors have found that people who become very ill with Covid-19 often experience kidney problems, not just the lung impairments that are the hallmark of the illness. Now, a large study suggests that kidney issues can last for months after patients recover from the initial infection, and may lead to a serious lifelong reduction of kidney function in some patients. The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, found that the sicker Covid patients were initially, the more likely they were to experience lingering kidney damage. But even people with less severe initial infections could be vulnerable. “You see really, across the board, a higher risk of a bunch of important kidney-associated events,” said Dr. F. Perry Wilson, a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Yale, who was not involved in the study. “And what was particularly striking to me was that these persisted.” Kidneys play a vital role in the body, clearing toxins and excess fluid from the blood, helping maintain a healthy blood pressure, and keeping a balance of electrolytes and other important substances. When the kidneys are not working properly or efficiently, fluids build up, leading to swelling, high blood pressure, weakened bones and other problems. The heart, lungs, central nervous system and immune system can become impaired. In end-stage kidney disease, dialysis or an organ transplant may become necessary. The condition can be fatal. The new study, based on records of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, analyzed data from 89,216 people who tested positive for the coronavirus between March 1, 2020, and March 15, 2021, as well as data from 1,637,467 people who were not Covid patients. Between one and six months after becoming infected, Covid survivors were about 35 percent more likely than non-Covid patients to have kidney damage or substantial declines in kidney function, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the V.A. St. Louis Health Care System and senior author of the study. Read moreClinicians suiting up at a free Covid-19 testing site in Oakland, Calif. Fewer Covid-related medical services will be free in the future.Credit…Jim Wilson/The New York Times Americans will most likely pay significantly more for Covid medical care during this new wave of cases — whether that’s a routine test or a lengthy hospitalization. Earlier in the pandemic, most major health insurers voluntarily waived costs associated with Covid treatment. Patients weren’t responsible for co-pays or deductibles for emergency room visits or hospital stays, and most tests were free, too. But now, insurers are treating Covid more like other conditions, no longer fully covering the costs of care. The federal rules that make coronavirus testing free include exemptions for routine workplace and school testing, which has become more common. Some patients have already received bills as high as $200 for routine screenings, according to documents patients submitted to a New York Times project tracking the costs of Covid testing and treatment. If you’ve received a bill, you can submit it here. Some of the highest bills will probably involve Covid patients who need extensive hospital care now that 72 percent of large health plans are no longer offering free Covid treatment, a recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found. This includes Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, the largest health plan in a state experiencing one of the country’s worst outbreaks. “When the Covid-19 pandemic began last year, we implemented several emergency provisions to temporarily help our members,” Toni Woods, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. She said the plan was now focused on encouraging vaccinations. Oscar Health, which sells coverage in Florida and 14 other states, also ended free Covid treatment this week. It cited the widespread availability of the vaccine as a key reason. Jackie Khan, an Oscar spokeswoman, said, “We believe that the Covid vaccine is our best way to beat this pandemic, and we are committed to covering it and testing at $0 for our members.” The new policies generally apply to all patients, including the vaccinated, people who get sick with a breakthrough infection, and children under 12, who are not yet eligible for the vaccine. Dr. Kao-Ping Chua, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan who researches Covid care costs, said, “If you have a small kid who gets Covid at school and ends up at the I.C.U., that family is going to now be stuck with the bill even though that patient did not have the ability to get vaccinated.” Read more"
Best thermometers of 2021 | CNN Underscored,32287,"
CNN
—   As mercury thermometers are a thing of the past, you no longer have to wait several minutes to read a small red line. Instead, there are now five different types of thermometers — rectal, oral, axillary (armpit), temporal (forehead) and tympanic (remote ear) — that can display a reading in seconds on a digital display. Many also offer helpful features like color-coded backgrounds and fever indicators, a log of historical readings and the ability to read surface temperatures, such as a baby’s bottle. To gain some insights on thermometers, we spoke to two medical experts. They explained that, while readings may differ a degree or two depending on whether you’re using an oral or a forehead thermometer, all types can aptly alert you to the presence of a fever. So, aside from toddlers under 3 years old (for whom a rectal thermometer is best), it all comes down to personal preference. (You can read their full insights below.) In our search for the best thermometers, CNN Underscored tested 15 of the most highly rated options. All thermometers were tested on the same person several times to check for accuracy and consistency. Aside from evaluating the readings, we also considered ease of use, speed of readings and any other nice-to-have options. After weeks of testing, we found three thermometers that should have a place in every medicine cabinet: Best thermometer overall This thermometer can be held up to 2 inches away, and there’s a positioning sensor that shines a light on your forehead to ensure you’re on the right point of the head when taking temperature. With an option to silence any noise and an LED display that can be seen in the dark, the Braun No-Touch thermometer offers everything you need — plus some — in a thermometer. Best thermometer for travel The Elepho eTherm Infrared Ear & Forehead Thermometer, while not as slim as the oral/rectal/axillary thermometers, is the smallest, most durable on-the-go thermometer you’ll find that doesn’t require you to also pack probe covers. You also have two options to take temperature reading: in the ear canal or on the forehead. Best affordable thermometer The Vicks ComfortFlex Digital Thermometer boasts a large reading display with a backlight and has three different color-coded indicators. Though readouts took longer than the no-touch options, for a small (and cheap) thermometer, this one is a solid option. Jennifer Yellin/CNN Braun Digital No-Touch Forehead Thermometer The Braun Digital No-Touch Forehead Thermometer was by far the best we tested. This thermometer guides you through the entire temperature-taking process with directions conveniently printed right on the front of the thermometer. Our medical experts emphasized the importance of following directions for any particular thermometer used since they all work a little differently. When taking the temperature, a light casts from the thermometer to your forehead to ensure you are pointing it on the right part of your forehead (you can read more about thermometer placement below). If you’re too far away, it’ll tell you to move forward by displaying “FWD” on the large reading display, a function unique to this thermometer. This capability allowed us to receive both accurate and consistent results when we tested our own forehead temperature — our results ranged between 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit. While many other thermometers we tested also gave us similarly consistent results (though some did vary between each reading by up to 2 degrees), this one made us feel more confident that we were in fact receiving an accurate reading due to the positioning light, never worrying we were taking temperature readings too far from or in the wrong place on the forehead. The Braun No-Touch also works by holding it directly on the forehead, which might be easier if you’re taking your own temperature. This is not an option available on many other no-touch thermometers. If you need to take the temperatures of multiple people, the no-touch option will reduce cross-contamination and lessen the risk of spreading germs. Temperatures were easy to read on this thermometer, thanks to a backlit color-coded screen that displays three different colors based on the temperature reading — green for a normal reading, yellow for a slightly elevated fever and red for a high fever. This quick indicator can be useful if you’re taking mass readings one right after another — for example, as children walk into their preschool — to quickly see if anyone is running a fever. The light-up display is also useful for taking a child’s temperature in a dark bedroom while they’re sleeping; you can silence the thermometer with a switch on the side as well so there’s no beeping sound that might wake them up. The thermometer comes with a protective cap to keep the display and probe clean and offers a three-year warranty, which is significantly longer than most others we tested. You’ll also be notified when the battery life has 20% left with a flashing battery symbol. One issue with this thermometer is there’s no memory function to display past readings, something we found helpful with other thermometers. If you want something that will keep track of your readings, this is probably not the thermometer for you, as there are many that have this functionality (the iProven No-Touch Thermometer being another favorite of ours). While this thermometer costs more than most we tested, you’re getting a thermometer that’s easy to use, offers the easiest directions to follow and will give you some of the most accurate and consistent readings — and is both the best forehead and non-contact thermometer we tested. Jennifer Yellin/CNN Elepho eTherm Infrared Ear & Forehead Thermometer Looking to get out of town but want to ensure that a thermometer is packed? If so, the Elepho eTherm Infrared Ear & Forehead Thermometer is the top choice. With lots of functionality and a slim design, this thermometer can easily slide into a toiletry bag or purse. We found the thermometer incredibly easy to move across the forehead, and it felt better than some of the other forehead thermometers that go against your skin, some of which felt a little too rigid and hard. When we tested against a 4-year-old’s forehead, he concurred that this one was smooth and in fact actually felt “nice.” He even asked for his temperature to be taken with the Elepho eTherm over and over again, just for fun. This thermometer can also be used in the ear canal, and was only one of three thermometers we tested that offers both forehead and ear canal reading. (And since it was one of the few that did not require probe covers, it was one of the best ear thermometers we tested.) Of those, the Elepho eTherm gave us significantly better readings than the other two. With the forehead readings, we received consistent and accurate results ranging between 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit — which is right within normal range for the forehead. It’s also similar to what we received with our top pick overall. Our ear canal readings were also within normal range, but also slightly lower: between 98 degrees Fahrenheit and 98.24 degrees Fahrenheit. There’s a large LED display, which can be seen in the dark, and instead of a color-coded backlight, you’re notified of a fever via a beep. One beep indicates a normal temperature, two beeps if slightly elevated and four beeps if you’re showing a fever. We preferred the color-coded system featured on the Braun over beeps — especially if you have a sleeping child — but the beeps were also effective. One component we really liked about this thermometer is that it automatically shuts off after eight seconds. This will save your battery, which is important if you’re using the thermometer on the go. It also passed our durability test with flying colors, with no breakage when dropped against our hardware floor. With its slim and durable design, this thermometer is the perfect choice to throw in your bag on your next trip — especially since you don’t have to worry about probe covers, the batteries draining or it breaking. Jennifer Yellin/CNN Vicks Comfort Digital Thermometer Although the Vicks ComfortFlex Digital Thermometer is one of the least expensive devices on the list, it still provides solid functionality, even some that you might not get with more expensive thermometers. This thermometer allows you to take your temperature readings three different ways — orally, rectally or under the armpit. First, we tested our temperature orally — with and without probe covers (disposable casings that go over the thermometer tip to keep the device sanitary), and we received similar readings between 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit with each method. That wasn’t the case with all of the oral thermometers we tested — such as the Femometer Infrared Thermometer, which had up to a 1.64 degree Fahrenheit difference with and without probe covers — making this thermometer much more desirable. This positive result told us that even if you don’t have probe covers easily accessible, you’ll still receive consistent readings. If you aren’t able to use probe covers, you can easily wash the tip of the thermometer with soap and water or rubbing alcohol. Fortunately, five single-use probe covers come in the box to get you started, and it’s about $5 to order another 200 covers, keeping it squarely in the budget-conscious category. We took our temperature under the armpit and received a slightly lower reading, averaging 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Although lower, this is expected when taking a temperature with this method. As the directions state, taking your temperature under the armpit “produces a temperature 1 degree Fahrenheit lower than a temperature taken orally.” We also consulted with the medical experts and learned the reason behind this: The axillary (armpit) is taken outside of the body (versus inside), so you’re taking the temperature of your skin versus your core. That’s why, when taking your temperature under the armpit, you’ll want to add approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit to your reading to determine whether or not you have a real fever. (Note: We did not test the thermometer’s rectal reading, so we cannot specifically speak to this thermometer’s accuracy in that realm.) We saw about a 14-second average recording time for taking temperatures with this thermometer. While this is a shorter time frame than some of the other oral thermometers we tested (which fell anywhere between 10 and 25 seconds), 14 seconds can feel like an eternity for kids. Comparatively, most of the ear and forehead thermometers will take just a second for the reading to appear. And even though we’re only talking about a difference of a few seconds, during our testing, both a 4- and 7-year-old found the forehead preferable to oral, so it’s something to consider if you have young kids. Despite the small size of the thermometer, you’ll find a large display with a backlight that shows three different colors based on the temperature — green means no fever is present, yellow is 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit and above, and red is for fevers 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit and above — so you can quickly identify where your temperature falls. Simply put, this was was the best oral thermometer and best thermometer for babies (where a rectal temperature is recommended) of all those we tested. We interviewed two medical experts — Michael Elkort, M.D., pediatrics at Newton Wellesley, and Jacqueline Jossen, M.D., assistant professor of pediatrics gastroenterology at Columbia University — to gain a better understanding of thermometers and how they work. Types of thermometers We tested five different types of thermometers: rectal, oral, axillary (armpit), temporal (forehead) and tympanic (remote ear). While individuals may have a preference for one type over another, we spoke to a medical expert to understand which type is in fact the best for which circumstance. Dr. Elkort emphasized the importance of using the proper thermometer for different ages — especially when taking the temperature of a child. He said that for those younger than 3 years old, rectal thermometers are always the best since this records an internal temperature (versus the forehead). Babies and toddlers have ear canals that are too small for an ear thermometer and getting an accurate reading orally is challenging (and it’s not recommended to put a thermometer in a baby’s mouth). With a rectal thermometer, there’s simply less room for error. Clinical decisions rest on the thermometer reading, so it is important that the reading is accurate. For all children over 3 years old, he recommends using the following — in the order listed — for accuracy: oral, armpit, forehead and ear. Although Dr. Elkort does not recommend forehead or ear thermometers for children since they can give you a wide range of readings if you in fact have a fever, they are accurate in alerting you if a fever is present and are still very reliable at measuring normal body temperatures. This makes forehead and ear thermometers good for quickly and easily checking for the presence of a fever when the actual number measurement isn’t important. Dr. Elkort also suggests that these thermometers work best when taking the temperature for a large group of people, as these thermometers work quickly with minimal concern for cross-contamination. Additionally, when taking your temperature as a precautionary measure, you simply just need to know whether or not there is a fever present — the actual temperature reading isn’t as important. How to determine a fever Normal body temperature is said to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. However, some individuals run high or low, so figuring out your own normal body temperature is important. Before you take your temperature when feeling ill, you should determine your normal body temperature with that same thermometer — since many thermometer readings have a slight margin — so you compare the reading against a predetermined baseline for normal. You can also refer to the American Academy of Pediatrics’s guidelines for taking children’s temperatures. For example, if you typically have a 97.8-degree temperature with a certain thermometer, you might be more concerned when it gives you a 100.8-degree reading than if your normal temperature is 99.1. According to CNN Health’s reporting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a person to have a fever when his or her temperature is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or greater. This is why your doctor will ask you the method by which you took your or your child’s temperature, as they will many times add or subtract a degree to determine if the temperature reading is concerning. Accuracy Dr. Jossen gave us some tips to help ensure accurate readings. First: Be consistent with where you’re taking your measurement. Temperatures taken from different parts of the body may not be comparable. For instance, there are natural variations between your right and left ears, and temperatures measured in the armpit (as done with infants) are less accurate. Second: Make sure (with all thermometers) to position them correctly. This is especially important with no-touch thermometers to ensure you’re holding the device the appropriate distance from clean, unobstructed skin. Dr. Jossen emphasizes the importance of always referring to the manufacturer’s instructions for any particular thermometer. Lastly: Oral thermometers should not be used shortly after drinking something hot or cold, as that can skew readings. Give it at least 15 minutes. After scouring editorial and user reviews, we picked 15 of the most highly reviewed thermometers to put to the test. We completed multiple readings for each thermometer (within the same time frame) to determine consistency and then compared those readings to the readings of every other thermometer. We also analyzed everything you’d want in a thermometer, including usability right out of the box (and after reading the directions), the display options, the speed of getting your temperature taken and any indicator to let you know if you have a fever. Here’s how we evaluated each thermometer to find our winners: Performance Build Warranty iProven No-Touch Thermometer ($29.49; amazon.com) If you want a thermometer for every member in your family to use, then the iProven No-Touch Thermometer fits the bill — plus more. It was even tested by a 4- and 7-year-old without issue. And with a large number display, reading the temperature recording can be done by anyone — even a child. In fact, this thermometer is very comparable to our best overall, the Braun Digital No-Touch Forehead Thermometer, but it doesn’t offer the same positioning light. However, if memory functionality is important to you, the iProven will store an impressive 50 readings, whereas the Braun doesn’t offer any storage capability. This eliminates having to write down readings — with the possibility of losing that scrap piece of paper — and having all temperatures readily available when speaking to a doctor. It’ll also help you determine whether or not your fever is going up or down over time. Since this is a no-touch thermometer, it reads from the forehead with no physical contact required. This helps keep the thermometer clean and avoids spreading germs from one person to another. This thermometer also measures room, objects and liquid temperatures — something the Braun Digital No-Touch Forehead Thermometer doesn’t offer. Overall, though, the forehead guides and distance measurement on the Braun were features we found more helpful in everyday use, thus securing its place atop the field. Amazon iHealth No Touch Forehead Thermometer iHealth No-Touch Forehead Thermometer ($24.99; amazon.com) This no-touch forehead thermometer has a very similar look and feel as one of our favorites, the Elepho eTherm Infrared Ear & Forehead Thermometer, although it doesn’t offer an ear recording option. The thermometer is sleek and slim in design, and much smaller than some of the other no-touch forehead options. The thermometer is extremely easy to use right out of the box, and there’s a one-page guide with directions to understand the basics. This thermometer includes a built-in infrared temperature sensor, which collects more than 100 data points per second. This technology allows for extremely consistent readings, and out of the four readings, three were exactly the same, while one was just 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit lower. To use this thermometer, you’ll put it an inch away from the center of a person’s forehead and within one second you’ll receive the reading. Once the temperature is recorded, the thermometer vibrates to indicate it’s complete. We liked this better than a beep, as it avoids annoying sounds, but it still gives you a message that the temperature recording is complete. There’s a large LED display, which can easily be seen in the dark. Unlike many of the other thermometers, there’s no color-coded backlight to indicate a fever. Now, if you want a wireless version that can track to your phone, there’s an upgraded version — at just $39.99 — where you can track up to 99 readings on your smartphone with the free iHealth app. Braun ThermoScan 5 Digital Ear Thermometer ($49.99; amazon.com) The Braun ThermoScan 5 Digital Ear Thermometer is ideal if you’re looking for an ear-only reading. The prewarmed tip helps ensure accurate readings — and our own readings confirmed that, as two of our readings were a normal 98.6-degree temperature, while the other two were just 0.1 and 0.2 degrees higher. The thermometer does require disposable probe filters, and the thermometer will not work if a filter isn’t in place. While this helps to keep the thermometer probe clean and germ-free, it does require you to always have clean filters on hand. It also creates extra plastic waste, if that’s something you’re concerned about. Fortunately, a box of filters is included so you can use the thermometer right away, but a refill 40-pack will cost you an extra $6. There’s an easy storage case for the thermometer to snap into, and the probe filter box goes right inside, so you never have to worry about losing them. At this price point, however, we would’ve liked to see a few more features, such as the capability to track more than just the last reading and a backlight to see in the dark. And while the thermometer has an on/off button — unlike most of the thermometers we tested — it does not automatically shut off for a full minute. iProven Forehead and Ear Thermometer ($24.99; walmart.com) As the name suggests, the iProven Forehead and Ear Thermometer allows you to take your temperature two ways: a swipe across your forehead or in the ear canal. Using this thermometer right out of the box was extremely easy, especially with the clearly indicated “ear” and “head” buttons. We took our temperature with both methods and found about a degree difference between the two. Our ear canal readings were more accurate — and consistent — which is exactly what we expected, since the instructions state that the ear is more of an “exact measurement” and head mode is an “indicative measurement.” We also found it easy to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit and to view the past 20 readings that were recorded. The thermometer also offers a color-coded fever indicator where the backlight will turn red if a fever is present (99.7 degrees Fahrenheit or above). The one issue with this thermometer right out of the box is that no ear probe covers come with the device. While you can use generic covers — which we tested and that work fine — having to go the extra step to purchase these covers right away isn’t always the ideal situation. And Dr. Jossen says that “if your thermometer requires a probe cover, be sure to use an appropriate cover and to replace between readings.” Exergen TemporalScanner Thermometer With SmartGlow ($49.99; walmart.com) If you’re looking for a thermometer that will provide you with the longest warranty, then the Exergen TemporalScanner Thermometer with SmartGlow is the way to go. With a 5-year warranty — when most others offer only a year — you’ll be protected with your purchase in case of malfunction. This thermometer goes straight across your forehead and is easy to use right out of the box. It’s also one of the few thermometers that includes a quick guide right on the thermometer itself with five steps to accurately take your temperature. A silent mode is available, there’s an eight-scan memory recording and you’ll have the option to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. There’s also a backlight display, with a very soft yellow glow for reading in the dark. This is helpful if you’re taking a child’s temperature while they’re sleeping, as there won’t be a large color display to potentially wake them up. On the flip side, the display is significantly smaller than most others, there aren’t any color-coded backlights to indicate a fever and the cap was hard to put on (and stay on) for kids. ThermoWorks Wand No-Touch Forehead Thermometer ($69; thermoworks.com) From the beginning, we were intrigued with the ThermoWorks Wand — especially since a delicious bag of jelly beans came in the box. It doesn’t look like any other thermometer we’ve seen before, and at such an expensive price point, we had high hopes. Right out of the box, we found the ThermoWorks Wand easy to use. But that’s where it stopped. The thermometer offers many extras, but we found getting those options to work was complex. For example, the thermometer will not only take body temperatures, but it’ll also record surface temperatures (up to 176 degrees Fahrenheit). Many other no-touch thermometers will do this as well, but figuring it out was significantly easier due to multiple labeled buttons on the device. The ThermoWorks Wand has only one button that does everything, which we found troublesome. Despite the slight difficulty, the device gives accurate and consistent readings, has the option to mute all sounds, can store up to 25 readings and offers an LED backlight. Ultimately, as the most expensive thermometer on the list — by quite a bit — we don’t believe it’s worth the extra money. iProven Thermometer, Oral & Rectal ($14.99; amazon.com) The iProven is your standard thermometer that will take your temperature both orally and rectally. It’s small in size, easy to use and offers a few extra features, but not many. The tip is extremely soft, and we didn’t find it annoying under the tongue, but it took between 19 and 23 seconds each time for the reading to be complete — the longest out of all of the thermometers we tested. If you’re looking for a quick read or trying to take a child’s temperature, this long reading isn’t going to cut it. The thermometer also doesn’t automatically shut off until the 10-minute mark, which is almost nine minutes longer than most of the other thermometers on the list — although there’s an on/off button that you’ll want to remember to use so you don’t waste the battery. And although the iProven thermometer can be used orally or rectally, it comes with an “oral” and “rectal” sticker that you can put on the thermometer to know which body part the thermometer is dedicated for. No probe covers come with the thermometer, although we tested probe covers that came with another thermometer and they fit perfectly, if you’d like to use them for sanitary purposes. And even when using the probe covers, the readings came out the exact same. The thermometer is one of the easiest to clean, as it’s fully waterproof, meaning you can use just soap and water. It also comes with a plastic container to ensure the entire thermometer is kept clean when it’s not being used. Olganda Noncontact Infrared Thermometer ($39.99; amazon.com) The Olganda Noncontact Infrared Thermometer works exactly the same way and even has a similar look as one of our favorites, the iProven Noncontact Infrared Body, although the final rating didn’t do nearly as well. For starters, no batteries came in the box, even though it’s a requirement for the thermometer to turn on. And with two AAA batteries required, that’s not something you might just have lying around. Of course, picking up batteries at your local convenience store is easy, but if you’re sick, the last thing you want to do is have to run out. Instead, you want the opportunity to take your temperature immediately. We also didn’t receive the best readings, as they were almost a full degree less than some of our other noncontact thermometers we tested. It also didn’t stay intact for our durability test. After (purposely) dropping the thermometer on the ground, the batteries fell out and the top infrared cover popped off. Although, after putting the pieces back together, the thermometer did work just fine. With that being said, the thermometer comes in a great storage bag — something that most thermometers don’t provide — and is extremely easy to use without having to read the full directions manual. It’ll record your last 20 temperature readings, has the capability to change the fever alert threshold based on your own body temperature and offers a one-second reading. And if using a thermometer for other objects is important, this thermometer will do it for you as well. Chooseen Digital Forehead and Ear Thermometer ($24.99; amazon.com) The Chooseen Digital Forehead and Ear Thermometer unfortunately didn’t fit the bill for us. Our No. 1 priority is an accurate temperature reading, and this thermometer didn’t give that to us. The thermometer allows you to take your temperature two different ways: across the forehead and in the ear. Amongst the four readings when taken in our ear canal — which is considered to be more accurate than a forehead reading — we ranged anywhere between 96.9 degrees Fahrenheit and a 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit. So although the readings were consistent, we didn’t feel it would do the best job actually identifying a fever. On the forehead, we then again saw consistent readings, but at a 99.5-degree temperature. While the directions state that “the measured forehead temperature can fluctuate up to 1 degree Fahrenheit,” we saw a significant difference between the two, which we didn’t see with our other thermometers that have multiple reading options. Despite the accuracy issues we faced, the thermometer does include some nice-to-have features, such as the option to take nonbody measurements, including room, object and liquid temperatures. There’s an LED light for the dark, a fever warning and color-coded blacklights. You can also see up to 35 prior temperature readings, unmute sounds and easily change between Fahrenheit and Celsius. You might also be able to get this thermometer ultimately for free after your purchase. In the box, there’s an opportunity to receive a $30 Amazon gift card or a $30 refund by PayPal if you leave a review. Since the product costs only $23.99, you could even end up making money. Femometer Infrared Ear Thermometer ($19.99; amazon.com) The Femometer Infrared Ear Thermometer will instantly measure your temperature through the ear canal in a single second. The temperature comes with 10 protective covers in the box — and, while you can use the thermometer without the covers, from a sanity perspective, using the covers is recommended. We measured our temperature both with and without the covers — within the same time period — and unfortunately, our readings were quite different. When using the protective covers, we received readings between 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit. But when taking off the cover, the reading was more than a degree less, as we received between 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 98 degrees Fahrenheit. If accuracy and consistency are your main priority, then this might not be the best thermometer for you. The thermometer is also quite large and comes in a protective stand. If you’re pressed for space in your medicine cabinet, this is probably a thermometer to avoid, especially since the protective covers don’t fit in the case. Kinsa Smart Ear Digital Thermometer ($35.99; amazon.com) If you have chronic sickness that necessitates regular temperature recordings, this is the brand for you. However, if you’re looking for something a little more simplistic, the Kinsa brand might be more than what you bargained for. The Kinsa brand is unlike anything else we tested. The thermometer connects to an app and will record the time and date of every temperature reading. Prior to taking your temperature, the device will pair with your phone via Bluetooth and you’ll take your temperature in your ear canal just like any other ear thermometer. The temperature will then immediately show up in the app and you’ll indicate which family member received this particular recording. You can then also include any symptoms you have or your child has, which could be helpful when speaking to your doctor. The app will also help guide you on what to do when you have a fever, such as when to take medication and when to see a doctor. You can also set up medication reminders if needed. There are also some animations on the app to keep kids entertained while their temperature is being taken. While the app is free, you must have your smartphone on you or nearby when checking your temperature — or at least within range of a Bluetooth connection. This is of course a great concept for some, but the vast majority will most likely prefer a thermometer that’s easy to use right out of the box — without the requirement of downloading an app. Kinsa Smart Thermometer ($24.99; kinsahealth.com) The Kinsa Smart Thermometer offers the exact same app as the Kinsa Smart Ear Digital Thermometer, but it allows you to take your temperature orally, rectally or under the armpit. The thermometer comes in a plastic pouch to keep it safe and clean — and is also helpful for travel purposes. There’s a flexible tip, and readings are recorded in approximately eight seconds. Similar to the other Kinsa brand thermometer we tested, we found readings to be accurate and consistent, but the app needs to be installed first before you can take your temperature.

"Ida Latest News: N.Y. Region Deaths Rise, Six People Still Missing in N.J.",40443,"Video transcript Back transcript Look! The remnants of Hurricane Ida caused flash flooding and a number of deaths and disrupted transit across parts of New York and New Jersey.CreditCredit…Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times The death toll from the remnants of Hurricane Ida grew on Friday with the announcement of two more deaths in New Jersey, bringing the total number of lives lost to 46 across four states hit that were hit by the storm Wednesday evening. Authorities fear the toll will increase further: Gov. Phillip D. Murphy of New Jersey said at least six people were still missing in the floods. “This was a deadly and dangerous storm, and we continue to face its aftereffects,” he said at a morning news conference. The dead include 25 people in New Jersey, 16 in New York, four in Pennsylvania and one in Connecticut. In New York City, where 13 people died, most of whom were trapped in flooded basement apartments, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Friday that going forward, when flash floods were forecast, the city would go door-to-door in neighborhoods with high concentrations of such apartments and evacuate residents. New Jersey officials released a county-by-county breakdown of deaths. They were concentrated in a belt across the upper middle region of the state, with most occurring in Hunterdon County (6 deaths), Union County (5), Essex County (4) and Somerset County (4). As the region undertakes the daunting task of assessing damage, digging out and cleaning up, Mr. Murphy, speaking in Millburn, a Newark suburb whose downtown was overwhelmingly flooded, said the state would quickly make $10 million in aid available to small businesses. The aid will be distributed in grants of $1,000 to $5,000. “If you’ve been crushed and you can prove it, you’re eligible,” Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Murphy and Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York both said that they were expecting large infusions of recovery aid from the federal government once a federal disaster has been declared, something that President Biden is expected to do after his declaration Thursday night of federal emergency status for New York and New Jersey. Ms. Hochul said the state would easily surpass the $30 million threshold required for the federal government to eventually issue a so-called major disaster declaration, which would loosen a wider range of federal assistance for individuals and infrastructure projects. There are no figures yet on the extent of property damage caused by the storm, which dumped half a foot of water in just a few hours across parts of the region, but many hundreds of homes, at least, were damaged. The Red Cross said it housed nearly 400 people in temporary shelters in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York Thursday night. On Friday, New York City’s Department of Education said that 234 of its roughly 1,600 public school buildings were affected by the storm, mostly by basement flooding, but that all the buildings will reopen when school starts Sept. 13. As of Friday afternoon, more than 30,000 homes in the region were still without power, including 20,000 in Pennsylvania and more than 7,000 each in New Jersey and New York. The status of mass transit in the region remains spotty. Most New York City subway lines are running regular service. But on commuter rails, all service of Metro-North Railroad is either suspended or limited, and three New Jersey Transit lines — the Gladstone, Pascack Valley and Raritan Valley — remain shut down. Long Island Rail Road service is back to normal. “We have to change everything,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said about the city’s storm response.Credit…Spencer Platt/Getty Images In the wake of the deaths of 13 people in New York City from this week’s flooding, most of them in basement apartments, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that the city would increase the use of evacuation orders and travel bans, issue stronger flood warnings to those living in basement apartments and send emergency responders door-to-door to help evacuate residents. “We have to change everything,” Mr. de Blasio said of the effort he called “Climate-Driven Rain Response,” which was immediately criticized by advocates and officials. “It’s not like the rain we used to know,” the mayor added. “It’s a different reality, a speed and intensity that we now have to understand will be normal.” The city recorded its heaviest one-hour rainfall ever on Wednesday, 3.15 inches, breaking a record set only days earlier by Tropical Storm Henri. Mr. de Blasio said that the city will now issue travel bans more quickly. And instead of using evacuation to remove people from coastal areas, the city will now move to evacuate people in basement apartments and other areas that face flooding from heavy rain. “This is a very forceful measure. It’s not just saying to people you have to get out of your apartment, it’s going door-to-door with our first responders and other city agencies to get people out,” Mr. de Blasio said. The city will target special phone alerts to neighborhoods, particularly in Queens, with heavy concentrations of basement apartments. The apartments are collectively home to tens of thousands of New Yorkers, largely immigrants, and are mostly illegally converted and subdivided units. In spite of warnings from the National Weather Service that New York City would see heavy rain and flash floods, Mr. de Blasio said the intensity of Wednesday’s rainfall was unprecedented and caught city officials off guard. “We’ve got to literally change the whole way of thinking because as good as some of the projections are, they can’t always keep up with weather that changes this rapidly and this radically,” he said on MSNBC. But the mayor’s plan was immediately panned by housing advocates and officials who said it left tenants who were caught at the intersection of the affordable housing crisis and the climate crisis just as vulnerable as before the floods. “It’s a bizarre plan because you’re talking about evacuating tenants who you don’t know where they live,” said Annetta Seecharran, the executive director of the Chhaya Community Development Corporation, which works on housing issues for low-income South Asian and Indo-Caribbean New Yorkers. “It’s rather neglectful to not address the root cause of the problem, which is how do we ensure people living in these apartments are safe? City Councilman Brad Lander, the Democratic nominee for city comptroller, said the city should provide basic safety improvements for basement apartments such as smoke detectors and then relaunch a defunded pilot program to convert illegal basement apartments. “It sounds like the mayor is saying let’s leave people in unregulated, illegal, unsafe basement units at large scale but hope they check their Notify N.Y.C. Twitter alerts, which does not sound like a good way to keep people safe” he said. Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for mayor, favors legalizing basement apartments and has criticized the decision to defund the pilot. Letitia James, the state attorney general, said the mayor should provide emergency housing vouchers for all residents of unregulated basement apartments. “Extreme rainfall and other severe weather events are now the rule, not the exception, in New York,” she said in a statement. “In the face of that risk, it is our duty to move these New Yorkers out of harm’s way by offering them safer, regulated housing.” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York spoke about the state’s death toll on Friday: “It’s hard to even read those numbers, because those numbers are people.”Credit…Stephanie Keith for The New York Times New York State officials were in the preliminary phases of assessing Ida’s damage on Friday, a day after President Biden approved an emergency declaration that will open up additional federal resources, including $5 million for affected counties. Even so, state leaders said they would need additional federal assistance to fully recover from Ida’s torrential rains, which inundated the region and killed at least 16 people in New York, where more than 7,000 people were still without electricity. Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Friday the state would easily surpass the $30 million threshold required to request a so-called major disaster declaration, which would loosen a wider range of federal aid for individuals and infrastructure projects. “I don’t ever want again to see Niagara Falls rushing down the stairs of one of the New York City subways,” Ms. Hochul said during a morning briefing in Westchester County. “I can’t prevent it right now, but I know we have to take action to mitigate that.” Power had been restored to more than 80,000 customers, but more than 6,400 households in Westchester County alone still lacked electricity. About a dozen roads, from the Bronx to Rockland County, were fully or partially closed. And the Metro-North Railroad system had sustained severe damage and “was not in good shape right now,” stressing that repairing it was “not going to happen very quickly.” Ms. Hochul said officials from the Department of Financial Services would fan out to help homeowners and businesses file insurance claims to receive reimbursements for damages, urging property owners to keep “good records.” “Homeowners, keep track of everything you have to spend to get your houses cleaned up and restored as best you can and then we’ll take it from there,” she said. Questions have already emerged over whether city and state officials were adequately prepared for the storm. While the state deployed emergency resources before the storm, for example, Ms. Hochul did not declare a state of emergency until early Thursday, when the brunt of Ida’s rains had already inundated roads and train tracks. “We did not know that we’d be in the same vulnerable situation with loss of life and property destruction,” she said, referring to the damage from Ida just days earlier in Louisiana and Mississippi. Ms. Hochul stressed that the staggering amount of rainfall that drenched the state in such a short window of time caught officials and meteorologists off guard on Wednesday night. “I think the meteorologists are surprised,” she said, adding that “Mother Nature does what she wants.” She said that people were properly warned about the flash floods via text, but that perhaps the warnings should have been translated into more languages or had failed to reach the “vulnerable population” living in basement apartments where many died. “We have to get a better system for evacuations and deploy people on the ground in these events and not hope that they got a message,” Ms. Hochul said. “I’m not even sure they own a cellphone.” Even so, she openly questioned whether the state could have done more to alert New Yorkers or to evacuate the subway system before stations began to flood. She promised to convene a task force to tackle such questions and put together an after-action report to determine if there were any “missed opportunities.” “I want to know exactly what we did right,” Ms. Hochul said. “If there’s any areas that were shortcomings, I want to know what they are and how we address them.” The city says that most of the apartments where people drowned in Queens were illegal conversions, including the one in this house in Jamaica.Credit…Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times New York City’s Department of Buildings said Friday that five of the six houses in which New Yorkers were killed by Wednesday’s flood were illegally converted cellar or basement apartments. Of the 13 people found dead in the city from the storm, at least 11 were in basement units, which have long made up a significant part of New York City’s vast housing stock, a network of rentals that often lack basic safety features like more than one way to get in or out. The department said that four of the five basement apartments where people were killed in Queens were illegal conversions, as was one on Ridgewood Avenue in Brooklyn, where another person died. Another basement apartment, on Grand Central Parkway in Queens, was a legal dwelling, the department said. It is illegal to alter an existing building to create additional apartment units without obtaining official approval, and such apartments are often considered unsafe by authorities, given their shoddy construction, poorly installed gas and electrical systems and light and ventilation issues. Still, the apartments remain in demand, in part because they are often far cheaper than most rentals. The buildings department has received reports of over 1,100 properties across the city that were damaged by the storm, and its inspectors are conducting safety checks at each location. “Our team is tirelessly conducting inspections at over a thousand properties across the five boroughs in the aftermath of Wednesday’s storm,” said the department’s commissioner, Melanie E. La Rocca. “We’ll continue doing everything we can to keep New Yorkers safe in their residences.” Climate change has made low-lying homes increasingly treacherous, because of the likelihood of deadly flooding as a wall of water blocks what is often the only means of escape. Last year, the department received 11,781 complaints related to units believed to be illegal conversions, down from 16,776 in 2019. So far this year it has received 8,072 such complaints. In about half of the cases since 2011, inspectors closed the complaints because they could not gain access to the dwelling, a New York Times analysis of buildings department data shows. Mihir Zaveri, Adam Playford and Nate Schweber contributed reporting. Essence Crockett was wrapping up a visit to her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer’s disease, when she heard her mother’s home health aide scream from the other side of the garden apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. “She started yelling from the next room, ‘Come, come! There’s water coming in!’” Ms. Crockett said. “I ran out into the living room and water was just forcing its way through her front apartment door and also her second garden door.” The two women — Ms. Crockett and the aide, Obianuju Okoro — began to frantically grab chairs and other items they thought might block the gushing water. But it would not stop pouring in. Claire Adams, 88, who cannot walk, was trapped in rising water that reached her neck before help came in through a window.Credit…Essence Crockett Ms. Crockett’s mother, Claire Adams, 88, can no longer walk, so the women ran to her room and began the laborious process of transferring her from her hospital bed to her wheelchair using a hydraulic lift. By the time they wheeled Ms. Adams into the living room, the force of the water had sealed both doors firmly shut. Water rose to their ankles, and then their knees. They were trapped. Panic set in. Ms. Adams, whom her daughter described as “agitated” even on a good day, began to scream, “I’m cold! I’m wet!” as the water rose around her in her wheelchair. “There was no way to explain what was happening to her,” Ms. Crockett, 60, said. As the water rose, she and Ms. Okoro began to lose hope. Looking at the windows, they realized they could push the air-conditioners out and perhaps scramble to safety. But they could not take Ms. Adams with them. “I thought this is the end,” Ms. Crockett said through tears on Friday. “I thought, it doesn’t make sense for us to all perish. I thought my mother’s aide should not sacrifice her life. And then I turned and said goodbye to my mother.” As they climbed, Ms. Crockett said, Ms. Okoro wept and kept saying, “Your mother, your mother!” When they got onto the street in front of the building, they were greeted by the panicked screams of their neighbors. Eight other garden apartments in the building were also being flooded. The lobby had filled with several feet of murky water, and the pressure of the rushing water had made its doors difficult to open. They tried to call 911, Ms. Okoro said, but the call would not connect. So she ran into the building to get help, wading through several feet of cold, leaf-strewn water in the lobby and climbing the stairs to the second floor to bang on the doors of Ms. Adams’s neighbors. Most of them were too afraid to go into the water. But soon she found a longtime neighbor of Ms. Adams, Michael Lettieri, who agreed to swim back through the lobby with her and followed her outside. “The whole lobby was flooded,” Mr. Lettieri said. “I never thought I’d see a thing like that in my life — it was like a white water river coming in through the door.” When he heard that Ms. Adams was trapped in her apartment, Mr. Lettieri climbed through the same window that Ms. Crockett and Ms. Okoro had fled through. Ms. Okoro and another man soon followed him. They found Ms. Adams in her wheelchair with water up to her neck, but were able to lift her back onto her bed, they said. “It was just her head that was out of the water,” Ms. Okoro said. “She was screaming, ‘I am cold!’” Credit…Essence Crockett The rising floodwaters had lifted the mattress off the hospital bed’s metal frame, and Ms. Adams was able to float on it like a raft. Mr. Lettieri stood there with her as water rose to his chest, making sure she stayed safely onboard, Ms. Crockett said. With Ms. Adams bobbing on the water in her flooded apartment, Ms. Okoro said she climbed back out the window and, with Ms. Crockett, flagged down a passing police car. Two officers came with them and broke down the apartment’s garden door so Ms. Adams could be taken to Forest Hills Hospital, where she was resting on Friday. Her home of 43 years has been “destroyed,” her daughter said. But they hope to rebuild. “We are here; mother is still here,” Ms. Crockett said. “This was a miracle. And I will forever be grateful for our neighbors and my mother’s aide, who was an absolute champion.” On Wednesday night, many couriers barely made enough money to justify the hours spent toiling in the floods, one advocate said.Credit…David Dee Delgado/Getty Images When Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to stay home and take shelter from the downpour and flooding Wednesday night, one group of people continued to go out: food delivery workers, many of whom were motivated by incentives from delivery apps. After a video of a courier walking his bike through murky waist-deep water to deliver a customer’s food sparked outrage, advocates for workers’ rights called on the city and delivery apps to increase minimum wages and strengthen safety protections. “The mayor is saying, ‘Go home.’ But the apps are giving economic incentives to the workers. ‘No, stay out, stay out,’” said Hildalyn Colón, director of policy for Los Deliveristas Unidos, a food delivery workers’ rights group in the city. Food delivery companies offer extra money when demand is high or during inclement weather, leading some couriers to risk their safety for the promise of potentially higher wages. Summer is also slow season in the delivery business, so many workers jump at the chance to earn more even in dangerous conditions. But on Wednesday night, many couriers barely made enough money to justify the hours spent toiling in the floods, said Ligia Guallpa, executive director of Workers Justice Project. Some Grubhub workers told her they made as little as $2 extra per delivery, she said. For the delivery service Relay, which enables restaurants to have food delivered through any delivery app, workers must complete at least 90 percent of their scheduled deliveries in order to be paid at all, Ms. Colón said. “That’s why you see these workers in the middle of the moving water holding a bag, trying to hold it together,” Ms. Colón said. A Relay representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Workers fear retaliation from the companies if they chose to turn down deliveries or sign off the app to go home, Ms. Guallpa said. Without the legal protections of full-time employment, there is little to keep them from getting lower ratings or getting deactivated by the apps if they decline deliveries, she said. “Workers were surprised to see companies were not providing incentives to go home, and there was no communication that no retaliation would happen if they opt not to take those deliveries,” Ms. Guallpa said. A DoorDash spokeswoman, Campbell Millum, said in a statement that while some workers may have been offered incentive bonuses Wednesday night, the company now regrets having pressured them to keep working. “Although we were able to pause delivery in some parts of the city as the flash flooding occurred, we should have acted more quickly and comprehensively to suspend ordering, turn off incentives to get Dashers on the roads, and communicate with all of our stakeholders,” she said, adding that the company was “putting in place controls to do better going forward.” A Grubhub spokesman said driver pay per order increased by a “double digit percentage” Wednesday night, and that drivers would not be penalized for turning orders down. Deliveries were also paused in parts of New York Wednesday night, he said, though he would not give details. Adding to the challenges delivery workers faced were equipment failures. One worker who lives in the Bronx had to spend all the money he earned that night fixing water damage to his electric scooter, Ms. Guallpa said. Los Deliveristas and the Workers Justice Project hope to push a legislative package of worker protections through the City Council later this year. “People asked, ‘Why did they risk their life?’ This is the way they make their living,” Ms. Colón said. “When they offer you $2, for them, it’s like a lifeline.” People cleaned up from the flooding in Flushing, Queens, on Thursday.Credit…Benjamin Norman for The New York Times The remnants of Hurricane Ida and resulting flood on Wednesday dealt a blow to the greater New York region — claiming at least 46 lives, damaging property and rendering homes uninhabitable. Here are answers to five frequently asked questions on home cleanup and more. How can I determine whether my home is safe to enter after a flood? According to the C.D.C.’s “Re-entering your Flooded Home” guide, you should have an electrician assess your home before re-entering. If you are set on re-entering, try to do it during the day to avoid the need for electricity, and do so carefully, as homes may have suffered structural damage. Ganesh Lallbachan, the owner of G&R Electrical Contractors in Queens, said that people should be particularly cautious if water reached the level of an electrical outlet. He advised the use of long rubber boots. If you smell natural or propane gas or hear a hissing noise, leave immediately and call the fire department. Before you begin the cleaning process, you should take photos to keep for your records, for insurance and in the event that you need to present your landlord with proof of damage. What possessions can I keep and what must I dispose of? “When in doubt, throw it out!” said Katie Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross. She added that items that absorb water and cannot be cleaned or disinfected included mattresses, carpeting, cosmetics, stuffed animals and baby toys. Get rid of all food that has come in contact with flood water, including canned goods. Don’t use water that could have been contaminated to cook, wash dishes or brush your teeth. Mold is a major concern after a flood or hurricane, particularly for people with respiratory problems. The C.D.C.’s “Guide to Mold Cleanup After Disasters” and the city’s website offer tips on dealing with mold. The C.D.C. also offers a guide on tools, cleaning agents and gear necessary for safely tackling cleanup after a flood or other disaster. My home is uninhabitable — where can I stay? “The onus falls on the landlord,” said Manuel Belliard, an aide in City Councilman Mark Levine’s office. If landlords with the ability to do so refuse to put their tenants up in a hotel or apartment, renters can seek out legal assistance from the New York Legal Assistance Group, Legal Aid or the Bar Association. Is my landlord responsible for reimbursing me for the cost of my damaged possessions? No. Your landlord is responsible for structural repairs, addressing issues with your roof, floors and walls. The cost of personal items like electronics and clothing fall to you. Going forward, consider renter’s insurance and make sure it covers flood and water damage. I’m rattled and traumatized by my experience — does New York City offer mental health services? Anyone can contact the city’s mental health services, by texting “WELL” to 65173 or calling 1-888-WELL-NYC. For disaster-specific trauma, call or text the Disaster Distress hotline at 1-800-985-5990. An underpass along Queens Boulevard on Thursday.Credit…Dakota Santiago for The New York Times New York State officials, bracing for a rush of insurance claims after record-breaking rain submerged large parts of New York City, are urging insurance companies to expedite storm-related claims. The message on Thursday from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurance companies, came as the damage from flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida was still coming into focus. “In this emergency situation, DFS expects all insurers to do their part,” the department said in a statement. It is “imperative” that insurance companies come to a “speedy resolution of claims.” The Department of Financial Services also said it would increase the number of people who could process claims by accelerating its process of approving independent insurance adjusters from outside the state to work in New York. When Hurricane Sandy pounded the New York area in October 2012, approximately 300 homes were destroyed, and more than 20,000 homes were damaged, according to city officials. North of the city, in Westchester County, the Red Cross opened a shelter in Mamaroneck High School for people whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged in the storm. It served 125 people on Thursday night and the shelter remains open, the organization said. The damage from the storm underscored how vulnerable major parts of New York City’s infrastructure are to extreme weather. For more information, New York City residents can type their address into this website and see whether their home is in an area at risk of flooding. The site, FloodHelpNY.org, was created by the nonprofit Center for New York City Neighborhoods, which receives funding from the city and state of New York.

Her neighbor, Roberto Bravo, died there on Wednesday night as surging waters poured in.Credit…Anna Watts for The New York Times The torrents from Ida’s waters cascaded through New York City basement doors and windows, turning everyday spaces into death traps. In Woodside, Queens, Deborah Torres said she heard the desperate pleas from the basement of three members of a family, including a toddler. As the water rushed into the building around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, Ms. Torres said she heard the family frantically call out to another neighbor, Choi Sledge. Ms. Sledge pleaded with the family to flee. Within moments, however, the cascade of water was too powerful, and it also kept anyone from trying to get downstairs to help. “It was impossible,” said Ms. Torres, who lives on the first floor. “It was like a pool.” The family did not survive. Darlene Lee, 48, was in a basement apartment that belonged to the super of a condominium in Central Parkway, Queens. Flooding burst through a glass sliding door in the apartment, and quickly filled it with about six feet of murky water. The water pinned Ms. Lee between the apartment’s steel front door and the door frame, leaving her wedged and unable to escape. Patricia Fuentes, the property manager, had just gotten off work when she heard Ms. Lee screaming for help and found her stuck. Ms. Fuentes ran to the lobby to call for aid, and Jayson Jordan, the assistant super, and Andy Tapia, a handyman, jumped through the broken glass door to get to Ms. Lee. But they could not save her. Ms. Lee was pinned and Mr. Tapia tried to help her keep her above the chin-deep water. Eventually, the men were able to pry her from the door, but it was too late, Mr. Jordan said. Ms. Lee was killed by the storm. In Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, Ricardo Garcia was awakened by a surge of water that he said exploded through the door of his shared basement apartment at about 10:15 p.m. In moments, it was up to his knees, then his waist, then his chest. Mr. Garcia, 50, banged on the door next to his, waking another roommate, Oliver De La Cruz, who was shaking on Thursday morning as he looked at the water stains that reached to the ceiling of his ruined room. Ricardo Garcia, who also lives in the Cypress Hills building’s basement, salvaged what he could from his room. Credit…Anna Watts for The New York Times “I almost died inside here, I almost died, man,” said Mr. De La Cruz, 22. Mr. De La Cruz broke down his bedroom door to escape in his boxer shorts. Mr. Garcia said that he and Mr. De La Cruz climbed to the first floor, struggling against the water pouring down the stairs. Mr. De La Cruz found his upstairs neighbor, Roxanna Florentino, who has lived in the building for 18 years. She said she heard another man, 66-year-old Roberto Bravo, crying out for help from a back bedroom in the basement apartment.

But water was pouring through both the front door and a window. She realized Mr. Bravo’s screaming had stopped. On Thursday, it was clear that the water had risen so forcefully where Mr. Bravo had been that it tore off the door and broke though the ceiling, leaving dank decay. The Ecuadorean flag hanging on his wall was soaked and muddied, the floor below strewn with debris, along with a water-stained photo of Mr. Bravo in a tuxedo at a formal event.

They brought out Mr. Bravo’s body. She tried to sleep but each time she drifted off, she heard Mr. Bravo’s voice, calling a last time. “It’s so hard when someone asks for help and you can’t help them,” she said. The remnants of Hurricane Ida pounded the region on Wednesday, dumping record rain and creating flooding in the five boroughs, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Service on the system was gradually improving by Friday morning.
Credit…Earl Wilson/The New York Times Two days after the remnants of Hurricane Ida brought torrential flooding and deadly downpours to New York, much of the region’s transit system was back up and running Friday evening. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority conducted round-the-clock repairs to get the nation’s largest subway system fully running again after the storm damaged tracks and turned platforms and stairwells into water slides. A majority of subway lines were back in service Friday with few delays and partial suspensions. (Check the latest service updates here.) “We’ve managed to restore a ton of service today but our tracks in Queens suffered the most damage,” the M.T.A. said on Twitter on Thursday night, urging those traveling in Queens to consider taking the Long Island Railroad instead. The Long Island Railroad will provide free rides between several Queens stations for those who show conductors their MetroCards or OMNY app. Our teams worked tirelessly throughout the night to restore subway service on almost all lines (the 6 remains partially suspended). While trains can run everywhere, service may not be frequent. Some lines have *extremely* limited service. In Queens, consider LIRR if possible. — NYCT Subway. Wear a Mask. (@NYCTSubway) September 3, 2021 Amtrak said it would resume service along the Northeast Corridor, between Washington and Boston, on Friday, but it said trains between Albany and New York City would remain canceled. New Jersey Transit said all train lines except Pascack Valley and Raritan Valley would resume operations as usual. The Newark Light Rail also reopened Friday evening after a small sinkhole that opened up on the tracks from the storm was repaired. The Long Island Rail Road resumed full service by Friday and will return to its usual weekend schedule Saturday. On the Metro-North Railroad, train service resumed Friday for the New Haven Line and the Harlem Line after workers cleared more than 10 inches of water and debris from several stations. Both lines will run enhanced weekend service as the Hudson Line, which suffered the most damage, remained suspended. “Our crews have made extraordinary progress over the last 24 hours in extremely difficult conditions,” Catherine Rinaldi, president of Metro-North, said in a statement Thursday night. “I cannot thank our crew members enough for the heroic work they have been doing and will continue to do.” On Twitter, the M.T.A. praised “hero bus operators” for keeping the city moving during Wednesday night’s floods and the days that followed. “As we head into Labor Day weekend, we’re thankful for the tens of thousands of essential workers across the tri-state who have been working nonstop to put the region back together,” the M.T.A. said on Twitter Friday. Flights on Friday morning out of La Guardia Airport, Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport largely appeared to be on time with minimal delays. In response to questions during a news conference Friday on how the M.T.A. could strengthen its system against future storms, Mayor Bill de Blasio called for the state to move quickly to implement congestion pricing. Mr. de Blasio also pointed to federal stimulus money included in President Biden’s proposed infrastructure bill, part of which the city would use to strengthen its public transit. “We need resources on a vast scale to fix the M.T.A.,” Mr. de Blasio said. “Congestion pricing will bring us the regular revenue to constantly make improvements.” The authorities responding to a basement apartment in Queens on Thursday, where flooding killed three people.Credit…Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times The warnings and maps seemed clear. On Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service issued a prediction that a wide swath of the Ohio Valley and the Eastern Seaboard would soon see heavy rainfall from what had once been Hurricane Ida. And one of the reddest portions of those maps — indicating severe rainfall and a high probability of flooding — hovered directly over New York City. Those predictions proved true. But the record intensity of the rain, with more than three inches falling in one hour, caught officials by surprise. And on Thursday, as the death toll in the Northeast increased, questions quickly arose as to whether city and state officials were caught flat-footed by the storm’s ferocity. The destruction in the New York region seemed especially striking considering that Ida had already blown through the Gulf Coast, hitting New Orleans on Sunday with far stronger winds but with fewer deaths. It also came in the wake of a series of ever-more-powerful tropical storms — including 2012’s Hurricane Sandy — which have been repeatedly cited as warning signs that the city’s aging infrastructure and subways are vulnerable to the violent weather caused by climate change. The subways, in particular, have come to act as a default sewer whenever heavy rains overwhelm the city’s actual sewer system. The storm’s devastation underscored the city’s increasing fragility in the age of global warming, but also illustrated how the unpredictability of weather events can topple even the best laid of plans. Manhattan on Wednesday evening. In the Northeast, the strongest 1 percent of storms now produce 55 percent more rainfall than they did in the middle of the 20th century.Credit…Stephanie Keith for The New York Times The torrential rains on Wednesday that soaked New York and New Jersey carried a stark warning about climate change: As the planet gets hotter, heavy rainstorms are dumping more water than ever before, threatening to devastate unprepared cities. Across the continental United States, the heaviest downpours have become more frequent and severe in recent decades, according to the federal government’s National Climate Assessment. In the Northeast, the strongest 1 percent of storms now produce 55 percent more rainfall than they did in the middle of the 20th century. Sept. 1, 2021 Between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., Ida dropped a record 3.24 inches of rain in Newark — nearly an inch more rain than the previous hourly record in 2006. July 21, 2006 Severe thunderstorms led to a one-hour precipitation total of 2.35 inches between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Sept. 1, 2021 Ida also produced the seventh-highest hourly rainfall, dropping 1.82 inches between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Sept. 1, 2021 Between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., Ida dropped a record 3.24 inches of rain in Newark — nearly an inch more rain than the previous hourly record in 2006.

In July, unusually heavy rains in Germany and Belgium caused rivers to burst their banks, washing away buildings and killing more than 220 people. That same month, days of torrential rain in Zhengzhou, China, submerged the city’s subway system and caused at least 300 deaths in the region. While scientists cannot always predict exactly when and where such rainstorms will occur, they understand how global warming is making them stronger. As temperatures rise, more water evaporates into the air from the oceans and land. And, for every 1 degree Celsius of global warming, the atmosphere can hold roughly 7 percent more water vapor. That means when a rainstorm does eventually form, there is more water that can fall to the ground, sometimes within a very short period. Recent studies have detected an increase in hourly rainfall extremes in parts of the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. And if the planet keeps getting hotter, the threat of more intense rainfall will grow. Earth has already warmed roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, driven by greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Without swift action to reduce those emissions, a recent report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned, the planet could warm twice that amount or more. Cities like New York are often more vulnerable to sudden downpours because so much of their land area is paved over with impervious surfaces like asphalt, which means that runoff is channeled into streets and sewers rather than being absorbed into the landscape."
"August jobs report: America added only 235,000 jobs in August",3809,"“Delta is reducing consumer demand and threatening to reopen,” said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao. “Ultimately, it’s just a hard reminder that the pandemic is our fate,” he told CNN Business. In normal times the August report would have been a cause for celebration, but today it is a big slowdown from the buoyant job reports at the beginning of summer. Friday’s report fell far short of economists’ already reduced expectations: the predictions for Friday’s labor market report had been revised down from 750,000 earlier to 728,000 after Wednesday’s ADP employment report, which also includes private payrolls, also disappointed. Almost a year and a half after recovering, the US economy is 5.3 million jobs down on February 2020 before Covid-19 put a wrench into the gearbox. Last month, 5.6 million people said they were unable to work or worked short-time because their employer was affected by the pandemic. With all the bad news, there was also some silver lining: The unemployment rate fell from 5.4% to 5.2% in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday. Also, the July job growth has been revised to 1.1 million, the first increase of a million or more since August 2020. Meanwhile, the leisure and hospitality industry, which generated job gains during much of the recovery after the sector was hit hardest during the lockdown, was not among the top hiring companies in August. Instead, professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, private education and manufacturing saw the largest increases in employment. In the leisure and hospitality industry, jobs were largely unchanged in August, but restaurants and bars lost 42,000 jobs. The leisure and hospitality sectors had been talking about labor shortages for the past few months, Zhao noted. But the Delta variant has caused Covid-19 infections to spike across the country, leading to a return in masking requirements and health safety guidelines – which is stopping some people’s travel plans. The retail sector also cut jobs in August. Concerns about contagion and the importance of Delta to the recovery also began to weigh on consumer sentiment, which plummeted in August to its lowest level since December 2011. The slowdown in employment growth is the latest dark cloud that has hung over the recovery in recent months. Economists are increasingly concerned about the rest of the year. Some fear a repeat of last winter – when Covid cases increased and led to renewed restrictions that led to job losses in December. That would be bad news for recovery. Economists had hoped that going back to school this month would help ease the burden of childcare for so many Americans and get many people back to work. But Delta could ruin that too. “It looks like the reopening of schools will be disrupted, which will keep parents away from working life,” said Zhao. The recovery has been mixed and this trend continued into August. Unemployment rates for white, Asian, and Hispanic workers fell, while black unemployment rose from 8.2% to 8.8%. The youth unemployment rate rose from 9.6% to 11.2%. The August job report was also very important to investors and the Federal Reserve, which is likely to stick with its ultra-accommodative policies for a while longer. The central bank cut rates and launched a massive asset purchase program to prop up the economy at the start of the pandemic. But the recovery has come a long way since then, leading investors to wonder when the Fed will normalize its policies. Rapidly rising inflation and improvements in the labor market created conditions that made the Fed more likely to cut its monthly bond purchases. But with a big job loss like Friday’s report, chances are good the central bank will stick to its policies until it sees more convincing numbers."
Apple leads the way as smartwatches dominate the wearable band market,1834,"The wearable market as a whole grew 5.6 percent in the last quarter, largely due to the sale of smartwatches at the expense of basebands, according to research company Canalys. The push was driven by Apple, which continues to dominate the market with its watch models. As Canalys noted, smartwatch sales took over the base of basebands (sports bands, etc.) as early as the fourth quarter of 2020 and now account for 62 percent of all wearable band shipments. Apple now accounts for 31.1 percent of the smartwatch market and 19.3 percent of the wearable band market as a whole, second only to Xiaomi in terms of number of shipments. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 Engadget Samsung also grew its smartwatch shipments year-on-year by 114 percent and saw further successes with its latest Galaxy Watch 4, which is now based on Wear OS 3 and was developed jointly with Google. Fitbit saw smartwatches grow 20.6 percent over sales around this time last year, powered by its Versa 2 and Sense models. In the basic band arena, Xiaomi now leads sales with a share of 19.6 percent – just ahead of Apple – led by its Mi Smart Band 5 and 6 models. However, these products are significantly cheaper, with retail prices of around $ 35 and $ 55, respectively. Overall, regardless of the product category, consumers are most interested in their health. “Health tracking is the most popular use case for smartwatches,” says Jason Low of Canalys. “The ability to deliver cutting-edge health tracking capabilities and deliver meaningful data and actionable health insights to users will distinguish winners and losers.” All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team independently of our parent company.

Opinion | Has Texas Spelled the End of Abortion Rights in America?,8456,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Supreme Court took a break from its summer break late Wednesday night to bring the nation’s most restrictive abortion law into effect in Texas and raise the alarm among people who support abortion rights – and even some who don’t. Access to abortion in the US has been declining for many years: According to the Guttmacher Institute, the 2021 legislative period set a record for most abortion restrictions in a single year in the US. Why is Texas law different and what does it mean for the future of abortion law in the United States? Here is what people are saying. Known as Senate Law 8, the law prohibits doctors from performing abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is usually possible four weeks after conception or as little as two weeks after a missed period. Because that’s before many even know they are pregnant – and because the law doesn’t make any exceptions for rape or incest – it amounts to a near-total ban on abortion in Texas. Texas law is not unprecedented in its limitations: several states, including Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio, have passed similar “heartbeat laws” in recent years. But two Supreme Court precedents – Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v Casey, the 1992 ruling that upheld that right – prohibit states from banning abortions before a fetus is viable, or about 20 to 22 weeks after conception, federal judges prevented these laws from entering into force. However, Texan law was designed to avoid constitutional challenges. As Adam Liptak of the Times explains, plaintiffs who tried to block a law on constitutional grounds would typically name state officials as defendants. But Texas law prevents state officials from enforcing it, thus making Roe v. Wade is effectively bypassed. Instead, the law empowers individuals – including those outside of Texas – to sue anyone who conducts or “favors” the trial. The patient cannot be sued, but doctors, clinic staff, counselors, people paying for the procedure, even an Uber driver taking a patient to an abortion clinic, can all be. Plaintiffs unrelated to the abortion in question are eligible for a minimum of $ 10,000 and attorney fees. On the other hand, the defendants have to pay their own way even if they win. “It’s completely transforming the legal system,” Stephen Vladeck, professor of constitutional law at the University of Texas at Austin, told the Times. “It is said that the state will not be the one to enforce this law. Your neighbors are. “ As David Leonhardt of the Times recently stated, the public has complex and, in many cases, contradicting views on abortion: a majority of Americans are in favor of abortion restrictions that Roe v. Wade would not allow himself to rule, even if an even larger majority said that they supported this. Indeed, Roe’s repeal could stimulate abortion rights advocates and advance the cause of judicial reform, which is why many legal experts speculate that Supreme Court justices do not specifically do so. “This is the genius of Texas strategy,” wrote Mary Ziegler, professor at Florida State University College of Law in Tallahassee, in the Times last week. “There doesn’t seem to be a compromise between relying on precedents and phasing out abortion laws.” And this law will eliminate the right to abortion Vendors say. Even those who abide by the law can face lawsuits from plaintiffs seeking a $ 10,000 reward, and they bear the financial burden of defending themselves in court. Abortion providers who moved to block the law said it would ban care for at least 85 percent of abortion patients in Texas, “which will likely force many abortion clinics to close eventually.” As of mid-August, all 11 Planned Parenthood Texas health centers that offer abortion have stopped scheduling abortions that the law bans, NBC reports. Texas law could still be temporarily blocked by the Supreme Courtstresses my colleague Lauren Kelley. But for now, at least, abortion is all but illegal in Texas. And “it now seems likely that more laws like SB 8 will be passed, as other anti-abortion leaders will certainly try to follow Texas’s lead,” she predicts. “Why shouldn’t they? The Supreme Court may not yet have ruled on the merits of Texas law, which some anti-abortion activists would no doubt prefer, but the state’s savage ploy has clearly succeeded in threatening the future of clinics across the state. In this way, the court has given the go-ahead to lawmakers everywhere who have been eager for decades to see Roe v. To overthrow calf. “ Orion Rummler notes in The 19th that Texas law could imply miscarriage management, which often uses the same procedure – dilation and evacuation, which Texas became the first state to ban last month – as second trimester abortions. While treatment for miscarriages would theoretically still be legal if cardiac activity is not detected, the wording of the law does not address the issue directly and could have a dissuasive effect on providers fearing civil liability. “Any doctor who removes a fetus from the uterus, either after a miscarriage or without a miscarriage, must document that they have tested a fetal heartbeat,” said Rachel Rebouché, law professor at Temple University and an expert in reproductive rights justice, said Rummler. The Supreme Court has also blessed a legal tactic that could undermine virtually any constitutional right Vox’s Ian Millhiser argues, “For example, imagine that New York passed SB 8-style law that allows individuals to sue anyone with a gun for a $ 10,000 bounty . Or imagine if Texas passed a law allowing similar lawsuits against anyone criticizing the governor of Texas. “ Times columnist Michelle Goldberg argues that one party is far more likely to be vigilant than the other. She notes that in recent years Republican lawmakers have not only boasted of endangering and even shooting alleged liberals, but also legalizing various forms of intimidation: several states have given partisan conspiracy theorists access to electoral equipment in order to find ways to make accusations underpin electoral fraud, for example, while other drivers have given immunity to beating people protesting on the street. “Texan law should be seen in this context,” she writes. The Supreme Court will look into this and other abortion cases in greater depth when it returns from hiatus in October. In addition to Texas law, judges are considering a law in Mississippi that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy (or about 13 weeks after conception). In this case, the judges will have little leeway to pretend, the lawyer Linda Greenhouse predicted in July: “The Mississippi mandate has made it impossible for the court to put any fig leaf over a verdict in favor of the state.” Maintaining an abortion ban means lifting Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey. It’s that simple. And for once a state says yes, that’s exactly what it wants. “ Proponents of abortion law have noted that it is still within the power of the Democratic Party to legislate abortion law: After all, the Democrats still control two branches of government, says Nikolas Bowie, a law professor at Harvard. However, some believe that the current Supreme Court is so hostile to abortion law that its power – or at least the power of its conservative judges – must be weakened in order for the right to abortion to stand up to judicial review. “Frankly, as long as conservatives control the courts, there is no way to stop Texas, Mississippi, or any other state from following their example,” writes Elie Mystal for The Nation. “If you want to protect a woman’s right to vote, the only solution is to expand the Supreme Court.” On Thursday, President Biden announced he would “launch a state effort” to determine “what steps the federal government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions.” But what those steps are – and whether a “state-wide effort” includes Congress – remains to be seen.

(GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) 98point6 CEO Robbie Cape no longer works at the heavily funded virtual health company he co-founded in 2015, GeekWire has learned. The company confirmed on Wednesday that Cape is out and the search for a replacement on the board is ongoing. It’s unusual for a Co-Founder and CEO to drop out abruptly without anyone standing in line. Sources say Cape’s departure came as a surprise to employees. Chairman Jeff Greenstein, an early investor in 98point6 through his firm YIS Capital, is serving as interim CEO. We have reached out to Cape and will update this story if we hear anything. Here is a statement from 98point6 COO Fukiko Ogisu: “As of today, Robbie Cape is no longer CEO of 98point6. We appreciate his six year vision and leadership. Even if Robbie is no longer with the company, we will continue to fulfill the mission he was instrumental in developing – to ensure that every single person on earth has access to high quality basic services without ever having to compromise financially it. The 98point6 board of directors is conducting a search for a new CEO. The C-level team will continue to lead the business and Jeff Greenstein, co-founder and chairman of 98point6, will serve as interim CEO while the board leads the search. “ Cape is a veteran of the Seattle tech scene. He sold his previous company, the family planning app Cozi, to Time Inc. in 2014 and previously worked for Microsoft for 12 years. In 2015, Cape co-founded 98point6 with Gordon Cohen, a professor at Arizona State University, and Greenstein (who has not become known as a co-founder to this day). The 350-person company is helping to enable virtual appointments for primary care and has reported great demand amid the pandemic. A $ 118 million Series E round began in October, led by private equity giant L Catterton and late-stage investment firm Activant Capital. At the time, the company was valued at $ 518 million, according to PitchBook. 98point6 provides primary care to more than 3 million patients in all 50 states and connects them in real time with their doctors using an AI-supported chatbot, texts and digital images. Customers include giant corporations like Boeing and Chipotle, as well as health insurance and healthcare systems. The company also offers a direct-to-consumer product. The startup makes money through a membership-based model. It charges consumers $ 120 per year and $ 1 per visit. For example, those using an employer-paid sponsored plan can access doctors at low cost or free of charge. The company says 60% of Americans are unrelated to primary care and the number is growing. “We’re trying to solve this problem by offering them basic services on their terms,” ​​Cape said in a video earlier this year. He added, “The depth of service we can provide and the breadth of service – even in primary care – is almost endless. That’s just the beginning.” 98point6 is one of a group of health tech startups that have seen increased use during the coronavirus crisis and aroused the interest of investors. Competitors include MDLive (acquired by Cigna earlier this year), Amwell, Firefly Health, Teladoc, and others. Aetna, a CVS Health company, launched its own virtual primary care service last month. 98point6 has raised $ 247 million to date. Investors include Goldman Sachs; BlackRock CEO Larry Fink; Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal; and Frazier Healthcare Partners Managing Partner Nader Naini."
Supreme Court Does Not Act on Texas’ Near-Total Abortion Ban,14229,"Der Oberste Gerichtshof weigerte sich, ein texanisches Gesetz zu blockieren, das die meisten Abtreibungen am Mittwoch kurz vor Mitternacht verbietet, weniger als einen Tag nach seinem Inkrafttreten und wurde zur restriktivsten Abtreibungsmaßnahme der Nation. Die Abstimmung war 5 zu 4, wobei der Oberste Richter John G. Roberts Jr. sich den drei liberalen Mitgliedern des Gerichts in abweichender Meinung anschloss. Die Mehrheitsmeinung war nicht unterzeichnet und bestand aus einem einzigen langen Absatz. Die Abtreibungsanbieter, die das Gesetz in einem Eilantrag beim Gericht angefochten hatten, hätten sich angesichts „komplexer und neuartiger“ Verfahrensfragen nicht erhoben. Die Mehrheit betonte, dass sie nicht über die Verfassungsmäßigkeit des texanischen Gesetzes urteile und „verfahrensgerechte Anfechtungen“ nicht darauf beschränken wolle. Aber das Urteil war sicher, die Hoffnungen der Abtreibungsgegner und die Befürchtungen der Befürworter des Abtreibungsrechts zu schüren, da das Gericht in seiner neuen Amtszeit diesen Herbst einen separaten Fall aufnimmt, um zu entscheiden, ob Roe v. Wade, die bahnbrechende Entscheidung von 1973, die ein verfassungsmäßiges Recht auf die Verfahren, sollte überstimmt werden. Es führte auch dazu, dass Abtreibungsanbieter in Texas Patienten abwiesen, als sie sich bemühten, das Gesetz einzuhalten, das Abtreibungen nach etwa sechs Wochen verbietet. Alle vier abweichenden Richter reichten Stellungnahmen ein. „Die Anordnung des Gerichts ist überwältigend“, schrieb Richterin Sonia Sotomayor in ihrer abweichenden Meinung. “Vorgestellt mit einem Antrag auf Erlass eines eklatant verfassungswidrigen Gesetzes, das Frauen die Ausübung ihrer verfassungsmäßigen Rechte verbieten und sich der gerichtlichen Kontrolle entziehen soll, hat sich eine Mehrheit der Richter dafür entschieden, den Kopf in den Sand zu stecken.” „Das Gericht hat die Bemühungen des Staates, die Überprüfung eines offensichtlich verfassungswidrigen Gesetzes, das unter Missachtung der Präzedenzfälle des Gerichts erlassen wurde, durch den Staat zu verzögern, durch verfahrenstechnische Verstrickungen der eigenen Schöpfung des Staates belohnt“, schrieb Richter Sotomayor. „Das Gericht sollte nicht so zufrieden sein, seine verfassungsrechtlichen Verpflichtungen zu ignorieren, nicht nur die Rechte von Frauen, sondern auch die Heiligkeit seiner Präzedenzfälle und der Rechtsstaatlichkeit zu schützen.“ Oberster Richter Roberts schrieb, dass er das Gesetz blockiert hätte, während die Berufungen vorangetrieben wurden. „Die gesetzliche Regelung vor Gericht ist nicht nur ungewöhnlich, sondern beispiellos“, schrieb er. „Der Gesetzgeber hat nach etwa sechs Wochen ein Abtreibungsverbot verhängt und die Durchsetzung dieses Verbots dann im Wesentlichen an die Bevölkerung delegiert. Die erwünschte Konsequenz scheint zu sein, den Staat von der Verantwortung für die Umsetzung und Durchsetzung des Regulierungsregimes zu entkoppeln.“ Der Oberste Richter unterstrich den vorläufigen Charakter der Mehrheitsentscheidung. „Obwohl das Gericht den Antrag der Beschwerdeführer auf Soforthilfe heute ablehnt“, schrieb er, „macht die Anordnung des Gerichts nachdrücklich klar, dass sie nicht als Aufrechterhaltung der Verfassungsmäßigkeit des fraglichen Gesetzes verstanden werden kann.“ Richterin Elena Kagan kritisierte die Praxis des Gerichts, wichtige Angelegenheiten in überstürzten Entscheidungen ohne vollständiges Briefing oder mündliche Argumentation zu entscheiden – zu dem, was Spezialisten des Obersten Gerichtshofs als „Schattenakte“ bezeichnen. „Das heutige Urteil zeigt, wie weit die ‚Schattenklage‘-Entscheidungen des Gerichts von den üblichen Grundsätzen des Berufungsverfahrens abweichen können“, schrieb sie. “Dieses Urteil, da müssen sich alle einig sein, ist von großer Bedeutung.” „Dennoch hat die Mehrheit ohne Anleitung des Berufungsgerichts gehandelt – das derzeit die gleichen Probleme prüft“, schrieb sie. „Sie hat nur die oberflächlichsten Einsendungen der Partei geprüft und dann nur hastig. Und es macht sich kaum die Mühe, seine Schlussfolgerung zu erklären – dass sich eine Anfechtung einer offensichtlich verfassungswidrigen Abtreibungsregelung, die durch ein völlig beispielloses Durchsetzungssystem gestützt wird, wahrscheinlich nicht durchsetzen wird.“ „In all diesen Hinsichten“, schrieb Richter Kagan, „ist die Entscheidung der Mehrheit ein Sinnbild für zu viel von der Entscheidungsfindung dieses Gerichts im Schatten – die jeden Tag unvernünftiger, inkonsistenter und unmöglicher zu verteidigen wird.“ Das texanische Gesetz, bekannt als Senate Bill 8, stellt ein fast vollständiges Abtreibungsverbot in Texas dar, da 85 bis 90 Prozent der Eingriffe im Bundesstaat nach der sechsten Schwangerschaftswoche erfolgen, so Anwälte mehrerer Kliniken. Am Dienstagabend bemühten sich die Kliniken um Patienten, bis das Gesetz in Kraft trat, mit sechsstündigen Wartezeiten auf Eingriffe an einigen Orten. Bis Mittwoch seien die Patientenlisten geschrumpft, sagten Klinikmitarbeiter in Interviews. Das Gesetz ist der jüngste Kampf um das Recht auf Abtreibung in den Vereinigten Staaten. In den letzten Jahren haben Anti-Abtreibungs-Aktivisten durch Gesetze in den gesetzgebenden Körperschaften der Bundesstaaten Erfolg gehabt, und weite Teile des Südens und des Mittleren Westens haben jetzt nur begrenzten Zugang zu Abtreibungen. In dem Notfallantrag, in dem die Richter aufgefordert wurden, einzugreifen, sagten Abtreibungsanbieter im Bundesstaat, das neue Gesetz würde „den Zugang zu Abtreibungen in Texas sofort und katastrophal reduzieren“ und höchstwahrscheinlich „viele Abtreibungskliniken letztendlich zur Schließung zwingen“. Präzedenzfälle des Obersten Gerichtshofs verbieten Staaten, Abtreibungen vor der Lebensfähigkeit des Fötus zu verbieten, dem Zeitpunkt, an dem Föten das Leben außerhalb der Gebärmutter aufrechterhalten können, oder etwa 22 bis 24 Wochen nach einer Schwangerschaft. Das Gesetz in Texas besagt, dass Ärzte keine Abtreibungen durchführen können, wenn ein Herzschlag festgestellt wird, eine Aktivität, die etwa sechs Wochen beginnt, bevor viele Frauen überhaupt bemerken, dass sie schwanger sind. Viele Staaten haben solche Verbote erlassen, aber das Gesetz in Texas ist anders. Es wurde entworfen, um eine Anfechtung vor Gericht zu erschweren. Normalerweise werden in einer Klage, die versucht, ein Gesetz zu blockieren, weil es verfassungswidrig ist, Staatsbeamte als Angeklagte benannt. Das texanische Gesetz, das keine Ausnahmen für Schwangerschaften aufgrund von Inzest oder Vergewaltigung macht, verbietet jedoch staatliche Beamte, es durchzusetzen, und beauftragt stattdessen Privatpersonen, jeden zu verklagen, der das Verfahren durchführt oder es „beihilfeet und unterstützt“. Der Patient kann nicht verklagt werden, aber Ärzte, Mitarbeiter von Kliniken, Berater, Personen, die das Verfahren bezahlen, und sogar ein Uber-Fahrer, der einen Patienten in eine Abtreibungsklinik bringt, sind alle potenzielle Angeklagte. Kläger, die nicht in Texas leben müssen, eine Verbindung zu der Abtreibung haben oder eine Verletzung davon aufweisen, haben Anspruch auf 10.000 US-Dollar und ihre Anwaltskosten werden erstattet, wenn sie gewinnen. Die überwiegenden Beklagten haben keinen Anspruch auf Anwaltskosten. Diese neuartige Formulierung hat Kliniken in Aufruhr versetzt. Dr. Jessica Rubino, Ärztin am Austin Women’s Health Center, einer kleinen, unabhängigen Klinik in der Landeshauptstadt, sagte, sie wolle zunächst einem verfassungswidrigen Gesetz trotzen. Aber sie sagte, sie sei zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass dies ihre Mitarbeiter gefährden würde. “Wenn dies ein strafrechtliches Verbot wäre, würden wir wissen, was das ist und was wir tun können und was nicht”, sagte Dr. Rubino. „Aber dieses Verbot hat zivilrechtliche Folgen. Es erfordert einen Anwalt, um vor Gericht zu gehen. Es erfordert Anwaltshonorare. Und dann 10.000 Dollar, wenn wir nicht gewinnen. Was passiert, wenn alle verklagt werden, nicht nur ich?“ Sie fügte hinzu: „Meine Mitarbeiter sind nervös. Sie haben gefragt: ‚Was ist mit unseren Familien?’“ Dr. Rubino sagte, ihre Klinik habe nach dem neuen Gesetz „so sehr gekämpft, um einen Plan zu entwickeln, um sich um jeden zu kümmern“, und am Mittwoch habe sie die neuen Richtlinien festgelegt. Sie fragte sich zum Beispiel, wenn jemand weiß, dass er mehr als sechs oder sieben Wochen schwanger ist – ungefähr die neue gesetzliche Grenze – sollte die Klinik ihm raten, den Staat zu verlassen und kein Geld für einen Ultraschall zu verschwenden? Laut Amy Hagstrom Miller, Geschäftsführerin von Whole Woman’s Health, das vier Kliniken in Texas betreibt, müssen Ärzte, die verklagt werden, selbst bei Abweisung der Klage die Klagen melden, wenn sie ihre Lizenzen erneuern oder Krankenhausaufnahmeprivilegien erhalten. Außerhalb des Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, dem einzigen Standort der Gruppe in der Stadt, der Abtreibungsdienste anbietet, gab es kaum Anzeichen dafür, dass sich die Rechtsgrundlage ändert. Auf der anderen Straßenseite stand ein blauer Bus, der kostenlose Schwangerschaftstests einer Anti-Abtreibungsgruppe anbietet, die regelmäßig präsent ist. Aber im Inneren war die Wirkung deutlich: Dr. Bhavik Kumar, ein Stabsarzt, sagte, er habe bis Mittwochnachmittag sechs Patienten behandelt, weniger als seine üblichen 30. Karte 1 von 4 Die Bürger, nicht der Staat, werden das Gesetz durchsetzen. Das Gesetz vertritt effektiv normale Bürger – einschließlich solcher außerhalb von Texas – und erlaubt ihnen, Kliniken und andere zu verklagen, die gegen das Gesetz verstoßen. Es gibt ihnen mindestens 10.000 US-Dollar pro illegaler Abtreibung, wenn sie erfolgreich sind. Schweigen des Obersten Gerichtshofs. Das Gesetz zur Einschränkung von Abtreibungen in Texas trat am Mittwoch in Kraft, nachdem der Oberste Gerichtshof einem Antrag auf Blockierung nicht nachgekommen war, was Kliniken im Bundesstaat dazu veranlasste, Frauen, die das Verfahren beantragten, abzulehnen. Bei Whole Woman’s Health of Fort Worth wurde der letzte Patiententermin am Dienstag um 23:56 Uhr abgeschlossen, sagte Marva Sadler, Senior Director of Clinical Services der Organisation. Sie sagte, die Ärzte hätten am Dienstagmorgen früh begonnen und 117 Patienten behandelt, weit mehr als sonst. „Es war ein absolut organisiertes Chaos“, sagte Frau Sadler, die aus San Antonio angereist war, um zu helfen. „Die Patienten warteten bis zu fünf und sechs Stunden, bis ihre Eingriffe durchgeführt wurden.“ Sie sagte, die Patienten warteten in ihren Autos und auch im Wartezimmer. Einigen wurde gesagt, sie sollten später wiederkommen. Am Mittwoch, sagte sie, befinde sich die Klinik in Neuland. Von den 79 Personen auf dem Zeitplan schätzte sie, dass etwa 20 in der Lage sein würden, ihre Verfahren schließlich abzuschließen. Viele, sagte sie, seien in ihrer Schwangerschaft zu weit fortgeschritten, um nach dem neuen Gesetz behandelt zu werden. „Die Leute sind verwirrt“, sagte sie. „Sie wissen nicht, wohin sie gehen sollen. Sie wissen nicht, was dieses Gesetz ist.“ Die unmittelbare Frage für die Richter war nicht, ob das texanische Gesetz verfassungsmäßig ist, sondern ob es vor einem Bundesgericht angefochten werden kann. Die Verteidiger des Gesetzes sagen, dass angesichts der Struktur des Gesetzes nur texanische Gerichte in dieser Angelegenheit und nur im Rahmen von Klagen gegen Abtreibungsanbieter wegen Gesetzesverstößen entscheiden können. Das Urteil des Obersten Gerichtshofs war vorläufig. Die Anfechtung des Gesetzes bleibt bei den unteren Bundesgerichten anhängig, und sie sind bereit, die komplexen Sachverhalte in dem Fall zu klären. Als das Gesetz in Kraft trat, griffen die Demokraten es an und versprachen, für den Erhalt des Abtreibungsrechts in Texas und im ganzen Land zu kämpfen. In einer Erklärung sagte Präsident Biden, die Maßnahme verstoße „offensichtlich“ gegen das verfassungsmäßige Recht auf Abtreibung, das von Roe v. Wade festgelegt wurde. In seiner nächsten Amtszeit, die im Oktober beginnt, wird der Oberste Gerichtshof entscheiden, ob Roe v. Wade in einem Fall aus Mississippi über ein von den Gerichten blockiertes staatliches Gesetz, das die meisten Abtreibungen nach 15 Wochen verbietet, aufgehoben werden soll. Der Texas-Fall, der ohne vollständiges Briefing oder mündliche Argumente auf der „Schattenakte“ des Gerichts stand, übertraf den von Mississippi. Die Gesetze von Texas und Mississippi gehören zu vielen Maßnahmen, die von republikanisch kontrollierten bundesstaatlichen Gesetzgebern erlassen wurden, um die Dauerhaftigkeit von Roe und Planned Parenthood v. Casey zu testen, der Entscheidung von 1992, die Roes Kernbesitz bestätigte und besagte, dass Staaten keine „unangemessene Belastung“ auferlegen dürfen das Recht auf Abtreibung vor der Lebensfähigkeit des Fötus. Die Gesetzgeber hinter den verschiedenen staatlichen Maßnahmen wetten darauf, dass der jüngste Rechtsruck des Obersten Gerichtshofs dazu führen wird, die neuen Gesetze aufrechtzuerhalten. Dem Gericht gehören jetzt drei Mitglieder an, die von Präsident Donald J. Trump ernannt wurden, der geschworen hatte, Richter zu benennen, die bereit waren, Roe v. Wade aufzuheben. Einer von ihnen, Richter Brett M. Kavanaugh, ersetzte Richter Anthony M. Kennedy, einen vorsichtigen Befürworter des Abtreibungsrechts. Eine andere, Richterin Amy Coney Barrett, ersetzte Richterin Ruth Bader Ginsburg, die den Zugang zur Abtreibung als wesentlich für die Autonomie und Gleichberechtigung von Frauen ansah. Zwei Monate nach der Unterzeichnung des Senatsgesetzes Nr. 8 durch Gouverneur Greg Abbott reichten Abtreibungsanbieter in Texas Klage beim Bundesgericht ein und nannten unter anderem jeden Staatsgerichtsrichter und Bezirksgerichtsangestellten in Texas. Die Angeklagten antworteten, dass sie keine ordentlichen Parteien seien und auf jeden Fall immun gegen eine Klage seien. Ein Bundesrichter lehnte einen Antrag auf Abweisung des Verfahrens ab und setzte eine Anhörung zur Blockade des Gesetzes an. Aber das US-Berufungsgericht für den fünften Bezirk in New Orleans hat die Anhörung abgesagt. Die Herausforderer sagten, sie hätten zumindest Anspruch auf eine Entscheidung über ihren Antrag auf vorübergehende Aussetzung des Gesetzes."

Ida Live Updates: The Latest on the Storm’s Aftermath in Louisiana,27041,"VideoHurricane Ida battered much of the Louisiana coast, with extreme flooding and damage to homes and businesses. Drone footage shows the extent of the cleanup in the area surrounding New Orleans.CreditCredit…Johnny Milano for The New York Times Entergy, Louisiana’s largest utility, announced early Wednesday that it had restored electricity to some of its customers in New Orleans, but it could be days longer before it and other Louisiana cities hit hard by Hurricane Ida have full power again. The company did not specify how many customers were back online. Nearly one million customers in Louisiana were still without power early Wednesday morning, days after Ida tore through the state, causing flooding and knocking out the transmission lines that power New Orleans. Restarting the city’s power station and critical infrastructure such as hospitals are top priorities. “We do have a glimmer of light or hope, if you will,” Patrick Hamby, a spokesman for Entergy said at a news conference in Jefferson Parish on Tuesday night. “The first light is coming.” The news came with the caveat that it could be a few more days before Entergy would have a better estimate of when widespread power would be restored. In addition to the widespread power outages, much of southeastern Louisiana was reeling from the Category 4 hurricane. Drake Foret, 31, a helicopter pilot from Houma, flew over some of the worst-hit areas on Tuesday, getting a bird’s-eye view of the damage and trying to transport people and supplies when he could. He said the damage was very bad in places like Golden Meadow, Galliano, Cut Off and Larose — a string of towns in the marshy areas along Bayou Lafourche, where strong winds had ripped the roofs off people’s homes. “That area took a really hard impact,” Mr. Foret said. “I would say at least half of all of the houses down there have severe damage.” His parents’ home in Larose had been destroyed, and he flew there to check on them, landing briefly to give them a hug. But he has since found it difficult to reach them by phone because of spotty service. “I think this is the worst damage this area has ever received, and I don’t think it will ever be the same again,” he said. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana said at a news conference on Tuesday that the state faces a long recovery. “This was a really bad storm, for many people worse than Katrina,” the congressman said. “We’ll continue pulling together, and we will get through this, like we’ve gotten through other disasters.” Ida was expected to move northeast on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said, bringing the potential for three to eight inches of rain from the Mid-Atlantic to southern New England. The Weather Service in New York said on Twitter that heavy rain from the system could bring “high potential for significant flooding impacts” to the area. The result of punishing wind and rain was evident in Louisiana, where Cynthia Lee Sheng, president of Jefferson Parish, said at a news conference that a caravan had been able to make it to Grand Isle. It reported back that the barrier island was uninhabitable. As a result of 10 to 12 breaks in a levee, Ms. Sheng said, 100 percent of structures were damaged and 40 percent were “either completely destroyed with just the piling showing, or maybe just a wall standing up on that building.” With no electricity and “extremely fragile” sewer and water systems, Ms. Sheng said she encouraged those still in the area to leave. “We do not have the services that a basic community has,” she said. “These are not conditions to be living in.” Cars snaked through a Costco parking lot as drivers waited to get gas in New Orleans on Wednesday.Credit…Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times The last time Peggy Gamberella, 63, heard from her younger sister, she said she had no drinking water or electricity and had lost everything in Hurricane Ida. The sister, Patricia Killingsworth of Chauvin, La., has a chronic lung disease and has trouble breathing when it’s hot. She relies on a machine to help her breathe, but that device needs to be plugged in. After Ida knocked out her power, Ms. Killingsworth was able to use someone’s generator, her family said. “I don’t see no help in sight for days,” Mr. Killingsworth, 61, wrote in a text message before pleading, “Send help if you can.” That was on Monday evening; the family hasn’t heard from her since. Ms. Gamberella said the family had been scrambling for two days to find help, but she lives more than 200 miles away, in Laurel, Miss. “I just pray she is OK,” Ms. Gamberella said. Roads are still blocked in some southern Louisiana communities throughout Terrebonne Parish because of downed trees and power lines, making access and rescue efforts difficult, according to Lauren Smith, volunteer coordinator and spokeswoman for the Cajun Navy Ground Force, a community-led disaster-response organization. She said that while response teams work to clear the roads, finding fuel to power generators, chain saws, equipment and vehicles is one of the biggest challenges. Having fuel for generators is especially critical for people with disabilities and medical issues, she said, citing a woman in need of hospice-level care whose generator went out on Monday. “We had to basically take all the fuel that was running generators for our camp and take it over and fill up her generator,” she said. In general, communities throughout the Gulf Coast region are more likely to rely on backup generators than solar power, which can lead to problems if there are fuel shortages, according to Andrew Schroeder, vice president for research and analysis at Direct Relief, a nonprofit humanitarian organization. “Every day that goes by becomes an increasing challenge,” he said. “The first 24 hours, you have maybe not too many problems. By the time you’re into a week, and we’ve seen this with a lot of other places, then you have problems with dialysis, and you have problems with oxygen generation and ventilation.” According to Department of Health and Human Services data, there are thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on electricity-dependent medical devices living in Orleans, Jefferson, Terrebonne Parishes and other places currently without power. In Lacombe, La., Megan Alfonso, 33, has been sheltering in place with her mother, Deborah Alfonso, since Saturday. Her mother, 63, who has chronic lung disease, usually relies on an oxygen concentrator machine that needs to be plugged in. But after the power went out on Sunday afternoon, she switched to using oxygen tanks. The family started out with five tanks; each one has enough air to last for about two and a half hours. By Tuesday morning, they were on their last tank. “She’s more scared then anything,” Ms. Alfonso said of her mother. “She started not using them and just risking it so she can save them.” After waiting for a response from emergency officials or response groups for hours, Ms. Alfonso decided to take a risk. On Tuesday evening, she drove to a medical supply office roughly 30 minutes away, even though she said the vehicle sounded “rough” after being submerged in water hours earlier. She got four full tanks of oxygen — enough for 10 more hours.

The Mid-Atlantic and New England area should anticipate three to eight inches of rain on Wednesday and into Thursday from Ida, the National Weather Service said. The storm hit Louisiana on Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane but has since been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, according to the National Hurricane Center. A National Weather Service meteorologist in New York warned the system would be a “significant rainfall event” and warned drivers to stay off the roads Wednesday evening. “The heaviest and the steadiest of rain looks to fall later tonight, probably after about 7, 8 p.m. this evening and continue into the very early hours of Thursday,” said Dominic Ramunni, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Long Island. The governors of Virginia and West Virginia declared states of emergency Tuesday night ahead of the system’s arrival. Significant & life-threatening flooding is forecast across the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England today ahead of T.D. Ida. 3-8 inches (with locally higher amounts) of rainfall will lead to widespread major flood impacts, especially in urban areas and areas of steep terrain. pic.twitter.com/jJ2mWcVcMl — NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) September 1, 2021 Widespread river flooding could occur in southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, particularly in the Monongahela, Potomac, Susquehanna, Delaware and lower Hudson River basins, forecasters said. The last storm to hit the Northeast was Henri, which made landfall in southwestern Rhode Island on Aug. 22 as a tropical storm, sending lashing bands of rain across much of New England that knocked out power in most of coastal Rhode Island, forced evacuations in Connecticut, stranded dozens of motorists in New Jersey and shattered rainfall records in New York City. At its peak, Henri left more than 140,000 households without power from New Jersey to Maine, and in New York City, cars were left stranded in flooded streets. And Henri had followed Elsa, which in early July brought relentless rain and flash flooding to much of the Northeast, downed power lines and forced would-be subway riders to navigate waist-deep waters on their way into one Upper Manhattan station. Meteorologists were warning on Tuesday that similar high amounts of rain could hit the region as the tropical moisture associated with Ida intersects with strong wind bands over the upper levels of the atmosphere in the Northeast, creating heavy rainfalls. A flash flood watch will be in effect from Wednesday night to Thursday for all of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Morning commutes on Thursday could be affected by drainage flooding in much of New England and the Mid-Atlantic, particularly in metropolitan areas, meteorologists said. “Obviously, it’s been so wet,” Mr. Ramunni said. “I can tell you it was the second wettest summer on record for Central Park,” he said, adding that the amount of rain in the forecast, “on top of how wet it’s been, is going to cause issues.” A flash flood watch will be in effect for New York City and nearby areas from Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon before moving farther into New England. “Ida is basically going to be exiting New England by Thursday night,” said Dan Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “But it’s going to drop heavy rain before it leaves.” Derrick Bryson Taylor contributed reporting. Lowe’s employees loaded a generator onto a truck in McComb, Miss., before Hurricane Ida’s arrival.Credit…Patrick T. Fallon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Downed transmission lines and power plants forced offline by Hurricane Ida have left New Orleans and much of the surrounding region with no electric service, and it may be weeks before repairs are complete. So thousands of people and businesses have turned to running backup generators and using other improvised means to try to keep at least a few of their lights and appliances working and their phones charged. But homemade power can come with risks, and the most insidious can be carbon monoxide. It’s a colorless and odorless gas produced by combustion, including the burning of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, natural gas or other fuels in a motor or generator. And if it builds up in the air you breathe, it can be deadly. At least 12 people in New Orleans — including seven children — have been taken to hospitals to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, the city’s Emergency Medical Services said on Wednesday. Running a generator in any confined space — a house, a shed, a basement — can be very dangerous, health experts say. So can indoor use of charcoal, any kind of gasoline- or kerosene-powered engine, or even a portable gas camp stove. Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, weakness, dizziness and nausea, according to the Firelands Regional Medical Center in Sandusky, Ohio. But if you are asleep or have been drinking, carbon monoxide can kill you before you become aware of any symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s not unusual to see reports of carbon monoxide poisoning in times of natural disaster or severe weather, when people lose access to regular sources of power and heat and have to improvise. Scores of people were sickened and died in February when a frigid winter storm plunged unusually far south, knocking out power and bursting pipes in places like Houston. But carbon monoxide poisoning is “entirely preventable,” the C.D.C. says. The agency urges everyone to have working carbon monoxide detectors in their homes at all times, and local codes require them in many places. When the alarm sounds, it should be heeded immediately, by seeking fresh air outdoors or at a wide open window and by making sure everyone in the home has reached safety. If you have a generator, use it in a well-ventilated outdoor area. If you run your car engine to charge a phone or other device, or make use of the feature on some vehicles that lets the engine be used as a generator, don’t do it in a garage.

Fountain for The New York Times The effects of Hurricane Ida will be felt far from where it made landfall in southern Louisiana on Sunday. As it moves across the Upper Ohio Valley and toward the Northeast later in the week, it is likely to cause heavy downpours, including up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of the Mid-Atlantic. More than 80 million Americans were under a flood watch or advisory, with the majority associated with Ida’s heavy rains. Although scientists are not yet certain about how climate change affects every characteristic of tropical cyclones, there is broad consensus that a warming climate will bring more extreme and heavy rainfall during storms. Warming increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which in turn can produce more rain. “We tend to think that once tropical storms move over land they run out of fuel,” said Rosimar Ríos-Barríos, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. But the winds in a tropical storm can extend thousands of miles from its center. In this case, even as Ida moves inland, Dr. Ríos-Barríos said, it will continue to draw in very warm, wet air from over the Gulf of Mexico and wrap it around its cyclone. That air can contribute to worsening rainfall. “We are seeing this increase in extreme rainfall for all types of events,” said Suzana Camargo, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. “With hurricanes, we would expect more intense rainfall. That’s what happened with Ida.” The amount of rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone has to do with how hard it rains and for how long, which itself depends on a cyclone’s speed. Rainfall from Hurricane Harvey, the wettest tropical cyclone on record, dropped more than 60 inches in eastern Texas in 2017. The heavy rain, and subsequent flooding, was caused in part by the hurricane stalling near the coastline. Ida was continuing to move at around 10 to 15 miles an hour, “an expected pace,” said Dr. Ríos-Barríos. The primary weather system in the United States moves in a general V-shaped pattern. Winds from the Western United States move south toward the Gulf of Mexico, then turn toward the northern Atlantic. But other weather systems can bring currents in opposing directions, changing the direction of a storm or altering its speed. As a tropical cyclone moves farther inland, its path is driven by a contrast in temperature. Dr. Ríos-Barríos said that may be one reason central Pennsylvania and West Virginia are expected to see such extreme rainfall, up to 10 inches in some places. There, the cyclone may develop a warm front, which will lift the air, create clouds, and produce more rainfall. Many of these areas in the storm’s path have already received exceptional rain this summer, leaving some rivers higher and soils more saturated, worsening the risk of flooding. The Middle Tennessee Valley, which experienced flash flooding earlier this month that killed at least 20 people, may see up to four inches of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. Whether climate change made Ida and the scope of its flooding more likely, and if so, by how much, won’t be known until scientists can perform an attribution study, a type of research that quantifies the links between climate change and specific extreme weather events. But scientists agree that Ida is a harbinger of future hurricanes. “If our planet continues to warm at the alarming pace that it is warming, then Ida is an example of what we might expect to see in the future,” said Dr. Ríos-Barríos. “That’s very scary.” A man identified as Benjamin Eugene Dagley, left, confronted Shaquille Brewster, an NBC reporter, as Mr. Brewster covered Hurricane Ida.Credit…MSNBC An arrest warrant was issued on Tuesday for a man who angrily confronted an NBC News reporter live on TV while covering Hurricane Ida in Gulfport, Miss., screaming, “Report accurately!” in his face. The man, Benjamin Eugene Dagley, 54, of Wooster, Ohio, will be charged with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbing the peace and one count of violating an emergency curfew, the Gulfport Police Department said. Mr. Dagley, who is on probation for an incident in Ohio involving a break-in at a metal plating shop, may also be in violation of travel restrictions that are part of his probation, the police said. The Gulfport police said Mr. Dagley had left the area by Tuesday and was traveling in his white Ford F-150 pickup truck. His location was unknown as of Tuesday night, the police said. It was unclear why Mr. Dagley had been in Gulfport — about 1,000 miles from his home — a day after a major hurricane hit the area. Phone calls placed to a number listed as belonging to Mr. Dagley were not returned on Tuesday night. A live report from NBC News shows that he whipped his pickup truck off the road and into the backdrop of Shaquille Brewster’s shot as the reporter described the effects of Hurricane Ida, which had made landfall on the Gulf Coast on Sunday. Mr. Dagley can be seen stepping out of his truck and running toward Mr. Brewster, who pauses and says, “I think we even have a random person going around.” “You’re reporting this accurately, right?” Mr. Dagley says. Mr. Brewster shifts so that the water is his backdrop and continues to speak to the camera. Mr. Dagley can be heard yelling in the background, though it is unclear what he is saying, and he is not visible in the shot. A few seconds later, the scene appears to escalate. “I’m going to toss it back to you,” Mr. Brewster tells Craig Melvin, an anchor for NBC. “We have a person who needs a little help right now.” Mr. Dagley is seen moving toward Mr. Brewster as he screams in his face, “Report accurately!” and bumps into him before NBC cuts away. Mr. Melvin then tells viewers that the network will check in with Mr. Brewster later and that “there’s a lot of crazy out there.” Later in the broadcast, Mr. Melvin says Mr. Brewster is OK. Mr. Brewster, who did not respond to emails and requests for comment on social media on Tuesday night, said in an Instagram post that he was “overwhelmed by the love and support” after “the wildest moment I’ve had on air.” “Our team joked about it afterwards, but it was without a doubt as scary for us as it was for you all watching,” he said. “While that one report was interrupted, we were right back up in the next hour and will continue reporting as we are here to do.” Appreciate the concern guys. The team and I are all good! — Shaquille Brewster (@shaqbrewster) August 30, 2021 Clevelend.com reported in 2017 that Mr. Dagley had been arrested on suspicion of breaking into an electroplating shop that he once owned and drilling holes into tanks holding dangerous chemicals. He pleaded guilty to vandalism, inducing panic and attempted assault, according to court records from Cuyahoga County. After the confrontation in Gulfport, Mr. Melvin said on Twitter, “This is beyond unacceptable and disgusting.” Troy Bonvillian looked at the damage to his flooring business in Houma, La., on Monday.Credit…Callaghan O’Hare for The New York Times Local and national volunteers and aid groups are prepared to rescue, feed and give shelter to those who have been affected by Hurricane Ida and its aftermath. Here is some guidance for those who wish to help. Natural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser. Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones. Donations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change. If you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams. All Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination. The Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more than 3,500 disaster-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said. Culture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin’ Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers. AirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm. Donations are welcome. SBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded in 2006 by a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members. A number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana’s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations. Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work. The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386. Bayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund. Louisiana Baptists, a statewide network of 1,600 churches, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here. AmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel. Mercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more than 15 million meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida’s wake and is accepting donations. GoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified. Project HOPE has sent an emergency response team with 11 medical volunteers and has distributed 8,000 hygiene kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief. The Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. About 600 volunteers were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS to 90999. The Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast. United Way of Southeast Louisiana is collecting donations for a relief fund to rebuild and provide long-term assistance, including community grants."
Hospitals see oxygen shortages; 80% of Californians have one dose,5092,"Despite recent increases in US vaccination rates and a slight decrease in reported cases in some of the hardest hit states, the recent COVID-19 surge has brought some hospitals back to where they were when the pandemic started – and for the crucial one Oxygen strapped. Hospitals in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Augusta, Georgia; and Lexington, Kentucky, are having conversations about what to do if they run out of oxygen and ventilators, among other things. In Tulsa, Dr. Jeffrey Goodloe, the chief medical officer of the ambulance service that serves Tulsa and Oklahoma City, told the Associated Press that a hospital ran out of oxygen within hours and had to call 911 for an emergency transfer of a patient on high-flow oxygen. “If it can happen to a hospital, it can happen to any hospital,” said Goodloe. Augusta University Medical Center ordered 12 additional ventilators to meet demand with the recent surge in hospital admissions for COVID. And in Lexington, emergency doctors are preemptively discussing whether multiple people can be connected to the same ventilator, AP reported. As hospitals have found, oxygen has been shown to be useful in treating COVID patients. A high flow oxygen tubing method uses up to three times as much oxygen as was used to treat patients at the start of the pandemic, Andy Brailo, chief customer officer for Buyer Premier, told AP.

California has reached an encouraging milestone in the fight against the coronavirus: 80% of eligible residents have now received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Governor Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that the vaccination rate in California has increased, with an average of 600,000 doses administered in the past two weeks. “But again, 80% is not where we need to be. We still have to reach those on the fence, “Newsom said. Newsom has urged all government officials, teachers and health care workers to either get vaccinated or have weekly tests, which is likely to lead to an increase in vaccines. The U.S. gets an average of 900,000 vaccinations a day, up from 500,000 a day in mid-July, the White House said Tuesday. The pace of first shots is also accelerating: the United States administered more than 14 million first shots in August – almost 4 million more first shots than in July, he said. According to the CDC, 72.2% of the eligible population 12 and older nationwide are at least partially vaccinated, and 61.4% of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated. – Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY The coronavirus has hospitalized about 5,100 more Tennessee residents in the past 14 months than previously reported – an increase of more than 20% from previous totals – according to newly replenished data from the state health ministry. Hospital admissions have been reported by anywhere from one to a dozen patients almost every day since the beginning of last summer, according to the new data. The majority of unreported hospital admissions occurred during the winter wave. The revised Tennessee total hospital admissions, including populated data, is 29,694. Sarah Tanksley, a health department spokeswoman, said the unreported hospital admissions have now been exposed because the agency added a new data source from the Tennessee Hospital Association to its COVID-19 tracking efforts. -Board Kelman, The Nashville Tennessee Contribution: The Associated Press"
"Clickety, a ‘project management for people’ tool from Puppet founder Luke Kanies, is shutting down",2062,"(Clickety picture) Clickety, a Portland, Oregon-based startup designed to help CEOs and managers record their relationships and conversations with employees, will close in late September. Puppet founder Luke Kanies, who founded the company in 2019, emailed customers Tuesday morning. Lukas Kanies. (Clickety photo) “It sucks to close,” wrote Kanies. “But we prioritize the health of our team members, which is the right choice, even if it’s sad, difficult and a little scary.” Kanies declined to provide further details when contacted by GeekWire. In an interview with GeekWire last month, Kanies described Clickety as “project management for people”. The software is similar to tools like Salesforce and Outreach that help sales reps keep track of leads, but is designed for executives who spend much of the day interacting with others in meetings, on the phone, or via email. Journalists, analysts and lawyers are also potential users. Clickety connects to email and calendar apps and tracks past conversations so users can remember topics for discussion, promises made, actions taken, or other important information. Clickety said it will have an official launch later this year, with plans to charge $ 25 a month or $ 250 a year. The startup raised a $ 2 million seed round from Founders’ Co-op, Flying Fish, Oregon Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, and angel investors including Kenny Van Zant, a longtime board member at Puppet, and Jay Simons, past president at Atlassian. The company employed six people last month. “We are incredibly proud of what we have built. We’ll miss using it ourselves, ”wrote Kanies. “And we still believe that what we built – a powerful tool to help people whose jobs are built on people’s work – is still needed. But we cannot continue our efforts. “ Kanies pointed out Folk and Dex to customers as alternatives to Clickety. Kanies founded Puppet in 2005. The company has grown into a leading cloud infrastructure automation company based in Portland, Oregon. In 2016 he left his daily duties but remains a member of the board."

Apple’s rumored iPhone satellite support may be for emergency calls and messages,2609,"The alleged satellite functions for future iPhones are only reserved for emergencies, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. A few days ago, a report by well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the next iPhones with support for satellite calls and messages will arrive in lower earth orbit. However, Gurman’s sources said Apple isn’t turning its devices into true satellite phones, at least for now. Instead, the tech giant is reportedly developing at least two emergency functions based on satellite networks. The first function is called Emergency Message via Satellite and is added to the Messages app as a third protocol alongside iMessage and SMS. Apparently codenamed Stewie within the company, it allows users to send emergency calls even when there is no signal, which sounds especially useful in emergencies in remote locations like mountains and forests. The tool also gives users the ability to send an SMS to their emergency contacts by simply entering Emergency SOS in the recipient line. Messages are limited to a shorter length, but the sender’s contacts will receive notification for them even if their phone is set to Do Not Disturb. Satellite messages are displayed as gray bubbles instead of blue or green so they can be easily identified. Finally, the function could also handle phone calls. Apple is also reportedly working on a second satellite feature that will allow users to report crisis situations like plane crashes and fires. This system allows users to report the incident in detail and asks them for details, e.g. B. whether someone needs search and rescue services or whether someone is armed nearby. It can also automatically send the reporter’s location and details from the health app to authorities, such as their medical history, age, medication, and information such as height and weight. The feature can also notify the reporter’s emergency contacts for them. While both functions sound useful, their availability is limited by satellite location and range. In some regions, they may not work, and in some cases, users may need to go outside in a specific direction for their iPhone to connect to a satellite. Gurman’s sources also said the features are unlikely to be ready before the end of the year, which means the next iPhones, which are slated to be announced in September, won’t be able to send news via satellite just yet.

Caldor Fire Intensifies and Evacuations Are Ordered Near Lake Tahoe,4392,"Wildfire that had burned through remote areas in the Sierra Nevada for two weeks crossed a ridge on Monday and began to descend towards major population centers along Lake Tahoe. As the fire at Caldor intensified in dry and windy conditions, thousands of people were ordered to evacuate along the south and west banks of the lake. Firefighters rushed to put out local fires just a few miles from South Lake Tahoe, California. Typically during the summer months, tourists flock to the lake on the California-Nevada border for boating, fishing, hiking, eating, and drinking. But at sunset on Monday the church seemed to have stood still. Shops and stores – motels, restaurants, supermarkets – were deserted on streets that had only been congested hours before. The streets were empty except for fire engines and TV reporters who documented the eerie calm. It was impossible to know when, if ever, the fire would reach the city. But people didn’t stay to test the fury of a fire that firefighters estimate could threaten more than 20,000 buildings. Public safety officials warned the Caldor fire, the youngest in California during a particularly unforgiving summer for firefighters in the west, showed no sign of giving way. It had burned more than 177,000 acres and was 14 percent contained on Monday. The mandatory evacuation zone stretched from Tahoma, California, on the west bank of the lake to the Nevada border. “I think there were some tense moments today for our citizens of South Lake Tahoe,” said David Stevenson, the city’s chief police officer, during a press conference Monday night. Starting Tuesday through September 17th, almost all California National Forests will be closed for public safety reasons. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades, meaning extremely dry conditions and gusts of wind up to 55 miles per hour are likely to cause forest fires to spread in the mountains. The warning applies until 11 p.m. on Wednesday for the area that was shrouded in haze on Monday. The smoke from the fire has worsened the air quality to an unhealthy level, said the US Forest Service. Firefighters battled fires on Monday on a dozen-mile stretch of an old Pony Express route connecting gold rush towns along the heavily forested western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. In some places, the crews drew water from the American River to put out local fires and protect the cabins along Highway 50. Extreme weather Updated Aug. 30, 2021, 6:09 p.m. ET Even at 5,000 feet, afternoon temperatures in the 1990s were unusually hot for the Sierra. Fireplaces were burning on both sides of the street. In the heart of the fire, the sky was orange and the valleys a thick slate of impenetrable smoke. Along the granite boulders that descend to the Lake Tahoe Basin, firefighters chased a point fire that had ignited on the slopes toward South Lake Tahoe. Firefighters and city officials had hoped the granite wall would act as a shield for communities along Lake Tahoe. But winds carried embers that leaped down the cliffs. Many evacuees faced bumper traffic after several major roads in the area were closed. Photos showed cars standing still on Highway 50, the main thoroughfare along the southeastern shore of the lake. Chief Stevenson said he was stuck on Highway 50 for about three and a half hours Monday. “I am so grateful that our citizens listened to the warning and order and evacuated the city,” he said. Known for its sapphire blue waters and evergreen bays, the lake is particularly popular with Bay Area vacationers. It is home to several famous ski resorts and casinos located just across the South Lake Tahoe border in Stateline, Nevada. Several concerts scheduled for this week at Harveys Lake Tahoe Casino have been postponed due to the risk of fire. Although forest fires occur every year in the west, scientists see the impact of climate change in the extreme heat waves that contributed to the intensity of the fires this summer. Long periods with unusually high temperatures are a signal for a change in climate, it is said. When the Caldor Fire threatened Lake Tahoe, the Dixie Fire, the largest single origin in California history, raged on in the northern part of the state. That fire had burned more than 771,000 acres in five counties by Monday and was about 48 percent contained, according to Cal Fire."
Hurricane Ida News: Storm Is Now a Category 4,13031,"Hurricane Ida will arrive on the Louisiana coast on the 16th anniversary of Katrina.Credit…Max Becherer/The Advocate, via Associated Press NEW ORLEANS — Hurricane Ida stoked fear and dread in Louisiana on Sunday as the approaching storm threatened to grow into one of the most powerful systems to assault the region since Hurricane Katrina, forcing residents to flee or hunker down as the storm quickly intensified to a Category 4 overnight and forecasters warned it had New Orleans in its projected path. The trajectory and strength of Ida will serve as a high-stakes test of the 350 miles of levees, flood walls, pumps and gates that were built up around the city as added storm protection after Katrina in 2005. Ida has also raised concerns about hospitals, which were overwhelmed by water and patients during Katrina and are already strained by the resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic. Ida is expected to arrive on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Katrina, stirring painful reminders of the death and devastation it wrought and the psychological scars that still run deep in the city. That storm killed 1,833 people, inflicted more than $100 billion in damage, and submerged large swaths of New Orleans, leading to scenes of suffering that horrified the nation. “It’s definitely triggering to even have to think about this,” said Victor Pizarro, a health advocate and a resident of New Orleans who planned to ride out the storm with his husband in the Gentilly Terrace neighborhood. “It’s exhausting to be a New Orleanian and a Louisianian at this point.” In the wake of Hurricane Katrina more than $14 billion was spent on the reconstruction of the area’s levee system. Levees, including those that failed during Katrina, were armored with concrete. Though the city was rebuilt to defend against a “100-year-storm,” or a storm that has a 1 percent chance of happening every year, local and state officials have said over the years that 100-year-protection isn’t enough at a time when weather events like hurricanes are intensifying and sea levels are on the rise. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana described Ida’s potential impact as historical. “We can sum it up by saying this will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s,” he said on Saturday. Ida, the first major storm to strike the Gulf Coast during the 2021 hurricane season, strengthened quickly in large part because, as is normal near the end of summer, the Gulf is very warm, and warmer water provides more energy to the storm. But research over the past decade suggests that climate change also plays a role. Studies have found that rapid intensification of hurricanes is also increasing because the oceans are warming as a result of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. Overnight on Saturday night, the storm first intensified to a Category 3, followed quickly by another upgrade to Category 4 an hour later. The storm threatens a state already imperiled by a different kind of disaster, as hospitals have been inundated by a surge in coronavirus cases. Daily deaths from Covid-19 reached their highest levels in Louisiana last week, forcing stretched hospitals to modify the intense preparations they would normally make ahead of an expected hurricane strike. The governor said officials had asked hospitals to check generators and stockpile more water, oxygen and personal protective supplies than usual for a storm. The implications of a strike from a Category 4 hurricane while hospitals were full were “beyond what our normal plans are,” he added. The decision to stay or go was made for some area residents on Friday when New Orleans city officials issued mandatory evacuations for residents living outside the levee system, echoing similar mandates for neighboring parishes. For those inside the levees, evacuations were voluntary. The Rev. Willie L. Calhoun, Jr., who lives in the Lower Ninth Ward, a New Orleans neighborhood that was ravaged by Katrina, had hoped to take part in a 16th anniversary commemoration Sunday, with a high school marching band and a theme, he said, of “healing, unifying and strengthening our communities.” Instead, on Saturday afternoon, he was in his Lincoln Continental on the verge of getting out of town. Sheri Fink,Henry Fountain, Tariro Mzezewa and Katy Reckdahl contributed reporting. New Orleans residents prepared to leave after the mayor asked for voluntary evacuations in anticipation of Hurricane Ida.Credit…Max Becherer/NOLA.com, via The Advocate, via Associated Press NEW ORLEANS — With Hurricane Ida likely to bring powerful winds and heavy rain to their city, residents of New Orleans faced a familiar choice: flee or hunker down for the duration. The storm was expected to make landfall by Sunday afternoon or evening and officials urged people who intended to evacuate to do so by Saturday. Residents came to a variety of decisions on the matter. Lacy Duhe, 39, and Jeremy Housely, 42, opted to hunker down in their second-story apartment on Deslonde Street in New Orlean’s Lower Ninth Ward. If they evacuated and ended up in a shelter, they said, they worried about the risk of their unvaccinated children contracting Covid-19. They also had just paid their monthly bills and could not afford to go anywhere. “It feels serious,” said the couple’s 11-year-old daughter, Ja-nyi. “I wasn’t born during Katrina time. But I know it knocked down a lot of places.” Mary Picot, 71, walked out the door on Saturday afternoon carrying bags of snacks and medicine. She wasn’t worried about flooding and believed the levees would hold. It was the threat of power outages that convinced her to leave. “My husband is diabetic,” she said. “We have to keep his medicine cold.” Donald Lyons, 38, was packing up a silver Nissan sedan Saturday afternoon under a cloud-filled sky in Hollygrove, one of the traditionally Black working class neighborhoods that flooded badly when Katrina hit. The car, carrying his wife, three children and mother-in-law, was full of bags and bedding. They were heading to Sugar Land, Texas, 27 miles southwest of Houston, where they had family that had left after Katrina, 16 years ago, and never come back. “I’m just trying to get somewhere safe,” Mr. Lyons said. Down the block, Barbara Butler, 65, a housekeeper, said she thought the city was safer now with all of the new flood protection. She intended to ride out the storm at home. “It gave us some relief,” she said. “It’s better than no relief.” She was sitting on the porch with her husband, Curtis Duck, 63, and her brother, Ray Thomas, in a house that Ms. Butler said was flooded with eight feet of water after Katrina. Mr. Duck said he was sick of evacuating time and again. “We listen to the news,” he said. “People telling us to go, go, go.” Victor Pizarro, a health advocate, and his husband decided to ride out the storm in their home in the Gentilly Terrace neighborhood, although they said they would leave town if they lost power for an extended period. “It’s definitely triggering to even have to think about this and make these decisions,” Mr. Pizarro said in a telephone interview while he drove across town in search of a spare part for his generator. “It’s exhausting to be a New Orleanian and a Louisianian at this point.” Andy Horowitz and his family decided to vacate their home in the Algiers Point neighborhood, which sits directly across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. Mr. Horowitz is the author of “Katrina: A History, 1915-2015,” and he is among those scholars and Louisiana residents who fear that the city’s new flood protection system, as massive as it is, may prove to be inadequate for a sinking city in the likely path of more frequent and powerful storms in the age of climate change. “Every summer, New Orleans plays a game of Russian roulette, and every summer we pull the trigger,” Mr. Horowitz said.

The overall impact of storm surge from Ida is predicted to be less severe than during Katrina. Because that storm began as a Category 5 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening as it approached landfall, it generated enormous storm surge, which brought over 20 feet of water to parts of the Mississippi coast. Current projections put the storm surge of Ida at 10 to 15 feet. “Fifteen-foot sure can do a lot of damage,” said Barry Keim, a professor at Louisiana State University and Louisiana State Climatologist. “But it’s going to be nothing in comparison with Katrina’s surge.” Improvements to the levee system following Katrina have better prepared the New Orleans metro area for the storm surge. However, the areas likely to receive the most severe surge from Ida may be less equipped to handle it than the area hit by Katrina, said Dr. Keim. Ida is expected to make landfall to the west of where Katrina struck, bringing the most severe storm surge impacts to the Louisiana coast west of the Mississippi River rather than east of the river along coastal Mississippi, as Katrina did. “We are testing a different part of the flood protection in and around southeast Louisiana than we did in Katrina,” said Dr. Keim. “Some of the weak links in this area maybe haven’t been quite as exposed.” While the impacts of Ida’s storm surge are expected to be less severe than Katrina’s, Ida’s winds and rain are predicted to exceed those that pummeled the Gulf Coast in 2005. Ida is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 storm with peak winds of 130 mph, while Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 with peak winds of 125 mph. “It could be quite devastating — especially some of those high rise buildings are just not rated to sustain that wind load,” said Jamie Rhome, acting deputy director of the National Hurricane Center. The severe damage from Hurricane Laura, which struck southwest Louisiana last year as a Category 4 storm, was caused primarily by high winds peaking at 150 mph. The storm caused 42 deaths and damage costing more than $19 billion. Ida’s rainfall also threatens to exceed Katrina’s highs. The National Hurricane Center estimates that Ida will drench the Gulf Coast with 8 to 16 inches of rain and perhaps as much as 20 inches in some places. Katrina brought 5-10 inches of rain with more than 12 inches in the most impacted areas. “That is a lot of rainfall,” said Mr. Rhome. “Absolutely the flash flood potential in this case is high, very high.” Especially combined with storm surge, he said, such intense levels of rainfall could have a “huge and devastating impact to those local communities.” Homes in Lake Charles, La., were covered with blue tarps after being hit by Hurricane Laura. Then Hurricane Delta swept through, knocking down trees and scattering debris from the previous storm.Credit…William Widmer for The New York Times Hurricane Ida threatens to be the first major storm to strike the Gulf Coast during the 2021 season, hitting a region in many ways still grappling with the physical and emotional toll of a punishing run of hurricanes last year. The Atlantic hurricane season of 2020 was the busiest on record, with 30 named storms, 13 of which reached hurricane strength. There were so many storms that forecasters ran through the alphabet and had to take the rare step of calling storms by Greek letters. Louisiana was dealt the harshest blow, barraged repeatedly by storms, including Hurricane Laura, which was one of the most powerful to hit the state, trailed six weeks later by Delta, which was weaker than Laura but followed a nearly identical path, inflicting considerable pain on communities still gripped by the devastation from the earlier storm. The state is still struggling to claw its way back. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said the state had $3 billion in unmet recovery needs. In Lake Charles, which was ravaged by direct hits from both hurricanes followed by a deadly winter storm and flooding in May, local officials recently renewed a plea for federal aid as the city has failed to regain its footing; much of it has yet to recover and many residents, unable to find adequate or affordable housing, have fled. The looming impact of Ida underscores the persisting danger imperiling coastal communities as a changing climate stands to intensify the destructive force of the storms that have always been a seasonal part of life. President Biden cited the growing danger in May when he announced a significant increase in funding to build and bolster infrastructure in communities most likely to face the wrath of extreme weather."
Google reportedly offered Netflix a special discount on Play Store fees,2334,"Google has been accused of playing favorites in treating Android app developers. The Verge reports that a recently unsealed consumer lawsuit against Google is being offered the company to make a “significantly reduced” cut in revenue from Netflix’s Play Store in an attempt to quell “the streaming giant’s displeasure.” Netflix, Spotify, and Tinder all reportedly tried to bypass the requirement to use the Play Store’s in-house billing system, and deals like this should get Netflix to use Google’s payment platform. The same filing also contains the claim that Google’s normal revenue sharing is arbitrary. Where the company typically calls for a 30 percent cut in Play Store purchases, it has apparently found that it could offset just six percent. Internal communications suggest that Google chose the 30 percent stake for no reason “except to copy Apple,” according to the lawsuit. We asked Google for a comment. In a statement to The Verge, a spokeswoman claimed that developers are bound by the same guidelines as “all other developers” and that efforts are being made to support app manufacturers with “increased resources and investments.” These initiatives are proof of “healthy competition” in operating systems and app stores, Google said. However, if the allegations are true, it wouldn’t be – Google would have given Netflix a bargain deal that is not available to other Play Store developers. The company wouldn’t be alone either. Internal emails also suggest that Apple offered Netflix perks that it didn’t make available to others using the App Store. Anyway, Google may have no choice but to change its practices. Apple recently softened the rules of the App Store as part of a proposed settlement allowing developers to offer customers alternative payment systems – something Google is still banning, as the lawyers behind the unsealed lawsuit point out. Between these latest revelations and other lawsuits like those from Epic and the attorneys general, Google is under heavy pressure to follow Apple and otherwise make concessions to avoid more serious legal repercussions.

Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines,96164,"Does a vaccine need to be fully approved by the FDA for an employer or business to mandate vaccination? Work/life schools/education vaccine myths & misinformation If I’ve already had Covid-19, should I still get vaccinated? What if I got monoclonal antibody treatment? “Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19,” the CDC said in August 2021. “Evidence is emerging that people get better protection by being fully vaccinated compared with having had COVID-19. One study showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than 2 times as likely than fully vaccinated people to get COVID-19 again,” the CDC’s website said. “If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.” Many doctors believe the immunity gained through vaccination is likely stronger and lasts longer than the immunity achieved from previous infection. “Many of the vaccines that we’ve made in history are actually stronger than the virus is itself at creating immunity,” epidemiologist Dr. Larry Brilliant said. Vaccine treatment & prevention work/life family schools/education transmission Now that a Covid-19 vaccine has been fully approved, what does that really mean? And what’s the difference between emergency use authorization and full approval? On August 23, the US Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for Pfizer/BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine for people ages 16 and up. Previously, all three Covid-19 vaccines used in the US — from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — were given emergency use authorization (EUA). The FDA had reviewed at least three months of safety and efficacy data and said the benefits of administering the vaccines outweighed the risks — especially given the public health emergency caused by Covid-19. But an EUA status does not mean a vaccine is less safe or effective than a vaccine that has been fully approved. “Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. There are two key differences between emergency authorization and full approval, Offit said. The first involves time, and the second involves a very detailed protocol for future production. “Full approval, for all practical purposes, just means three more months of efficacy data,” Offit said. When the FDA gave emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, “we could say they’re 95% effective for three months, because that’s how much data we had,” Offit said. “The FDA, for it to move to full approval — licensure — wants three more months,” or at least six months of data, he said. In the history of vaccines, the most severe side effects have all been caught within two months of a person getting vaccinated, Offit and other health experts said. After that, “your body has made the antibodies. It has done what it’s supposed to do,” said Dr. Julia Garcia-Diaz, director of clinical infectious diseases research at Ochsner Health in New Orleans. Any problems outside that window are most likely “not related to the vaccine.” Another reason why it takes a while to get full approval — or licensure — is because of a detailed validation process to help ensure future production stays precise and consistent. When the FDA fully approves a vaccine, “they don’t just license the product … they also license the process,” Offit said. “Because they want to make sure that every lot is consistently produced, they validate every aspect of the production. And they validate the building. So everything – the computers, the cleaning out of the vats, everything that’s done has to be validated.” As part of the review for full approval, FDA experts have been poring through a massive amount of documents, running their own analyses, getting any clarification needed from vaccine companies and thoroughly inspecting the manufacturing process. With full approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for ages 16 and up, more workplaces will likely issue vaccine mandates to help prevent the Delta variant from setting the country back further, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said. More people might want to get vaccinated on their own, too. A recent study showed some vaccine-hesitant Americans would be more likely to get a Covid-19 vaccine if it were fully approved. And with full approval, Pfizer/BioNTech are now allowed to market and advertise their vaccine, which has the brand name Comirnaty. Vaccine travel schools/education work/life transmission treatment & prevention Is it true kids can’t get very sick from Covid-19? Or that children can’t spread coronavirus to others? How many kids have actually been hospitalized with Covid-19? More than 50,000 children have been hospitalized with Covid-19 since August 2020, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it’s not just children with preexisting conditions getting hospitalized. Almost half – 46.4% – of children hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 2020 and June 2021 had no known underlying condition, according to CDC data from almost 100 US counties. During this Delta variant surge, an average of 309 children with Covid-19 were getting hospitalized every day during the week ending August 23, according to CDC data. “Kids can transmit the virus. They are susceptible to it,” said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA. More than 125 campers and adults who attended a Texas church’s summer camp for 6th through 12th graders tested positive for coronavirus. “And hundreds of others were likely exposed when infected people returned home from camp,” the lead pastor of the church said. At the University of Mississippi Medical Center, “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations of children,” Associate Vice Chancellor for Clinical Affairs Dr. Alan Jones said. “We’ve had infants as small as 6 to 8 months old up to the teenage years,” Jones said July 14. “We do know in Mississippi that the predominant strain that’s circulating — probably 88% to 90% of it — is the Delta variant,” Jones said. “That, associated with the fact that we are seeing a lot less mask usage now, is another variable that plays into the equation of why we’re seeing more” children in the hospital, he said. “Finally, it appears as though this particular variant, the Delta variant, while being more infectious is also causing more children to be symptomatic,” Jones said. “Whether that just is that it causes a little more severe illness than other variants or that it is just more prevalent — and so we’re seeing more symptomatic cases — we’re not sure. But it’s probably multifactorial and related to all of those things.” Some youngsters have suffered long-term effects from Covid-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) – a rare but potentially serious condition that can happen in children weeks after a coronavirus infection. And while pediatric Covid-19 deaths are rare, at least 476 children in the US have died from Covid-19, according to CDC data. Myths & misinformation Schools/Education family variants transmission vaccine When will the Pfizer vaccine be fully approved by the FDA for children ages 12 to 15? Family schools/education work/life vaccine When will the other Covid-19 vaccines get fully approved by the FDA? Vaccine work/life treatment & prevention Do we need Covid-19 vaccine booster shots? If so, when should we get another dose? Americans vaccinated with the two-dose Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines may be eligible for a third dose starting September 20, pending independent review of the safety and efficacy of a third dose, several US health officials said in a joint statement August 18. “We are prepared to offer booster shots for all Americans beginning the week of September 20 and starting 8 months after an individual’s second dose,” said the health officials, who include CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. The FDA has already authorized third doses for some immunocompromised people. For Americans who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, “We also anticipate booster shots will likely be needed for people who received the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Administration of the J&J vaccine did not begin in the U.S. until March 2021, and we expect more data on J&J in the next few weeks. With those data in hand, we will keep the public informed with a timely plan for J&J booster shots as well.” The health officials said the Covid-19 vaccines used in the US “continue to be remarkably effective in reducing risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even against the widely circulating Delta variant.” But immunity can wane over time, and additional vaccine doses could be needed to provide long lasting protection, the health officials said. With “the dominance of the Delta variant, we are starting to see evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,” the statement read. “Based on our latest assessment, the current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout. For that reason, we conclude that a booster shot will be needed to maximize vaccine-induced protection and prolong its durability.” The CDC and others say vaccination is still the best weapon in the fight against Covid-19. “Nearly all the cases of severe disease, hospitalization, and death continue to occur among those not yet vaccinated at all,” the joint statement said. Vaccine schools/education work/life transmission treatment & prevention variants Should pregnant women get vaccinated? “COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. “Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been growing,” the CDC said in an August 11 update. Scientists say Covid-19 — not the Covid-19 vaccine — can put a woman at higher risk of severe illness during pregnancy. Covid-19 can lead to “adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth,” said Sascha Ellington, team lead for emergency preparedness and response in the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health. “This vaccine can prevent Covid-19, and so that’s the primary benefit.” Family vaccine treatment & prevention work/life myths & misinformation Do vaccines still work against the Delta variant? Full vaccination significantly reduces the chances of severe illness, hospitalization and death from the Delta variant, though breakthrough infections are possible. “Vaccines continue to reduce a person’s risk of contracting the virus that cause COVID-19, including this variant,” the CDC said in a August 2021 update. “Vaccines are highly effective against severe illness, but the Delta variant causes more infections and spreads faster than earlier forms of the virus that causes COVID-19.” Vaccine effectiveness against coronavirus infection dropped from 91% to 66% once the Delta variant accounted for the majority of circulating virus, according to a study published August 24 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study is in line with others from the US and around the world showing Delta’s increased tendency to cause largely minor infections among fully vaccinated people. Still, the effectiveness of vaccines against severe disease — including hospitalization and death — has remained high against all known variants. Health experts say it’s important to take both doses of any two-dose vaccine. Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offered 88% protection against symptomatic Covid-19 caused by the Delta variant, according to a study published in May by Public Health England. But those who got only one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had just 33% protection against the Delta variant three weeks later, according to the study. “The key is: Get vaccinated. Get both doses,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said. Variants transmission family schools/education work/life travel vaccine With the Delta variant spreading, how much does vaccination reduce infection, hospitalization and death? Compared to unvaccinated people, “If you’re (fully) vaccinated now, your chances of getting infected go down by 3 1/2-fold,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said August 1. “Your chances of having symptoms go down by 8-fold. Your chance of ending up with illness significant enough to be in the hospital goes down 25-fold.” Such decreases in infections, illnesses and hospitalizations are “fantastically good for any vaccine,” Collins said. “We didn’t really have a right to dare they would be this good in the real world, and they are — even against Delta.” The Delta variant is more than twice as contagious than the original strain of novel coronavirus and appears to cause more severe disease, according to an internal presentation from the CDC. Still, more than 99.99% of people who were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, a CNN analysis of August 2 CDC data suggests. Vaccine variants transmission treatment & prevention schools/education work/life family Why do some people get breakthrough infections after being fully vaccinated? Are they getting Covid-19 from the vaccine? It’s impossible to get Covid-19 from a vaccine because there is no coronavirus in any of the vaccines used in the US. The vaccines can’t prevent people from breathing in the virus. What they can do is ensure that the body mounts a fast response to clear the virus if someone does get exposed. During that time, some people might actually become infected. But more than 99.99% of people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, a CNN analysis of CDC data suggests. As of August 2, more than 164 million people in the US were fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Among them, 7,101 people – or less than 0.005% – were hospitalized with Covid-19, and 1,507 people — or less than 0.001% — died, according to the CDC data. Those who get breakthrough infections generally have milder symptoms than unvaccinated people or no symptoms at all, CDC research shows. Because few people get tested after they’ve been fully vaccinated, there’s limited data on how many vaccinated people get mild or asymptomatic infections. But about half of states have reported data on Covid-19 breakthrough cases – and in each of those states, less than 1% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough infection, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis published July 30. More than 90% of people who end up in the hospital or who die from Covid-19 have not been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. It’s important to remember you’re not fully vaccinated until 2 weeks after your final dose of Covid-19 vaccine, so you’re still vulnerable in the first few weeks of vaccination. “Keep taking all precautions until you are fully vaccinated,” the CDC says. Work/life family transmission vaccine schools/education myths & misinformation What is the Delta variant? Is it worse than other strains of coronavirus? The Delta variant is the highly contagious B.1.617.2 strain of coronavirus first identified in India. It’s fueling rapid increases in infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the US, according to the CDC. “COVID-19 cases have increased over 300% nationally from June 19 to July 23, 2021, along with parallel increases in hospitalizations and deaths driven by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant,” the CDC said. In two months, Delta jumped from 3% to more than 93% of sequenced coronavirus samples in the US, according to CDC data. The Delta variant has a cluster of mutations, including one known as L452R, that helps it infect human cells more easily. “This variant is even more transmissible than the UK (Alpha) variant, which was more transmissible than the version of the virus we were dealing with last year,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said. In addition to increased transmissibility, “it may be associated with an increased disease severity, such as hospitalization risk,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An analysis of 38,805 sequenced cases in England showed the Delta variant carried 2.61 times the risk of hospitalization within 14 days compared with the Alpha variant when variables such as age, sex, ethnicity and vaccination status were taken into consideration. Variants transmission family schools/education work/life travel vaccine Do fully vaccinated people also need to wear masks because of the more contagious Delta strain? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on July 27: The guidance is stronger than in May, when the CDC said fully vaccinated people could unmask in most situations. But back then, the highly contagious Delta variant represented only about 1% of reported infections. By late July, at least 83% of sequenced samples were from the Delta variant. “The Delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that cause Covid-19,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said July 27. “This new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendations,” she said. “This is not a decision that we or CDC has made lightly.” Fully vaccinated people are less likely to get infected and also less likely to get severely sick if they do get a breakthrough infection. But new research suggests those with breakthrough cases might have as much viral load as unvaccinated people who are infected — meaning they might also be able to transmit the virus, Walensky said. States with below-average vaccination rates had, on average, almost triple the rate of new Covid-19 cases compared to states with above-average vaccination rates, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. For those not fully vaccinated, the CDC says it’s crucial to mask up: “Unvaccinated people should get vaccinated and continue masking until they are fully vaccinated. With the Delta variant, this is more urgent than ever,” the CDC says. “Getting vaccinated prevents severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.” Transmission variants family work/life vaccine schools/education vaccine travel Why should anyone care whether I’m vaccinated if they’re already vaccinated? Avoiding vaccination can harm loved ones and the country as a whole, doctors say. Full vaccination reduces the chances of getting and spreading the highly contagious Delta variant. Children too young to be vaccinated and those who are immunocompromised also rely on the vaccination of others to help protect them, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. But vaccination is also important to help prevent more contagious or more dangerous variants from forming — such as one that might evade vaccines and harm those who are fully vaccinated. “If we are going to continue to allow this virus to spread, we’re going to continue to allow … variants to be created,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia. Viruses frequently mutate as they replicate among infected people. If the mutations are significant, they can lead to a more contagious variant like the Delta variant, which is now the dominant strain in the US. “Think of a virus as a necklace full of different-colored beads,” board-certified internist Dr. Jorge Rodriguez said. “In position No. 1, you need a red bead. Position No. 2 is a green bead. That’s the genetic code – that sequence of bead colors,” he said. “When a virus replicates, it is supposed to make an exact replica of those bead colors. But every once in a while, maybe a green bead gets into where a red bead is supposed to be.” When mutations give the virus an advantage — such as the ability to replicate faster or to hide from the immune system – that version will outcompete others. The only way to get rid of variants is to lower the number of infections, said Penny Moore, an expert in viruses at South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases. That’s a big reason why doctors say people should get vaccinated as soon as they can. Those who don’t get vaccinated aren’t just risking their own health — they’re also jeopardizing the health of others. “Unvaccinated people are potential variant factories,” Schaffner said. “The more unvaccinated people there are, the more opportunities for the virus to multiply.” Variants schools/education work/life transmission vaccine myths & misinformation travel Is it true the Covid-19 vaccines don’t work as well in immunocompromised people?

If there are tissues nearby, you can take your mask off and sneeze into the tissue before putting your mask back on, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. For kids in school — or anyone else who might have to wear a mask all day — keep a backup mask in a baggie in case the first mask gets dirty. You can put the dirty mask in the baggie. It’s also a good idea to keep backup masks in your car in case of any mask accidents. Transmission schools/education work/life treatment & prevention I’m not feeling well, but I’ve already been vaccinated. Should I get tested for coronavirus? If you think you might have Covid-19 symptoms, “please get tested regardless of your vaccination status,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said. “We know the symptoms of Covid-19 mimic the symptoms of the flu or cold initially. It can be a runny nose or fatigue or other such symptoms. In those cases, it is important for people to get tested.” It’s impossible to get Covid-19 from a vaccine because there is no coronavirus in any of the vaccines used in the US. But Covid-19 vaccines don’t take full effect until 2 weeks after your final dose — “so a person could get sick if the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Those who are fully vaccinated are much less likely to get infected than unvaccinated people, the CDC says. In addition, “COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of people spreading COVID-19.” But while Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective, they’re not perfect. The vaccines require an immune system response to work, so millions of Americans who are immunocompromised or take drugs that suppress the immune system might not get as much protection from a vaccine as others do. The good news: When rare breakthrough infections do happen in vaccinated people, they’re usually less severe, CDC research shows. But it’s especially important for unvaccinated people who have Covid-19 symptoms to get tested. Unvaccinated people can spread coronavirus more easily than vaccinated people, the CDC says. “We have seen that many people are not getting tested around the country even though they have symptoms,” Murthy said July 13. “Many people are thinking, ‘Covid is over — why do I need to get tested?’ And this is particularly happening in areas, unfortunately, where the vaccination rates are low — which is where we want to be testing more.” Work/life vaccine family transmission treatment & prevention Is it safe to go on vacation?

In total, J&J plans to enroll a minimum of 4,500 pediatric participants up to age 17. “To keep children safe, and ultimately to achieve herd immunity, it is imperative that COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials continue to move forward in this population,” J&J said in a July 1 email to CNN. vaccine transmission treatment & prevention family schools/education My kids don’t want to wear a mask. What should I do? Children can be more reluctant because they’re more sensitive to new things than adults are, said Christopher Willard, a psychiatry lecturer at Harvard Medical School. “There’s also the weird psychological aspect of not being able to see their own face or other people’s faces and facial expressions,” which can hinder their feelings of comfort or safety, he said. To ease your child’s mask hesitancy, try buying or making masks with fun designs on them. Or have your child customize his or her own masks by drawing on them with markers. You can also order children’s face masks with superheroes on them or show your kids photos of their favorite celebrities wearing masks.

Research is still evolving, but a recent study examining antibodies suggests you could be immune for months after infection. “Although this cannot provide conclusive evidence that these antibody responses protect from reinfection, we believe it is very likely that they will decrease the odds ratio of reinfection,” researchers from Mount Sinai wrote. “It is still unclear if infection with SARS-CoV-2 [the scientific name for the novel coronavirus] in humans protects from reinfection and for how long.” There have been some reports of people getting infected twice within several months. Doctors said a 25-year-old Nevada man appeared to be the first documented case of Covid-19 reinfection in the US. He was first diagnosed in April 2020, then recovered and tested negative twice. About a month later, he tested positive again. A separate team of researchers said a 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong had Covid-19 twice, in March and August of 2020. Last year, an 89-year-old Dutch woman – who also had a rare white blood cell cancer – died after catching Covid-19 twice, experts said. She became the first known person to die after getting reinfected. work/life treatment & prevention schools/education myths & misinformation transmission Could I get coronavirus from the Covid-19 vaccine?

Vaccine family work/life What are the side effects of the vaccines? Some people have reported feeling temporary, flu-like symptoms. Don’t freak out if this happens to you, health experts say. “These are immune responses, so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that,” said Patricia Stinchfield of Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota. “And when you do, it’s normal that you have some arm soreness or some fatigue or some body aches or even some fever,” Stinchfield said. Read more about what to do if you do get side effects and why side effects are often a good sign. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has shown no serious safety concerns, Pfizer said. Pfizer has said side effects “such as fever, fatigue and chills” have been “generally mild to moderate” and lasted one to two days. Moderna said its vaccine did not have any serious side effects. It said a small percentage of trial participants had symptoms such as body aches and headaches. With the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the most common side effects were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue and muscle pain. While the CDC recommends the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, “women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS),” the agency says. “TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets. There are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen.” Work/life family treatment & prevention schools/education vaccine What are the long-term effects of coronavirus? Some Covid-19 survivors have reported problems weeks or months after testing positive. Even young adults have suffered long-lasting symptoms such as shortness of breath, chronic fatigue, brain fog, long-term fever, coughing, memory loss, and the inability to taste or smell. One CDC study found 35% of survivors surveyed still had symptoms two to three weeks after their coronavirus tests: And the risk of death from coronavirus-related heart damage seems to be far greater than previously thought, the American Heart Association said. Inflammation of the vascular system and injury to the heart occur in 20% to 30% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and contribute to 40% of deaths, the AHA said. AHA President Dr. Mitchell Elkind said cardiac complications of Covid-19 could linger after recovering from coronavirus. Work/life family transmission What is aerosolized spread? What’s the difference between aerosols and droplets? Aerosolized spread is the potential for coronavirus to spread not just by respiratory droplets, but by even smaller particles called aerosols that can float in the air longer than droplets and can spread farther than 6 feet. Respiratory aerosols and droplets are released when someone talks, breaths, sings, sneezes or coughs. But the main difference is size. Respiratory droplets are bigger – between 5 and 10 microns in diameter. (For perspective, a human hair is typically 60 to 120 microns wide.) “If you have droplets that come out of a person, they generally go down within 6 feet,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But aerosols (aka droplet nuclei) are smaller – less than 5 microns in diameter, according to the World Health Organization. “Aerosol means the droplets don’t drop immediately,” Fauci said. “They hang around for a period of time.” This becomes “very relevant” when you are indoors and there is poor ventilation, he said. Multiple case studies suggest coronavirus can spread well beyond 6 feet through airborne transmission, such as during choir practices, said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, chief clinical officer of Providence Health System. In Washington state, for example, 53 members of a choir fell sick and two people died after one member attended rehearsals and later tested positive for Covid-19. Last July, 239 scientists backed a letter urging public health agencies to recognize the potential for aerosolized spread. “There is significant potential for inhalation exposure to viruses in microscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets) at short to medium distances (up to several meters, or room scale), and we are advocating for the use of preventive measures to mitigate this route of airborne transmission,” the letter said. transmission treatment & prevention family schools/education work/life travel This pandemic is taking a toll on my mental health.

Family Work/Life Treatment & Prevention schools/education What “underlying conditions” put people at higher risk of bad outcomes with Covid-19? More than 40% of US adults have at least one underlying condition that can put them at higher risk of severe complications, according to the CDC. Those conditions include obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, according to the CDC. People who have cancer, an organ transplant, sickle cell anemia, poorly controlled HIV or any autoimmune disorder are also at higher risk. Covid-19 patients with pre-existing conditions — regardless of their age — are 6 times more likely to hospitalized and 12 times more likely to die from the disease than those who had no pre-existing conditions, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. While young, healthy people are less likely to die from Covid-19, many are suffering long-term effects from the disease. Treatment & prevention transmission family work/life What are the guidelines for riding in a car with someone from another household? Unvaccinated people from different households in a car should wear face masks, said Dr. Aaron Hamilton of the Cleveland Clinic. “You should also wear one if you’re rolling down your window to interact with someone at a drive-thru or curbside pickup location,” Hamilton said. It’s also smart to keep the windows open to help ventilate the car and add another layer of safety, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Travel transmission treatment & prevention work/life family schools/education Are coronavirus and Covid-19 the same thing? How did they get their names? Coronavirus and Covid-19 are not the same thing, but sometimes the terms can be used interchangeably. This “novel coronavirus” is novel because it just emerged in humans in late 2019. There have been six other coronaviruses known to infect humans, such as SARS (circa 2003) and MERS (circa 2012). “Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface,” or coronas, the CDC says. The scientific name for this novel coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.” Covid-19, however, is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The letters and numbers in “Covid-19” come from “Coronavirus disease 2019.” Myths & misinformation schools/education If a pregnant woman gets Covid-19, will her baby be infected?

That’s not recommended right now, according to the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. “This guidance may change as more becomes known about the course and treatment of COVID-19,” the network said. “Donation and transplant clinicians should apply their medical judgment in instances where test results are pending at the time of organ offers.” family transmission treatment & prevention Should we clean our cell phones daily? Yes, that’s a good idea because cell phones are basically “petri dishes in our pockets” when you think about how many surfaces you touch before touching your phone. You should regularly disinfect your mobile phone anyway, with or without a coronavirus pandemic. “There’s probably quite a lot of microorganisms on there, because you’re holding them against your skin, you are handling them all the time, and also you’re speaking into them,” said Mark Fielder, a professor of medical microbiology at Kingston University. “And speaking does release droplets of water just in normal speech. So it’s likely that a range of microbes – including Covid-19, should you happen to be infected with that virus – might end up on your phone.” Watch the best ways to disinfect your cell phone here. Transmission work/life treatment & prevention family Is it safe to go back to the gym? There are certainly risks if you’re not vaccinated. Coronavirus often spreads more easily indoors rather than outdoors — especially if you’re indoors for an extended period of time. Researchers have also found that heavy breathing and singing can propel aerosolized viral particles farther and increase the risk of transmission. During one fitness instructor workshop, about 30 participants with no symptoms trained intensely for four hours, according to research published by the CDC. Eight participants later tested positive, and more than 100 new cases of coronavirus were traced back to that fitness workshop. To help mitigate the risk, many gyms are limiting capacity or requiring masks. And while health experts have recommended staying 6 feet away from others, it’s smart to keep even more distance than that at the gym. “With all the heavy breathing, you may even want to double the usual 6 feet to 12 feet, just to be safe,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Transmission work/life treatment & prevention I tested positive for coronavirus weeks ago. How long are people contagious with Covid-19? Do I need to keep isolating or getting retested? For symptomatic carriers: If it’s been at least 10 days since your symptoms started and at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without the help of fever-reducing medication) and your other symptoms have improved, you can go ahead and stop isolating, the CDC says. Patients with severe illness may have to keep isolating for up to 20 days after symptoms started. (But it’s important to note symptoms typically don’t show up until several days after infection — and you can be more contagious during this pre-symptomatic time. Also, symptoms can last for weeks or months — including in young people.) For asymptomatic carriers: People who tested positive but don’t have any symptoms can stop isolating 10 days after the first positive test – as long as they have not subsequently developed symptoms, the CDC says. But 10 days is just a general guideline: “Because symptoms cannot be used to gauge where these individuals are in the course of their illness, it is possible that the duration of viral shedding could be longer or shorter than 10 days after their first positive test,” the CDC warned. With viral shedding, a person can infect others with the virus, even if they have no symptoms. Asymptomatic carriers who have tested positive can also stop isolating if they get two negative test results from tests taken more than 24 hours apart. At that point, it’s very unlikely they are still contagious. Work/life treatment & prevention family schools/education transmission I heard you can get Covid-19 through your eyes. Should we wear goggles, too? Doctors say wearing eye protection (in addition to face masks) could help some people, but it’s not necessary for everyone. Teachers who have younger students in the classroom are “likely to be in environments where children might pull down their masks, or not be very compliant with them,” epidemiologist Saskia Popescu said. “There is concern that you could get respiratory droplets in the eyes.” If you’re a health care worker or taking care of someone at home who has coronavirus, it’s smart to wear eye protection, said Dr. Thomas Steinemann, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. (Note: Regular glasses or sunglasses aren’t enough, because they leave too many gaps around the eyes.) But if you’re vaccinated or not in a high-risk situation, wearing goggles isn’t necessary. While it’s still possible to get Covid-19 through the eyes, that scenario is less likely than getting it through your nose or mouth, Steinemann said. He said if a significant number of people were getting coronavirus through their eyes, doctors would probably see more Covid-19 patients with conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye (though having pink eye doesn’t necessarily mean you have coronavirus). Transmission work/life treatment & prevention schools/education myths & misinformation Should people wear face shields instead of (or in addition to) face masks? The CDC does not recommend using plastic face shields for everyday activities or as a substitute for face masks. There are a few exceptions, such as for those who are hearing-impaired and rely on lip-reading or those who have physical or mental health conditions that would be exacerbated by wearing a cloth face mask. “Cloth face coverings are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult,” the CDC says. Clinical and laboratory studies show cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth – what the CDC refers to as “source control.” And many people are contagious even when they don’t have any symptoms and don’t know they’re infected. Face shields worn in addition to masks can provide an added layer of protection and can also help people stop touching their faces. Workers who are around people for long periods of time, such as grocery store workers or hospital personnel, may want to wear face shields in addition to masks, to increase their protection. If someone must use a face shield without a mask, the CDC says the shield “should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use.” Transmission treatment & prevention work/life schools/education Doesn’t the flu kill more people than coronavirus? Transmission family work/life myths & misinformation Could I have the flu and coronavirus at the same time? If so, what does that do to your body? “You can certainly get both the flu and Covid-19 at the same time, which could be catastrophic to your immune system,” said Dr. Adrian Burrowes, a family medicine physician in Florida. In fact, getting infected with one can make you more vulnerable to getting sick with the other, epidemiologist Dr. Seema Yasmin said. “Once you get infected with the flu and some other respiratory viruses, it weakens your body,” she said. “Your defenses go down, and it makes you vulnerable to getting a second infection on top of that.” On their own, both Covid-19 and the flu can attack the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, fluid in the lungs or respiratory failure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. “The two (illnesses) together definitely could be more injurious to the lungs and cause more respiratory failure,” said Dr. Michael Matthay, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. And just like with Covid-19, even young, healthy people can die from the flu. Doctors say the easiest way to help avoid a flu/Covid-19 double whammy is to get vaccinated. transmission family work/life schools/education myths & misinformation How can I tell if I have coronavirus or the flu (or both)? Both the flu and Covid-19 can give you a fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat, body aches and a runny or stuffy nose, the CDC said. “Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults,” the CDC said. But unlike the flu, Covid-19 can cause a loss of taste or smell. And about half of coronavirus transmissions happen before any symptoms show up. (Many of those people spreading the virus silently are pre-symptomatic and are more contagious before they start showing symptoms.) So the best way to know if you have the novel coronavirus or the flu (or both) is to get tested. The CDC has created a test that will check for both viruses, to be used at CDC-supported public health labs. Work/life family treatment & prevention schools/education myths & misinformation How do I prevent my glasses or sunglasses from fogging up when I wear a mask? First, make sure the top of your mask fits snugly against your skin. Then put your glasses over the snug-fitting top portion of your mask. If that doesn’t do the trick, soap and water can create a barrier that prevents glasses from fogging up. Here’s how. Work/life family schools/education treatment & prevention Are cancer patients at higher risk of severe complications from Covid-19? Yes. And the increased risk applies to cancer patients of all ages, the CDC says. “Having cancer currently increases your risk of severe illness from COVID-19,” the CDC says. “At this time, it is not known whether having a history of cancer increases your risk.” Researchers found that patients whose cancer was getting worse or spreading were more than five times more likely to die in a month if they caught Covid-19. But there are steps cancer patients can take to stay as healthy as possible: Family work/life transmission treatment & prevention Can central air conditioning spread Covid-19 in public places? Technically, it can, but HVAC (heating/ventilation/air conditioning) systems are not thought to be a significant factor in the spread of coronavirus. Many modern air conditioning systems will either filter out or dilute the virus. Ventilation systems with highly effective filters are a key way to eliminate droplets from the air, said Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen. Filters are rated by a MERV system – their “minimum efficiency reporting value” that specifies their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the better the filtration. HEPA filters have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20. HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases. They’re able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. For context, this coronavirus is thought to be between 0.06 to 1.4 microns in size. But “HEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,” Allen said. “But there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.” High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important. “If you’re an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,” advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. “In addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,” Bromage said. “It’s worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are.” Transmission family work/life schools/education What does asymptomatic mean? Work/life transmission schools/education How effective are different types of face masks? Which cloth masks work the best? An N95 respirator provides the best protection. But throughout the pandemic, N95s have been in high demand and short supply. As for other masks, different types have different levels of effectiveness, according to researchers at Florida Atlantic University. They compared four types of face masks commonly used by the public: a stitched mask with two layers of fabric, a commercial cone mask, a folded handkerchief, and a bandana. Researchers tested each to see which would likely offer the most protection if someone coughed or sneezed. — The stitched mask with two layers of fabric performed the best, with droplets traveling only 2.5 inches. — With a cone-style mask, the droplets traveled about 8 inches. — A folded handkerchief performed worse, with droplets traveling 1 foot, 3 inches. — The bandana gave the least amount of protection of the cloth masks tested, with droplets traveling 3 feet. — Still, any kind of cloth mask is better than none, the researchers found. Without any covering, droplets were able to travel 8 feet. “People need to know that wearing masks can reduce transmission of the virus by as much as 50%, and those who refuse are putting their lives, their families, their friends, and their communities at risk,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Treatment & prevention transmission What’s so different about coronavirus that made us shut down the economy? Why did we have to practice social distancing when we didn’t during the SARS and swine flu epidemics? Unlike SARS and swine flu, the novel coronavirus is both highly contagious and especially deadly, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. “SARS was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” Gupta said. “In the end, we know that SARS ended up infecting 8,000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. So very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.” The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.” What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well.” Work/life transmission treatment & prevention When are people with coronavirus most contagious? “People can be contagious without symptoms. And in fact – a little bit strangely in this case — people tend to be the most contagious before they develop symptoms, if they’re going to develop symptoms,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. “They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.” Some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. But it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health. “When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.” That’s why health officials suggests people wear face masks while in public and when it’s difficult to stay 6 feet away from others. Transmission treatment & prevention myths & misinformation Can you get Covid-19 through sex? The odds of transmitting coronavirus through sex hasn’t been thoroughly studied, though it has been found to exist in men’s semen. But we do know Covid-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can spread via saliva, coughs, sneezes, talking or breathing — with or without symptoms of illness. So three Harvard physicians examined the likelihood of getting or giving Covid-19 during sex and made several recommendations. For partners who haven’t been isolating together, they should wear masks and avoid kissing, the authors write. In addition to wearing masks, people who have sex with partners outside of their home should also shower before and after; avoid sex acts that involve the oral transmission of bodily fluids; clean up the area afterward with soap or alcohol wipes to reduce their likelihood of infection. Transmission treatment & prevention family myths & misinformation Is it true young people with coronavirus are also having blood clots and strokes? Yes, some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus. “The virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,” said Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. “Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of Covid.” Family work/life schools/education Why has the guidance on wearing face masks changed so much? work/life myths & misinformation transmission treatment & prevention How can I stay safe in an elevator?

For those not fully vaccinated, try to avoid public restrooms if you can, said microbiologist Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists. But he acknowledged that’s not always possible: “Sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go.” Close contact with others is the most significant risk in a public restroom, Nouri said. So if there’s a single-person bathroom available that doesn’t have multiple stalls, using that might be best. If you do use a multi-stall public restroom, Nouri offers the following tips: Transmission treatment & prevention work/life Is hand sanitizer as effective as soap and water in killing coronavirus? Yes — as long as you use the right kind of sanitizer and use it correctly. Hand sanitizers “need to have at least 60% alcohol in them,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. And don’t just put a little dollop in your hand and smear it around quickly. “You’ve got to use enough and get it all over the surfaces,” Schaffner said. “Rub it all over your hands, between your fingers and on the back of your hands.” But it’s always better to thoroughly wash your hands, if you’re able to. “Alcohol is pretty effective at killing germs, but it doesn’t wash away stuff,” said Dr. John Williams, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. “If somebody’s just sneezed into their hand, and their hand is covered with mucus, they would have to use a lot more alcohol to inactivate that bacteria or virus.” Schools/education treatment & prevention work/life transmission family Are some blood types able to fight coronavirus better than other blood types? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with Type A blood have a higher risk of getting infected with coronavirus and developing severe symptoms, while people with Type O blood have a lower risk – but the study has caveats. The researchers cannot say if blood type is a direct cause of the differences in susceptibility. It could be that genetic changes that affect someone’s risk also just happen to be linked with blood type, they said. The study’s findings, while plausible, may mean very little for the average person, said Dr. Roy Silverstein, a hematologist and chairman of the department of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. “The absolute difference in risk is very small,” he said. “The risk reduction may be statistically significant, but it is a small change in actual risk. You never would tell somebody who was Type O that they were at smaller risk of infection.” The bottom line: “All of us are susceptible to this virus,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead for the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 response. Treatment & prevention myths & misinformation What’s the risk of having a maid service come to clean your house if you’re not home? “It’s probably safe if you’re not at home,” emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen said. She suggested leaving the windows open to improve ventilation and asking the cleaners to use your own cleaning supplies so they don’t bring items that have been in other people’s houses. transmission work/life treatment & prevention family Can I disinfect my mask by putting it in the microwave? That’s “not a great idea,” said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine. “We have no evidence about that.” “If there’s a metal piece in an N95 or surgical mask and even staples, you can’t microwave them,” he said. “It’ll blow up.” Vinetz said cloth masks can be washed and reused, and even disposable masks can be reused if you let them sit for several days. To disinfect masks that you can’t wash, Vinetz recommends leaving them in a clean, safe place in your home for a few days. After that, it should no longer be infectious, as this coronavirus is known to survive on hard surfaces for only up to three days. treatment & prevention work/life myths & misinformation Is it safe to perform CPR on a stranger? Doctors strongly recommend performing CPR when someone needs it. You could be hundreds of times more likely to save that dying person’s life than you are to die from Covid-19 if you contract it after performing CPR, according to a report published by a group of Seattle emergency room physicians in the journal Circulation. But it’s important to act quickly for CPR to be effective. “The chance of survival goes down by 10% for every minute without CPR,” said Dr. Comilla Sasson, vice president for science and innovation in emergency cardiovascular care at the American Heart Association. “It’s a 10-minute window to death in many cases.” If you’re not certified in CPR, performing chest compressions could also buy more time until help arrives. Bystanders should “provide high-quality chest compressions by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the victim’s chest, with minimal interruptions,” the American Heart Association said. If you’re not sure how “fast” to do to those chest compressions, singing any of these popular songs will help you get the right rhythm. Transmission work/life family myths & misinformation Can I get coronavirus from swimming in open water, like in a lake or seawater? What about in a public pool or hot tub? It’s not the water you need to worry about. It’s how close you might get to other people. “Properly maintained pool water will not be a source of spread of the virus. The chlorine that’s in it will inactivate the virus fairly quickly,” immunologist Erin Bromage said. “The level of dilution that would happen in a pool or an ocean or a large freshwater body would not lead to enough virus to establish an infection. But when you do this, you need to just make sure that we’re maintaining an appropriate physical distance while swimming or sitting in a hot tub.” That’s because it’s easy for infected people with no symptoms to spread the virus if they’re within 6 feet from each other. If you have an indoor pool or hot tub, even 6 feet might not be enough distance. Transmission family travel treatment & prevention work/life I saw other countries spraying down sidewalks and other public places with disinfectant. Why haven’t we done that in the US? Randomly spraying open places is largely a waste of time, health experts say. It can actually do more harm than good. “Spraying disinfectants can result in risks to the eyes, respiratory or skin irritation,” the World Health Organization said. “Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is also not recommended to kill the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris, and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces,” the WHO said. “Moreover, spraying porous surfaces, such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways, would be even less effective.” Besides, the ground isn’t typically a source of infection, the WHO said. And once the disinfectant wears off, an infected person could easily contaminate the surface again. Treatment & prevention myths & misinformation travel transmission Can protests increase the spread of Covid-19? Any large gathering can increase the spread because this coronavirus is transmissible by talking or even just breathing. Carriers of the virus can be contagious even if they don’t have symptoms. And when people are “shouting and cheering loudly, that does produce a lot of droplets and aerosolization that can spread the virus to people,” said Dr. James Phillips, a physician and assistant professor at George Washington University Hospital. So doctors and officials say its important to get vaccinated or wear a face mask and try to keep your distance from others as much as possible. Transmission treatment & prevention work/life Do vitamin D levels affect your risk for coronavirus? Is there a correlation between vitamin D and those who test positive for Covid-19? “To date, there is no evidence that very high vitamin D levels are protective against COVID-19 and consequently medical guidance is that people should not be supplementing their vitamin D levels beyond those which are currently recommended by published medical advice,” wrote Robin May, director of the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham in the UK. Vitamin D is important for healthy muscles, strong bones and a powerful immune system. The recommended daily dose of vitamin D for anyone over age 1 is 15 mcg/600 IU per day in the US. For anyone over 70 years of age in the US, the recommended daily intake goes up to 20 mcg/800 IU per day. But too much vitamin D can lead to a toxic buildup of calcium in your blood that can cause confusion, disorientation, heart rhythm problems, bone pain, kidney damage and painful kidney stones. Treatment & prevention myths & misinformation Can you get coronavirus from touching money? What about from other objects, like plants? “Viruses can live on surfaces and objects — including on money — although your chance of actually getting COVID-19 from cash is probably very low,” emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said. The new coronavirus can live for up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic, up to 24 hours after landing on cardboard, and up to four hours after landing on copper, according to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health. So how do you protect yourself? To avoid touching cash or coins, use contactless methods of payment whenever possible, Wen said. If you can’t use a contactless form of payment, credit cards and debit cards are much easier to clean and disinfect than cash. But remember that anyone who touches your credit card can also leave germs on it. If you must use cash, “wash your hands well with soap and water” afterward, Wen said. The same applies for anything else you touch that might have coronavirus on it. If you can’t wash your hands immediately, use hand sanitzier or disinfectant. And since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, make sure you avoid touching your face. Transmission work/life treatment & prevention Can you get coronavirus by touching a dead body or the ashes of someone who had Covid-19? It appears unlikely, but the CDC advises taking precautions. Experts believe coronavirus is mainly spread during close contact (about 6 feet) with a person who is currently infected, the CDC said. “This type of spread is not a concern after death,” the CDC said. But it cautions that “we are still learning how it spreads.” “There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing,” the CDC said. “Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.” If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, “families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,” the CDC said. “At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).” Cremated remains can be considered sterile, as infectious agents do not survive incineration-range temperatures, the CDC said. Myths & misinformation transmission family Can UV light kill coronavirus? While some UV light devices are used for hospital disinfection, UV light only kills germs under very specific conditions — including certain irradiation dosages and exposure times, the World Health Organization said. But UV light can also damage the body. Two factors are required for UV light to destroy a virus: intensity and time. If the light is intense enough to break apart a virus in a short time, it’s going to be dangerous to people, said Donald Milton, a professor at the University of Maryland. UVA and UVB light both damage the skin. UVC light is safer for skin, but it will damage tender tissue such as the eyes. Myths & misinformation treatment & prevention Do I need to wash fruits and vegetables with soap and water? No. The US Food and Drug Administration says you don’t need to wash fresh produce with soap and water, but you should rinse it with plain water. But it’s still important to wash your hands with soap and water frequently because we often touch our faces without realizing it. And that’s a way coronavirus can spread. You don’t have to worry about getting coronavirus by “eating” it, though. Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. Treatment & prevention work/life transmission Can coronavirus stay in my hair or in a beard? Should I wash my hair every day? Coronavirus can stick to hair, said Dr. David Aronoff, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “Like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” Aronoff said. But that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. That’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said. “If you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. But it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces. If your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.” If your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, King said. As for facial hair, “washing at least daily if not more frequently is wise, depending on how often they touch their face,” Aronoff said. Transmission treatment & prevention work/life Could I infect my pets with coronavirus, or vice versa? Can someone get infected by touching an animal’s fur? Should I get my pet tested for coronavirus? There have been some reports of animals infected with coronavirus — including two pets in New York and eight big cats at the Bronx Zoo. Most of those infections came from contact with humans who had coronavirus, like a zoo employee who was an asymptomatic carrier. But according to the CDC, there is no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans. Therefore, at this time, routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended. As always, it’s best to wash your hands after touching an animal’s fur and before touching your face. And if your pet appears to be sick, call your veterinarian. Family work/life treatment & prevention transmission Should I wash my hands and laundry in very warm or hot water? Hot water is best for killing bacteria and viruses in your laundry. But you don’t want to use that kind of scalding hot water on your skin. Warm water is perfectly fine for washing your hands — as long as you wash them thoroughly (like this) and for at least 20 seconds. (To time yourself, you can hum the “Happy Birthday” song twice or sing a couple of verses from any of these hit songs from the past several decades.) Cold water will also work, “but you have to make sure you work really vigorously to get a lather and get everything soapy and bubbly,” said chemist Bill Wuest, an associate professor at Emory University. To do that, you might need to sing “Happy Birthday” three times instead of twice. “Warm water with soap gets a much better lather – more bubbles,” Wuest said. “It’s an indication that the soap is … trying to encapsulate the dirt and the bacteria and the viruses in them.” Treatment & prevention work/life transmission myths & misinformation How does soap kill coronavirus? If I don’t have disinfecting wipes, can I use soap and water on surfaces? Yes, you can use soap and water on surfaces just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don’t use water alone — that won’t really help. The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead. In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you’re trying to clean. “You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish,” said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. “You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.” By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.” Work/life transmission treatment & prevention schools/education Can coronavirus be transferred by people’s shoes? How do I protect kids who crawl or play on the floor? Yes, coronavirus can live on the soles of shoes, but the risk of getting Covid-19 from shoes appears to be low. A report published by the CDC highlighted a study from a hospital in Wuhan, China, where this coronavirus outbreak began. The soles of medical workers’ shoes were swabbed and analyzed, and the study found that the virus was “widely distributed” on floors, computer mice, trash cans and door knobs. But it’s important to note the study was done in a hospital, where the virus was concentrated. It’s still possible to pick up coronavirus on the bottoms of your shoes by running errands, but it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from it because people don’t often touch the soles of their shoes and then their faces. Because Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, the CDC advises wearing a mask while in public and washing your hands frequently– the correct way. If you have small children who crawl or regularly touch the floor, it’s a good idea to take your shoes off as soon you get home to prevent coronavirus or bacteria from spreading on the floors. transmission family treatment & prevention schools/education Can I get coronavirus through food? Is it safe to eat takeout from restaurants? There’s no evidence that coronavirus can be transmitted through food, the CDC says. Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “When you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there’s a high acidity, low-pH environment that will inactivate the virus,” she said. But it’s a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it’s easy to touch your face without realizing it. If you don’t have disinfecting wipes, use your own plates or bowls to serve the food. Just make sure to wash your hands after transferring food from the containers. transmission family work/life Can coronavirus spread through water, like in a swimming pool or hot tub? “There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs,” the CDC says. “Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.” But health officials still advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water. As for drinking water, doctors say you don’t need to worry about coronavirus in the tap water because most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate the virus. Transmission work/life Can mosquitoes or houseflies transmit coronavirus? “To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,” the World Health Organization says. There’s also no evidence so far suggesting flies can spread coronavirus. Transmission myths & misinformation Can you safely reuse a non-cloth mask that you can’t wash, like a disposable mask? Work/life treatment & prevention Will ingesting or injecting disinfectants, like the ones that kill viruses on surfaces, protect me against coronavirus or kill coronavirus if I already have it? Myths & misinformation treatment & prevention work/life Can coronavirus stick to clothes? Do I need to wash my clothes right after encountering other people, like at the grocery store or while jogging? “I don’t think you need to,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus can stay alive for up to three days on stainless steel and plastic. But clothing “is probably more like cardboard — it’s more absorbent, so the virus is unlikely to stay and last that long,” Gupta said. While coronavirus can stay alive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, viruses generally don’t stick well on surfaces that are in motion. “If you look at how viruses move through air, they kind of want to move around objects,” Gupta said. “They don’t want to necessarily land on objects. So if you’re moving as human body through the air … (it’s) unlikely to stick to your clothes.” Transmission work/life family treatment & prevention Will an antibody test show whether I’m immune and can go back to work or school? Work/life treatment & prevention transmission schools/education Can I use vodka as hand sanitizer? Please don’t. The CDC advises using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Vodka typically contains between 35% and 46% percent alcohol. If the stores are out of hand sanitizer and you want to make your own, the Nebraska Medical Center offers this recipe: What you’ll need: Directions:
In a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.
Add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice). Stir.
Pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal. Write “hand sanitizer” on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle. Myths & misinformation treatment & prevention Are smokers or vapers at higher risk? What if I only smoke weed? This is not a good time to be vaping or smoking anything, including weed. “Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia, which push foreign things out,” said Prof. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control and Education at University of California San Francisco. When you vape, “the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,” Glantz said. Tobacco smokers are at especially high risk. In a study from China, where the first Covid-19 outbreak occurred, smokers were 14 times more likely to develop severe complications than non-smokers. Even occasionally smoking marijuana can put you at greater risk. “What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. “Now you have some airway inflammation, and you get an infection on top of it. So yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.” Work/life family treatment & prevention My teenagers aren’t taking this seriously. Any advice? Coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. It’s killing young, healthy people as well. We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus. Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. “I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” the Iowa teen said. “Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.” Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” Mitchell is now recovering, but has suffered from long-term effects. “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits. And just listen to all the rules and precautions and stay up to date with the news and make sure they’re informed.” Family transmission treatment & prevention myths & misinformation schools/education Does this pandemic have anything to do with the 5G network? No. That’s just a hoax going around the internet. “The theory that 5G might compromise the immune system and thus enable people to get sick from corona is based on nothing,” said Eric van Rongen, chairman of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Learn more about how 5G really works and why this hoax makes no sense. Myths & misinformation My ex and I have joint custody of our kids. Is it safe for them to go between two homes? Ideally, you should limit your children’s potential exposures to coronavirus and work out the safest plan possible with your ex. The problem: Some state and county family courts might be closed, or open only for emergencies involving abuse or endangerment. So it might be difficult to formally modify pre-existing custody agreements. But some states may be offering some flexibility during the pandemic. And there may be creative solutions, such as spending more time with one parent now in exchange for extra time with the other parent after the pandemic ends. Family work/life travel How long does coronavirus stay “alive” on surfaces? Up to three days, depending on the surface. According to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health: Transmission Will a pneumonia or flu vaccine help protect against coronavirus? Some cases of coronavirus do lead to pneumonia. But the pneumonia vaccine won’t help. “Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections,” according to Harvard Medical School. “They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.” Transmission myths & misinformation treatment & prevention vaccine Why is it so difficult to make a drug to cure coronavirus? An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus’ life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce, according to Harvard Medical School. “In addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. And viruses are highly adaptive.” Treatment & Prevention Why have medical workers gotten sick with or died from coronavirus if they’re wearing protective gear? Does the viral load matter? Many health care workers haven’t had enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. “The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.” Transmission How many people with coronavirus don’t have symptoms? Are they still contagious? In one study, about 4 in 5 people with confirmed coronavirus in China were likely infected by people who didn’t know they had it, according to research published in the journal “Science” last year. “These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of (coronavirus) and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging,” researchers wrote. In March 2020, the CDC said almost half of the 712 people with coronavirus who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn’t have any symptoms when they tested positive. Other studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don’t have symptoms. In the US, “I think it could be as many as 1 in 3 walking around asymptomatic,” said New Jersey primary care physician Dr. Alex Salerno. “We have tested some patients that have known exposure to COVID (coronavirus disease). They did not have temperature. Their pulse/(oxygen) was OK.” Salerno said more testing of people without symptoms is essential. When asymptomatic carriers test positive, “we isolate them, and we separate them from the people who are not positive,” Salerno said. If more asymptomatic people got tested, “we could get people back to work safely.” Transmission myths & misinformation work/life If there’s no cure, why go to the hospital unless you have a breathing problem? Most coronavirus patients don’t need to be hospitalized. “The vast majority of people – about 80% – will do well without any specific intervention,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Those patients should get plenty of rest, hydrate frequently and take fever-reducing medication. “The current guidance – and this may change – is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. But about 20% of coronavirus patients get advanced disease. “Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,” the CDC says. The CDC also says you should get immediate help if you have: “This list is not all inclusive,” the CDC says. “Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.” Treatment & prevention family How do I safely take care of someone who’s sick? It may be difficult to know whether your loved one has coronavirus or another illness.
So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: Transmission family What are the symptoms? Fatigue, fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing and the loss of taste or smell are some of the symptoms of Covid-19. Symptoms can appear anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure, the CDC says. But some people get no symptoms at all and can infect others without knowing it. The illness varies in its severity. And while many people can recover at home just fine, some people — including young, previously healthy adults — are suffering long-term symptoms. transmission What can I do if my loved one thinks he or she has coronavirus? Don’t visit family members with suspected illness – connect with them virtually.
If that person lives with you, limit contact with them and avoid using the same bathroom or bedroom if possible, the CDC advises. If the person been diagnosed, he or she might be able to recover at home in isolation. Separate yourself as much as possible from your infected family member and keep animals away, too. Continue to use separate restrooms and regularly disinfect them. Stock up on groceries and household supplies for them while they can’t travel outside and minimize trips to stores. Wash your hands frequently and avoid sharing personal items with the infected person. If you think you’re developing symptoms, stay home and call your physician. family The stores are all out of disinfectant sprays and hand sanitizer. Can I make my own? Yes, you can make both at home. “Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted” if you’re trying to kill coronavirus on a non-porous surface, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC’s recipe calls for diluting 5 tablespoons (or ⅓ cup) of bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water. You can also make your own hand sanitizer. The Nebraska Medical Center – famous for its biocontainment unit and treatment of Ebola patients – offers this recipe: What you’ll need: Directions:
In a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.
Add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice). Stir.
Pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal.
Write “hand sanitizer” on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle. Work/life Treatment & Prevention Can I be fired if I stay home sick? An employee can be fired if they don’t show up to work and don’t have sick leave that would cover the absence, says Krista Slosburg, an employment attorney at Stokes Lawrence in Seattle. But there are exceptions. Employers who make workers with Covid-19 come in may be violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] regulations, said Donna Ballman, who heads an employee advocacy law firm in Florida. Work/Life What happens when workers don’t get paid sick leave? If you work in a city or state that requires sick leave and you use it, you can‘t be terminated or disciplined. But there is no federal mandate that requires companies to offer paid sick leave, and almost a quarter of all US workers don’t get it, according to 2019 government data. Some state and local governments have passed laws that require companies to offer paid sick leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) can sometimes protect a worker’s job in the event they get sick, but it won’t guarantee they get paid while they’re out. Employee advocates urge businesses to consider the special circumstances of the Covid-19, and some already have Work/Life Can managers send a sick worker home? Yes, managers can. The Society for Human Resource Management recommends companies “actively encourage sick employees to stay home, send symptomatic employees home until they are able to return to work safely, and require employees returning from high-risk areas to telework during the incubation period (of 14 days).” If a manager feels an employee’s illness poses a direct threat to colleagues’ safety, the manager may be able to insist the employee be evaluated by a doctor, said Alka Ramchandani-Raj, an attorney specializing in workplace safety. Work/Life If traveling on a plane, how do I stay safe? Since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, many airlines require passengers to wear face masks during the flight, except for while eating or drinking. Health experts suggest eating, drinking and using the restroom before getting on the plane, to eliminate the need to take off your mask or go into a cramped lavatory on board. And always be mindful of where your hands have been, travel medicine specialist Dr. Richard Dawood said. Airport handrails, door handles and airplane lavatory levers are notoriously dirty. “It is OK to touch these things as long as you then wash or sanitize your hands before contaminating your face, touching or handling food,” Dawood said. “Hand sanitizers are great. So are antiseptic hand wipes, which you can also use to wipe down armrests, remote controls at your seat and your tray table.” Travel family work/life What do I do if I think I’m sick? Stay home. Call your doctor to talk about your symptoms and let them know you’re coming for an appointment so they can prepare for your visit, the CDC says. Only a Covid-19 test can diagnose you with coronavirus, but if you suspect you have it, isolate yourself at home. Many patients with coronavirus are able to recover at home. If you’ve been diagnosed and your illness is worsening, seek medical attention promptly. You may need to be monitored in a hospital. Treatment & Prevention Should I spray myself or my kids with disinfectant? No. Those products work on surfaces but can be dangerous to your body. There are some chemical disinfectants, including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces. But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won’t kill it, the World Health Organization says. And those chemicals can harm you. Treatment & Prevention myths & misinformation I’ve heard that home remedies can cure or prevent the virus. Is that true? There’s no evidence from the outbreak that eating garlic, sipping water every 15 minutes or taking vitamin C will protect people from the new coronavirus. Same goes for using essential oils or colloidal silver. Treatment & prevention myths & misinformation Why was the US been so far behind other countries with testing? Experts said cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing forced the US to play catch-up. Problems with public health infrastructure: Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.” Problems with the testing: Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare. Treatment & Prevention If a coronavirus patient gets pneumonia, what antibiotics have proven to be effective? No antibiotics are effective against Covid-19 because the disease is caused by a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. “However, if you are hospitalized for the [coronavirus], you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” the World Health Organization says. There is no known cure for the novel coronavirus. Treatment & Prevention Did Dean Koontz predict this outbreak in the book “The Eyes of Darkness” almost 40 years ago? No. There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. Modern editions of the book call the biological strain “Wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China. But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans. And in the book, the virus had a 100% mortality rate. Early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2-4%. myths & misinformation Can the heat from a hand dryer kill coronavirus? Hand dryers can’t kill the virus, according to WHO. The organization also says that UV lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin. Drinking hot water or taking hot baths won’t kill it, either. Myths & misinformation Can I get coronavirus from a package sent from China? No. “The new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting Covid-19 cases,” the World Health Organization says. “Even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface), it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures,” WHO said.

"Junior Geek of the Month: Orion Razat wrote the book on STEM jokes, and has whale of a new idea",4654,"Orion Razat is a very busy boy. The newly minted twelve-year-old is already an accomplished author working on his second book. He is also an entrepreneur, animator, public speaker, designer and dreamer. Also, add Junior Geek of the Month to the list as the seventh grader received this August award, presented by the Northern Trust in recognition of talented young scientists, innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs in the Pacific Northwest. A prankster in class with a penchant for science, technology, engineering, and math, Orion was inspired by a teacher to combine the two. “The teacher didn’t like it when I told jokes in class,” Orion said. “They understood it was good intention, so they told me to maybe put all of my funny and silly ideas in a book. And then that could be shared at a certain time during class. “ The idea grew into a published book called “101 STEM Jokes,” a mix of geeky STEM word games, fun facts, and activities for kids. “I didn’t necessarily see that coming,” said Orion, who became a published author and sold his book on Amazon. Orion’s mother, Imani Razat, said the love of writing and drawing began at a young age, when Orion was already developing a talent for storytelling. She gave him blank books from the art store, which he filled with stories about his imaginary friends. He started bringing his homemade books to school to share during rug time. In kindergarten he declared himself an author, she said. Orion’s parents encouraged him to stimulate his imagination and share it on YouTube. He learned Adobe After Effects and started a “production company” called Rocketshipsquid. Under the same grip on Instagram, Orion has just unveiled a new t-shirt design that combines his love for chemistry and ice cream. Orion’s journey to becoming a writer has taken him to a variety of publications including Parent Map, STEM Spark Blog, Red Tricycle, and The Week Jr. His animation was projected at the Museum of Museums in Seattle and he was the winner of the University of Washington’s 2020 Neuroscience for Poetry Contest for Children. Orion lived in New York City before his family moved to Seattle four years ago. His father Kaza Razat works in artificial intelligence and founds a startup and chatbot focused on health and wellness. His mother is studying communications at Johns Hopkins University. Orion has a strong interest in transportation and urban planning. He likes to build in “Minecraft” and “Roblox”. Orion Razat’s first book. “It’s a nice way to spend your time creating instead of just mindlessly staring at videos and guys dancing on YouTube,” Orion said. During homeschooling classes with his mother, he uses the Sketch design program to create his own custom traffic maps, form communities, and imagine who has access to transportation and green spaces. Building just cities is an important part of his teaching. And now he’s on book # 2. “I don’t want to give too much away, but it’s like a science fiction novel,” he said before giving up on the project a little more. “The basic premise is that this kid sees a sick whale on the news and tries to help him. And then he builds a device that will allow him to communicate with the whale. The whole world has its eyes fixed on him and the technology he has created, and then the whale speaks at the UN for the oceans. “ Orion said the book is set in the future and will include robots and bullet trains, among other things. He hopes to work with activists and marine biologists to promote the book and its environmental message. His own attitude towards the planet is a mixture of excitement and reluctance. He believes the future could be a really big leap for humanity in terms of technology, but at the same time 2020 is “crazy enough,” he said, and the next 20 years could get even crazier. He doesn’t yet know what he would like to become, but he already understands how to help. “I just want to have a lasting impact on how people see climate change and plastic in the oceans,” Orion said. “I have a feeling that this book could create a certain awareness and cause some kind of change, I hope.” GeekWire will feature a new Junior Geek of the Month in profiles designed to show how they want to have a positive impact on the world through their geeky activities. They also receive special recognition from our project partner Northern Trust. Do you know an extraordinary junior geek aged 12 to 20 who is going to change the world? Submit a nomination.

Judge removes ‘Compassion Seattle’ charter amendment from ballot; initiative aimed to curb homelessness crisis,4926,"Tents will be pitched on a grassy lot along Dexter Avenue in Seattle in January 2021. The Space Needle and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation can be seen in the background. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) A state judge removed the “Compassion Seattle” measure from the November vote on Friday and said the proposal to change the way the city deals with its homeless population goes beyond what the initiative process can legally achieve. King County’s Supreme Court Justice Catherine Shaffer said in a ruling earlier that afternoon that the initiative to amend the city’s statutes was contrary to applicable state law. The judge said that while voters would welcome the city council’s mandates to build more housing and clear tent camps, such specific requirements were not the purpose of the amendments to the statutes. “You can’t change a city charter to conflict with state law,” Shaffer said. “I like this amendment to the statutes as a voter. But it cannot stand as a judge. “ Proponents of the measure, who said there was no time to appeal, criticized the judge’s reasoning. “Although we are pleased that Judge Shaffer said she would have voted for Amendment 29 to the Charter if, given that option, we resolutely disagreed with her ruling today, which denies Seattle voters the opportunity to vote on the matter Number one to hear our city, “said a spokesman for supporters of the initiative. “This ruling means that the public can only change the city’s current approach to homelessness if those responsible in town hall are changed.” Compassion Seattle, which had already qualified for the November vote, called on the city to provide 2,000 emergency or permanent housing within a year and to ensure that parks, playgrounds and sidewalks remain free of storage when the accommodation and services are not available are available. The initiative would also require the city to “keep parks, playgrounds, sports fields, public squares and sidewalks and streets free of camps” once the mandatory housing, drug and mental health services are in place. The Los Angeles City Council is constantly pushing for similar rules to be introduced. The debate over the measure comes at exactly the same time that major employers like Amazon are bringing workers back to their headquarters in Seattle’s business district, which has been hardest hit by the homelessness crisis. Compassion Seattle had good poll numbers and an approval rating of 65%, according to its supporters. However, opponents of the measure, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, argued that the measure criminalized homelessness and exceeded the intended scope of constitutional amendments by bypassing the city council and establishing specific policies that should be controlled by the city. It was the ACLU, along with the Seattle / King County Coalition on Homelessness and the Transit Riders Union, that successfully sued earlier this month for removing the measure from the ballot. “Judge Shaffer’s ruling affirms established limits to the local initiative process and recognizes the importance of the proper functioning of our democratic systems,” said Breanne Schuster, Washington attorney’s ACLU, in a statement. “We are pleased that CA 29 is not an obstacle to solutions that address our housing crisis sensibly and that do not punish people for trying to meet their basic life support needs such as shelter, sleep and food.” Supporters of the initiative urged their supporters to pay attention to which candidates they supported and which not in the upcoming mayor and two city council elections. In the mayor’s race of Seattle, former Council President Bruce Harrell meets current Council President Lorena Gonzalez. In the two council races for the At-Large seats, Nikita Oliver competes against Sara Nelson. The other competition is Teresa Mosqueda versus Kenneth Wilson. “We urge the public not to give up the fight. We can still make our voices heard in the mayor, city council and city attorney elections, ”said a Compassion Seattle spokesman. “In each race, the difference between candidates is defined by who supports what the Charter Amendment was trying to achieve and who does not.” Tim Burgess, a former city council president and former interim mayor of Seattle who helped shape the poll, called it a “compassionate, results-oriented plan of action” in a citizens’ talk hosted by GeekWire. Tim Burgess (bottom left), Rachel Smith (top right), Kieran Snyder (bottom right) and presenter Mike Lewis from GeekWire But no matter how well-intentioned, critics said the initiative process is the wrong tool for solving the problem. “We are grateful that this ruling will prevent misleading and illegal use of the powers of local electoral initiatives,” said Katie Wilson of the Transit Riders Union in a statement. “It is important that voters understand exactly what to weigh, and CA 29 makes promises it cannot keep.”"
Intelligence Review Yields No Firm Conclusion on Origins of Virus,4430,"WASHINGTON – American intelligence agencies have been unable to determine whether the coronavirus pandemic was the result of an accidental leak from a laboratory or whether it occurred more naturally, according to released parts of a report released to the White House on Friday. The country’s espionage agencies, according to the office of the director of the National Intelligence Service, are unlikely to draw any conclusions without further cooperation from China or new sources of information. In a statement, President Biden said the United States would continue to work to understand the origins of the virus and urged China to be more transparent about what caused the virus to show up there in late 2019, before quickly spreading to the world spread across the world. “We will do everything in our power to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world so that we can take all necessary precautions to prevent it from reoccurring,” said Biden. “The People’s Republic of China has critical information about the origins of this pandemic, but from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it.” As debates about the origins of the pandemic and China’s role intensified, Mr Biden directed the country’s intelligence services to produce a report on the source of the virus three months ago. Following the review, the National Intelligence Council and four other elements of the intelligence community reported that they believe the virus that causes Covid-19 was most likely caused by “natural exposure to an infected animal from an infected animal or a nearby precursor virus.” . Before the review was conducted, only two agencies favored the natural exposure theory. However, the new report said the Intelligence Council and other agencies advocating natural theory had little confidence in its conclusions – a sign that the intelligence behind the assessment was not strong and that the conclusions could change. On the other side of the debate, an agency with moderate confidence said it had concluded that the pandemic was the result of a “laboratory-associated incident” in China. According to the released report, analysts at this agency stressed the risky nature of working on coronaviruses. The agency also said the accident likely involved “experimentation, animal treatment, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology”. Before the pandemic, there were two laboratories in Wuhan working on the coronavirus, but intelligence services have mainly focused on the work of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The announcement by the director of the National Intelligence Service did not identify the agency advocating the laboratory leak theory. However, current and former officials said the FBI believe the virus was created in the laboratory. A former official said the office believed the virus was likely leaked to the public by laboratory technicians. Intelligence agencies all agree that the virus is unlikely to be developed as a biological weapon, the same stance the US government has taken for more than a year. The agencies also agree that the first exposures that caused the outbreak occurred “no later than November 2019”, according to the released conclusions. Central to the debate over the origin of the virus, American intelligence officials don’t believe Chinese officials knew about it at the time of the outbreak, the report said. “The IC assumes that China’s officials had no prior knowledge of the virus prior to the first Covid-19 outbreak,” the released report reads, using the initials for the intelligence community. The three-month review ordered by Mr Biden was carried out to bring more scientific expertise into the investigation into the origins of the pandemic. The secret services used the three months to investigate a treasure trove of data that had not yet been combed through completely. These data, taken from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, did not provide any additional information to convince other authorities that a laboratory leak was possible. Mr Biden said the United States would continue to work with other nations and the World Health Organization to get access to more information from China. “We need to have a full and transparent account of this global tragedy,” he said. “Nothing less is acceptable.”"
Best water bottles of 2021,12253,"
CNN
—   With an endless stream of water bottles making numerous claims about technological innovations and insulating properties flowing into the market, it’s easy to get lost in all the options. To determine which bottles are truly worth their price tag, we culled thousands of insulated water bottles down to 15 contenders after reading through reviews and browsing bestselling bottles across the internet. We then put them through a litany of tests to determine which is the absolute best. (For more on our testing process, scroll down.) After two months of testing and drinking a whole lotta water, we narrowed down our picks to two bottles that stood out from the rest. Best overall water bottle The Yeti Rambler came out on top during our testing thanks to its stellar thermoregulation, amazing durability and fantastic chug cap that gives you a comfortable and quick drinking experience, while maintaining easy access to the superwide mouth. Best budget water bottle The 21-ounce Healthy Human Stein was a surprise standout in our testing for its durability and effective thermoregulation. We didn’t love the lid, but you can add the optional Flip n’ Sip lid to make the drinking experience easier. Plus, it comes in a dizzying range of colors and three sizes to fit most tastes and needs. Kai Burkhardt/CNN 26-Ounce Yeti Rambler While the Yeti Rambler is a bit on the pricier side, this water bottle is easily the best one we tested. Not only does it keep your drinks hot or cold for hours and hours, it’s solidly durable and has the best lid we’ve ever tested. Plus, the Rambler is customizable, available in 14 colors and five sizes (12-ounce, 18-ounce, 26-ounce, 36-ounce and 46-ounce) and it’s even dishwasher-safe. While there are other bottles with great insulation that are reasonably durable, what pushes the Rambler past any other option on the market in our eyes is its standard-issue chug cap. This lid is made of two components: one that screws into the bottle and contains a spout, and another that twists on top of that to keep it protected. This two-tiered system means that whenever you want to take a swig of water, you can unscrew the top and chug away out of the spout. But when it’s time to refill your bottle with water and ice, you can take the whole contraption off, revealing the Yeti’s ultrawide mouth. Kai Burkhardt/CNN The Yeti Rambler’s Chug Cap Other bottles we tested offered spout lids, but those often must be purchased separately, and none of them worked as seamlessly as the Rambler’s. The Rambler easily had the easiest drinking and filling experience out of all the bottles we tested thanks to this lid, which also retained little to no coffee flavor after our tests. Best of all, we love that with the Rambler you don’t have to give up much on aesthetics to get top-notch performance. The Yeti bottle comes in a bunch of bold, stylish colors, including a light blue, an olive green and even an eye-catching pink. What’s more, starting at an extra $5 you can customize your bottle with all sorts of designs from plain text and monograms to state emblems and even logos you upload yourself. The Yeti Rambler strikes the perfect balance between being a sturdy, insulated bottle that you can take on your roughest adventures while still looking good when it’s standing on your desk. Its customizability, ease of cleaning and ingenious chug cap are all reasons why no matter where you go, we think you’ll love having a Yeti Rambler at your side. Kai Burkhardt/CNN 21-Ounce Healthy Human Stein Hovering around $20 depending on which color you choose, this water bottle from Healthy Human was one of the top bottles we’ve tested. Its counterpart, the Healthy Human Curve, actually won our overall best spot last year. The Curve has had some issues with stock and is sometimes hard to find, but luckily the Stein is basically the same bottle as the Curve, just without the wavy design, which helped the bottle’s ergonomics but was a love-it-or-hate-it from the aesthetics side. Along with the other bottles we tested this year, the Healthy Human did an excellent job at retaining temperature, especially over our shorter time intervals. Plus, during our first batch of testing it scored the highest out of all the bottles we tested for durability. After dropping it on its bottom as well as on its lid, the bottle barely showed signs of abuse, aside from some paint chipping on the bottom. It was one of the only contenders that didn’t turn into a wobbly vessel that could barely stand up. Coming in at 21 ounces, its success during the drop test may have been due to it being one of the lighter options, though the 26-ounce Yeti and other smaller bottles we tested didn’t perform as well when given the same treatment. Where the Stein falls a tad short is its lid and mouth. The mouth isn’t nearly as big as the Rambler’s, so while filling up the bottle isn’t a chore, it’s definitely harder to get ice in as quickly as you can with the Yeti. The lid comes equipped with a carabiner and didn’t retain any bitterness after our coffee test; however, it’s a simple screw-on lid, so you drink directly from the bottle’s mouth instead of from a spout. You can, however, buy the Healthy Human Flip n’ Sip lid for an extra $14.99, which makes the drinking experience much better. The Stein comes in 39 different color options and three sizes (16-ounce, 21-ounce and 32-ounce), with different availability depending on the size you choose. The selection isn’t limited to base colors like other bottles, and includes fun designs such as Mirage, Willow Oak and more. The Healthy Human Stein also comes in recyclable packaging, which is nice for those motivated to buy a reusable bottle to reduce plastic waste. The Healthy Human Stein is a solid bottle that can keep your drinks hot or cold for as long as you need and won’t immediately dent or break when you drop it. Its lid isn’t the best, but its color selection and remarkably low price make it a bottle worth buying. For our 2021 update, we retested a handful of top-performing water bottles, conducting another round of thermoregulation tests and adding a coffee test to see if the bottles or lids retained any bitterness after being washed. Most bottles we tested had similar thermoregulation abilities, so we measured over a shorter period of time in this year’s tests to mimic everyday behavior. In our original testing, we measured hot water after 12 hours and cold water after 24, but this time we cut down the testing time to six hours for hot and 12 for cold since you (hopefully) won’t be drinking nine-hour-old coffee, and if you’re keeping up on your daily intake of water, it should definitely be time for a refill before the 24-hour mark. Since the top-tier bottles have similar thermoregulation abilities, we paid more attention to things that will affect your experience on a day-to-day basis like durability and drinkability. Our two winners were the two most durable bottles we’ve ever tested, both coming out relatively unscathed after being dropped three times onto concrete. We spent hours testing all 15 water bottles to make sure they met the demands of everyday use. That meant testing how long they keep water cold, how long they keep water hot, how they fare during a drop, how easy they are to drink from and so much more. Here’s a breakdown of what we tested and how we did it: Performance Durability Portability S’well 25-Ounces ($45; swell.com) We previously named the S’well bottle the best bottle for holding temperature, but after reconsidering how you’d use a water bottle in a day-to-day capacity, figured that whether a bottle can retain temperature better than others over 24 hours isn’t as important as durability and drinkability. Because of that, the S’well bottle dropped a bit in our rankings because it got extremely dented in our drop tests, and its small mouth means it’s a lot harder to clean, and filling it up with normal ice is basically impossible. Klean Kanteen TKWide ($39.95; kleankanteen.com) The wide-mouth version of Klean Kanteen solves the small-mouth problem on the standard Klean Kanteen bottle (which we also tested), and touts a large lid and a sturdier body. It performed amazingly in the original cold water test, coming in second behind the S’well, but didn’t do as well with hot water. If you’re not into the Yeti or the Healthy Human, the Klean Kanteen TKWide would be our next pick. Hydro Flask Wide Mouth ($44.95; hydroflask.com) A Hydro Flask is a Hydro Flask. If you’re already set on buying one, you won’t be disappointed, but we just don’t think it’s the best option out there. It’s a great-looking bottle, but its performance wasn’t on par with many of the other options we tried. The biggest warning we’d give is not to drop the Wide Mouth version on its lid, because it popped right off and spilled water everywhere during our tests. The first time this happened we thought it could be a faulty lid, but after a second lid had the same problem, we decided to pin it on poor design. Hydro Flask Standard Mouth ($34.95; hydroflask.com) The Standard performed equally if not better than the Wide. Plus, it’s smaller, which means less weight to carry around. You can’t pour ice in as fast, but the smaller opening also means it’s easier to drink from. Just be careful about drops. After our tests it got so damaged it lost its insulation abilities. Klean Kanteen Classic ($39.95; kleankanteen.com) This Klean Kanteen had stellar performances with thermoregulation. The biggest downsides were the small mouth (with a weirdly tiny lid) and the fact that the body got so damaged it caused the insulation technology to fail. CamelBak Chute Mag ($36; camelbak.com) This bottle performed quite well, especially with thermoregulation. The lid has a little magnet so it doesn’t hit you in the face while you drink. Its biggest downside: The cap broke off when we dropped it. CamelBak Carry Cap ($36; camelbak.com) If you’re considering CamelBak, go with the Chute Mag over the Carry Cap. The lid on the Carry Cap has a big loop, which is nice to hold, but it snapped off pretty easily during the drops. Miir Bottle ($29.95; miir.com) The Miir also did well in thermoregulation, outdoing both the Yeti and Sigg. However, it lost favor during the drop test, when the lid broke on the first drop. We didn’t test wide-mouth Miir bottles, only the standard. If you’re careful, Miir is a great option for a smaller, portable bottle. Sigg Hot and Cold One Thermo Flask ($35.15; amazon.com) This bottle performed well during the temperature tests, just about matching the Yeti Rambler. It’s a good-looking bottle featuring a lid with a locking mechanism and a built-in tea filter. Where it really fell apart was when we dropped it on that lid. It broke on the first drop. You can normally order replacement lids (though they’re out of stock now), but compared to the other bottles it just wasn’t sturdy enough. Snow Peak Kanpai Bottle ($79.95; amazon.com) This bottle is beautiful, scoring the highest in pure design. But it’s also expensive and scored the lowest in our testing, especially in thermoregulation, where it had the third-worst score after the Takeyas. The lid shattered on the drop test. Stanley Easy Clean ($23.59, originally $25; amazon.com) This bottle performed rather well in keeping water cold, but not nearly as well with hot water. The lid also fared really well during the drops, but the body got large dents on the bottom. What brought its score down were the little things: not as many sizes, lids or color options; it was on the heavier side; and it wasn’t as easy to carry. Takeya Standard ($24.99, originally $29.99; amazon.com) The Takeya bottle underperformed with thermoregulation. The cap features a nifty little spout for fast drinking that unscrews to reveal a wide mouth, but it just wasn’t enough to overcome the poor insulation. Takeya Active ($34.99; amazon.com) The Active is basically the same as the Takeya Standard, with a few nice improvements. Most notably is the rubber boot on the bottom, which is well worth the extra $5 if you want to buy a Takeya. While it didn’t completely eradicate dents, it made a big difference and prevented any paint chipping on the bottom."
Death sentence for Charleston church shooter upheld,2373,"RICHMOND, Virginia – The U.S. Fourth Court of Appeals has upheld the death sentence of Dylann Roof, the white racist responsible for the 2015 Charleston Church massacre. Roof appealed his conviction and death sentence in January 2020, arguing that he had schizophrenia and other mental disorders. On his appeal, Roof’s attorneys argued that he was wrongly allowed to represent himself during the sentencing, a critical phase of his trial. Roof successfully prevented the jury from hearing evidence of his mental health, “under the delusion,” his lawyers argued that “he would be bailed out of prison by white nationalists – but bizarrely, only if he got his mental impairments out of the public eye.” Recording.” Roof was convicted of gunning down nine people during a Bible study on June 17, 2015 at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. In 2017, Roof became the first person in the United States to be sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities said Roof opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study in the church and rained dozens of bullets on the crowd. He was 21 at the time. The 4th District determined that the trial judge had made no mistake in determining that Roof was qualified to stand trial and issued a damning reprimand for Roof’s crimes. “Dylann Roof murdered African Americans in their church, during their Bible study and worship. They had welcomed him. He slaughtered her. He did so with the express intention of not only terrorizing his immediate victims in the historically significant Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as they would learn of the mass murder, “wrote the panel in its judgment. The appeals court released its statement on Wednesday that the conclusion was the result of a “thorough analysis process” and not “a product of emotion”. “No cold record or careful analysis of laws and precedents can capture the full horror of what Roof did,” the statement said. “His crimes qualify him for the harshest punishment a fair society can inflict.” Emanuel AME in Charleston is the oldest black church in the south. During his federal trial, prosecutors said Roof told FBI agents he wanted the shootings to bring back racial segregation or start a racial war. Contribution: The Associated Press Follow Daniel J.

‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ wants you to know it’s okay to like ‘Voyager’,5953,"This article contains minor spoilers for season two, episode three of ‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’. This week’s episode of Lower Decks, “We’ll Always Have Tom Paris” manages to put two references in its title: an episode from the first season of The Next Generation called “We’ll Always Have Paris” and the name of one Main cast member of Star Trek: Voyager, Lieutenant Tom Eugene Paris. But apart from that clever play on words, the title also has a deeper meaning: as much as we want to forget about the more embarrassing moments of the Star Trek franchise, they happened anyway, and they weren’t all bad. Even, and most importantly, Voyager. CBS Audience reactions to Voyager have been quite polarized in the 26 years since it premiered. In the 90s, many fans were looking forward to seeing a “real” Star Trek show again, which took place on a constantly exploring ship, in contrast to the comparatively stationary political drama of Deep Space Nine. But chunky writing spoiled many people’s opinions of Voyager, and towards the end of its life the show was more known for the skin-tight outfits from Seven of Nine and the list of guest stars of the week, including Jason Alexander and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. After the show aired, the franchise stopped moving forward in its timeline, decided to explore the founding of Starfleet in Enterprise, and completely restart the entire universe with the 2009 Star Trek film. While fans were thrown a bone with a brief cameo from Admiral Kathryn Janeway in the final TNG-era film, Nemesis, Voyager essentially disappeared from the Star Trek canon until the appearance of Seven of Nine in episode four of Picard . Draws Patton Picard had its advantages for fans of The Next Generation: We were allowed to see Troi and Riker as a family and Data got a better farewell to the afterlife. But it was anything but positive for fans of Voyager, with the death of a minor character and a rather gloomy existence for fan favorite Seven of Nine. Star Trek: Lower Decks is turning back the clock a bit as it takes place a year after the events of Nemesis, making it our first real look at the immediate future of the Star Trek universe after TNG, DS9, and Voyager. The Dominion War is over, Romulus is under a new regime, and the crew of the USS Voyager are basically celebrities after seven years in the Delta Quadrant; Picard is set almost twenty years later when the glitz would have gone. Matt Kennedy Everything here is just shiny and new and deserves plaques – a bit strange to exist in a post-scarcity culture, but this is a comedy series after all. And in this week’s B-Plot, Brad Boimler wants one of his records to be signed by a special guest on the USS Cerritos: Tom Paris. Or, as Brad refers to the former Voyager crew member, “Creator of Fairhaven, Captain Proton himself,” and the first human to break the transwarp barrier. That is a straight reference to three of the silliest, weirdest, and some say the worst episodes of Star Trek: Voyager. And just in case you forgot what was so bad the last one, Mariner asks “Is he still a salamander?” Because that’s one thing that happened in the episode “Threshold”. Unimpressed (and perhaps even encouraged) by the madness, Boimler is very excited to meet his hero. Even after the ship’s system doesn’t recognize him and won’t let him through any doors, he takes the Jefferies tubes to make his way to the bridge to meet Lt. To meet Paris. In a way, it feels like a metaphor for how the fandom thinks about Star Trek: Voyager now. While everyone admits there were a lot of stupid moments, these actually made it more lovable. The famous line “There’s coffee in that nebula” inspired astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti to bring a replica uniform and wear it on a mission in 2015: And who can forget the infamous “Tuvix” episode, in which crew members Tuvok and Neelix were merged into one being in a van accident? Although the resulting person was healthy and happy, the decision was made to force him to split back into his individual characters, which inspired the recent internet rally scream “Janeway murdered Tuvix”. Even Janeway actress Kate Mulgrew entered the debate, responding to a tweet from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When politicians are involved, this is no longer a fandom joke. Maybe it’s time to give Voyager a little more credit. It’s not as good as TNG or DS9, but it still has its fair share of fans. I remember a time when it looked like it was constantly running on Spike TV (now the Paramount Network) as opposed to Deep Space Nine, which is seldom repeated due to its serialized nature. Last year I sat down and re-watched the entire Star Trek franchise, including Voyager, and watched some episodes that I missed the first time around. I found myself enjoying some of it, flinching just as often, and finally remembering why I hadn’t seen the show when it first aired some time ago. In general, I feel that the show’s biggest problem was its missed potential, like the way the conflict between Starfleet and Maquis crew members was quickly resolved, how many of their cast members were underutilized, and why Harry Kim was never promoted. CBS However, it is not the job of Lower Decks to declare or redeem Voyager. Boimler and Tom Paris are just the B-plot here, with the episode’s main drive being Tendi and Mariner’s mission to get a package for Doctor T’Ana, as well as Rutherford’s quest to find out how a certain dead officer was brought back to life is . The episode just prompts us to think about what it would be like to be a Starfleet officer and hear about all of Voyager’s adventures in the Delta Quadrant. Strange and Silly? Yes sir.

"In First Interview From Jail, an Upbeat Navalny Discusses Prison Life",8779,"MOSCOW – Russia’s most famous prisoner, opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, spends a lot of time tidying up his cell block, reading letters and attending mass for dinner, with porridge often on the menu. But perhaps the most terrifying thing, he said, is being forced to watch Russian state television and selected propaganda films for more than eight hours a day. “Reading, writing or anything else” is forbidden, Navalny said of the forced screen time. “You have to sit in a chair and watch TV.” And when an inmate nods off, he says, the guards shout: “Don’t sleep, watch out!” In an interview with the New York Times, his first interview with a news agency since his arrest in January, Mr. Navalny spoke about his life in prison, why Russia cracked down on opposition and dissidents, and his belief that “ Putin’s regime, “as he calls it, is doomed to collapse. Mr Navalny founded a major opposition movement to expose high-level corruption and challenge President Vladimir V. Putin in the elections. He was arrested in March after returning to Russia from Germany, knowing he had faced a probation violation because of a conviction in a politically motivated case. As was well documented at the time, he was out of the country for medical treatment after being poisoned by Russian agents with the chemical weapon Novichok, according to Western governments. Mr. Navalny has not been completely silent since his imprisonment in penal colony No. 2 east of Moscow. He has occasionally sent out social media posts through his lawyers, who visit him regularly. Nor is he actively silenced by the Kremlin. When asked about Mr Navalny’s presence on social media on Tuesday, Putin’s spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov said it was “not our business” for Mr Navalny to speak. But the written exchange of questions and answers on 54 handwritten pages is by far the most comprehensive and extensive presentation. In today’s Russia, Navalny made it clear that the hours he spent watching state television programs and films selected by the overseer were the experience of a political prisoner, a status that Amnesty International has granted Navalny. Gone are the relocations of heavy workers in mining or forestry and the agitation by criminals and guards that characterized the Soviet gulag for political prisoners. “You can imagine tattooed muscle men with steel teeth going on with knife fights to conquer the best cot by the window,” said Navalny. “You have to imagine something like a Chinese labor camp, where everyone is marching in a row and video cameras are hung up everywhere. There is constant control and a culture of obsession. “ Despite his circumstances, Navalny was optimistic about Russia’s future prospects and outlined his strategy for achieving political change through the electoral system even in an authoritarian state. “The Putin regime is a historic accident, not an inevitability,” he wrote, adding, “It was the choice of the corrupt Yeltsin family,” a reference to the appointment of Mr Putin as incumbent president in December by former President Boris N Yeltsin 1999. “Sooner or later this mistake will be corrected and Russia will embark on a democratic, European path of development. Simply because people want that. “ As before, Mr Navalny criticized Europe and the United States for the economic sanctions Russia has imposed for its foreign interference and repression of dissidents, including Mr Navalny. He said sanctions harm ordinary Russians and risk alienating a broad constituency within Russia that is a natural ally. Sanctions should only target the top oligarchs backing Putin’s government, rather than the dozen of largely unknown personalities that have been hit so far. The really powerful have largely avoided sanctions by holding back “an army of lawyers, lobbyists and bankers who fight for the right of owners of dirty and bloody money to go unpunished”. During the 20th century and earlier, Russia’s prison was a melting pot that forged or broke dissidents and writers, shaped leaders, and shattered pluralist politics. The modern experience of a Russian political prisoner, Navalny said, is primarily “psychological violence,” with numbing screen time playing a major role. Mr. Navalny described five daily television sessions for inmates, the first starting immediately after morning gymnastics, breakfast, and sweeping the yard. After some free time, there is two hours in front of the screen, lunch, then more screen time, dinner and then more TV time in the evening. During an afternoon session, chess or backgammon is an acceptable alternative. “We watch films about the Great Patriotic War,” said Navalny, referring to World War II, “or how one day, 40 years ago, our athletes defeated the Americans or Canadians.” During these sessions, he said: “I understand most clearly the essence of the ideology of the Putin regime: the present and the future are replaced by the past – the truly heroic past, or the embellished past, or the entirely fictional past. All kinds of pasts have to be in the spotlight all the time in order to suppress thoughts of the future and questions about the present. “ The protracted, forced television approach taken to extremes in Penal Colony No. 2 is not unique to the place previously detained in politically tainted cases. It emerged from a penal reform that began in Russia in 2010 to strengthen guards’ control over inmates and reduce the influence of prison gangs. The intent is less brainwashing than control, say Russian prison system experts. “Everything is organized in such a way that I have maximum control 24 hours a day,” said Mr Navalny. He said he was not attacked or threatened by fellow inmates, but estimated that around a third in Russian prisons are known as “activists” serving as informants for the warden. During his first few weeks in the penal colony, Mr. Navalny was numb, either from the persistent effects of the poisoning or from a back injury from driving in a prison car. He also went on a 24-day hunger strike, which worried his health. His neurological symptoms subsided when the guards stopped waking him hourly at night, supposedly to make sure he was not planning to escape. “I now understand why sleep deprivation is one of the most popular torture methods used by the special services,” he said. “No trace is left and it is impossible to tolerate.” He said he got on well with other inmates and that they sometimes cook snacks in the microwave. “When we cook, I always remember the classic scene from ‘Goodfellas’ when the Mafia bosses cook pasta in a prison cell,” he said. “Unfortunately we don’t have such a cool pot and pasta is forbidden. Still, it’s fun. “ Mr Navalny, 45, admitted that at a turbulent time when the government cracked down on the opposition and the news media, he was struggling to remain visible in Russian politics. The protests that broke out after the controversial elections in Belarus last year shocked the Kremlin, he said. The other concern of the Putin government is the electoral strategy he has developed, which he describes as “intelligent voting”. According to the strategy, Mr Navalny’s organization supports the candidates who, in their opinion, can win in the regional and parliamentary elections that will take place next month. The Kremlin was so concerned about the upcoming elections, he said, that this year it cracked down on not only its group and other activists, but also moderate opposition politicians, civil society groups and independent news outlets like Meduza, Proekt and Dozhd TV. Mr Navalny suggested that while the raid might prove to be a tactical success for Mr Putin, it could also be a long-term burden. “Putin has solved his tactical question: we must not take the majority from the Duma,” said Navalny of the lower house of the Russian parliament. “But for that he had to completely change the political system, move to a fundamentally different, much harder level of authoritarianism.” Mr Navalny suggested that the move highlighted a major weakness in Mr Putin’s political system. While left and nationalists are represented by parties loyal to Putin, there is no stable, Kremlin-friendly center-right party representing the country’s rising middle class of relatively wealthy, urban-living Russians. “In Russia there is no opposition because Aleksei Navalny or someone else commands it from headquarters,” said Navalny, “but because about 30 percent of the country – mainly the educated, urban population – has no political representation.” When what he called the reactionary anomaly of Putin’s rule fades, Russia will return to democratic governance, Navalny said. “We are specific, like any nation, but we are Europe. We are the West. “ Julian E. Barnes contributed the reporting from Washington."
"Inspired by Airbnb, Hims & Hers offers 10,000 free medical visits to displaced Afghan refugees – TechCrunch",2144,"Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum said Thursday his company was in the process of distributing 10,000 primary care and mental health visits to displaced Afghan refugees. Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Hims & Hers has built a multi-specialty telemedicine platform connecting consumers with licensed healthcare professionals. In one blog entry, Dudum wrote that Hims & Hers felt a “moral responsibility to act – and act quickly”. He added: “The eyes and hearts of the world are currently and understandably on Afghanistan and the refugees who have been evacuated in large numbers. These people are looking for the most basic needs. “ Dudum said that Hims & Hers plans to work with selected NGOs, non-profit organizations and other relevant partners, including translators and providers on its platform, “to ensure that refugees are aware of these services and receive much-needed support”. The visits are immediately available to refugees. The CEO also said that Hims & Hers will pay for the doctor’s visits, but that they will be “provided by the generous vendors” through its platform. on Twittersaid Dudum the move was inspired by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky last announcement that his company planned to offer free temporary housing to 20,000 Afghan refugees around the world during the Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan. Photo credits: Twitter The company’s initiatives come at a time when tens of thousands of people are trying to flee Afghanistan. In the midst of the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to help refugees from the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Since the beginning of this week, the countries had around 58,700 people evacuated since mid-August from the state capital Kabul. While Hims & Hers has evolved into a telehealth platform, it also sells sexual wellness and other health products and services to millennials.

Delta variant in US has entered deadlier phase: COVID updates,8152,"As the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on Monday, America’s delta-driven surge in COVID-19 has entered a more deadly phase. Cases are rising in 42 states, the lowest number in six weeks. But deaths are now rising in 43 states – the worst record since December, ahead of America’s deadliest month of the pandemic, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths in the US for the week ending Monday was 7,225. By comparison, about 5,400 Americans died in the Pearl Harbor and September 11th attacks combined. The face of the dying also changes quickly. Deaths are increasingly centered in white non-Hispanic people, an analysis by USA TODAY of data from the National Centers for Health Statistics shows. Most other races and ethnic groups now have lower proportions of deaths, but white non-Hispans, who account for about 61.1% of all deaths during the pandemic, accounted for 68.8% of the deaths reported so far in July and August. Meanwhile, the proportion of deaths among young people is also increasing, with the numbers of 30-year-olds and 18-29 year olds roughly tripling their share of deaths in July and August, according to preliminary figures from the Centers for the Control and Prevention of Show diseases. People between 50 and early 60s make less than 1 in 6 victims of the pandemic, but in July and August they make up more than 1 in 4. – Mike Stucka Also on the news: ►Kentucky will send National Guard members to hospitals overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients and facing shortages of care, Governor Andy Beshear said Monday.

Today’s numbers: In the United States, there have been nearly 38 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 629,800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The global totals: More than 212.8 million cases and 4.44 million deaths. According to the CDC, more than 171 million Americans – 51.5% of the population – have been fully vaccinated.

Leading pediatricians said loudly and unanimously on Monday that doctors shouldn’t prescribe COVID-19 vaccines to children under the age of 12. With the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine fully approved by the FDA, such off-label use is now legal. But it’s definitely not a good idea, said several experts. “We don’t have any data on young children, so this should really be a no-go,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University. Yet while the American Academy of Pediatrics agreed that children should not be vaccinated yet, the group is also calling on the FDA to speed up the process of approving vaccinations for children under the age of 12 by relying on early study data rather than more complete ones Waiting for results. In the week up to August 19, around 180,000 children and adolescents were infected with COVID-19, practically all of them with the Delta variant, the AAP announced on Monday. Since the U.S. pandemic began, nearly 4.6 million minors have been infected – 12% of the total – and rates have quadrupled in the last month alone, reaching roughly the same level as last winter’s increase. Hospital stays and child deaths remain low. – Karen Weintraub When FDA approval and additional vaccine mandates were announced on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious disease expert, said the measures could help the US get the disease under control by next year. “If we can get through this winter and really get the majority – the overwhelming majority – of the 90 million people who haven’t been vaccinated, I hope we can get good control in the spring of 2022,” Fauci told CNN. After the FDA granted full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, companies, schools, and governments included CVS, the University of Michigan, Chevron, the city of Chicago and New York, and New Jersey public schools a new vaccine announced requirements for some or all of their employees. President Joe Biden also urged corporations, nonprofits, government agencies and schools to “increase vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people.” Health officials are warning against using a drug called ivermectin for unapproved use as a medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19. The drug, which was only approved as an anti-parasitic treatment for humans and animals such as cattle and horses, has been the subject of a surge in calls to the Mississippi Poison Control Center. The drugs made for humans are different from those made for livestock, which are “highly concentrated, toxic to humans and can cause serious harm,” the Mississippi State Department of Health said in a warning on Monday. At least two people were hospitalized with potential ivermectin toxicity after taking the drug made for farm animals, the state poison control center said Monday. Interest in the drug is growing as the delta variant of the coronavirus has led to higher COVID-19 transmission rates and increased concern among vaccinated people about infection. Multiple reports of patients being treated or hospitalized after “self-medication with ivermectin for horses” prompted the FDA to issue a warning on Friday. “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, all of you. Stop it,” said the agency on Twitter. Hawaii Governor David Ige urges tourists not to visit the popular vacation destination until October as the number of COVID cases increases and the state’s hospitals are busy. “It is not a good time to travel to the islands,” he said at a press conference on Monday. That doesn’t mean travelers can’t visit Hawaii because the state hasn’t tightened its entry requirements. Since October, travelers have been able to present a negative COVID test to bypass the state’s strict quarantine. In July there is no compulsory test for vaccinated travelers. There has been speculation that the testing requirement would return from the Delta variant due to the surge in COVID cases, but Ige said it was difficult as the CDC says domestic travel is safe for vaccinated travelers. Dorothy Oliver runs a general store out of a white trailer in Panola, Alabama, the only place you can shop for miles. She’s not afraid to ask her clients about their vaccination status and allay their concerns. When the COVID-19 vaccine became widely available, the closest clinics to offer it were about 40 minutes away by car. Oliver said she wanted to simplify the process, so she volunteered to help set up appointments and drive her clients to and from locations. “Many of them had a lot of doubts and many of them were thrilled to have someone to help them,” said Oliver. There are approximately 350 people in the Panola area, and according to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community are unvaccinated. She keeps a slowly dwindling list of them.

Zulily co-founders Darrell Cavens and Mark Vadon invest in ID verification tech startup Vouched,3216,"Vouched investor Darrell Cavens (left) and Vouched CEO John Baird. (Verified photo) Vouched, a Seattle-based startup helping companies verify identity, has raised $ 4.5 million from investors including Darrell Cavens and Mark Vadon, co-founders of e-commerce giant Zulily. It’s a vote of confidence in the three-year-old company that emerged from Madrona Venture Labs, the Seattle-based accelerator for the Madrona Venture Group. Cavens was CEO of Zulily, which was sold to QVC parent Liberty Interactive in 2015 for $ 2.4 billion. Previously, he invested in Vouched and headed the most recent round. “The world is getting more digital every day, and security is an issue that every business and consumer is focused on,” Cavens told GeekWire. “Solutions that go beyond simple verifications and passwords are the future – and Vouched can play a key role in this.” Vouched uses artificial intelligence to help 150+ companies from a wide variety of industries verify the identity of their customers, clients, and contractors. Its software analyzes images of photo IDs, including passports and driver’s licenses. The technology compares a user’s selfie to confirm identity. It also examines text such as addresses. The idea is to provide real-time fraud detection to a person. Use cases include KYC (Know Your Customer) in banking; Employment screening; Gig economy setting; contactless hotel check-in; and more. Vouched aims to do for ID verification what services like Stripe did for online payments. There are a variety of competitors who are also developing related ID verification technologies, including Vancouver-based Trulioo, which raised $ 394 million in June, Seattle-based AuthenticID, which raised $ 100 million last month, and OCR Labs, which just raised $ 15 million. These companies are seeing increased demand amid the pandemic as companies move their processes online. Vouched differs in its patent-pending computer vision software, which examines various risk factors. “Vouched is a fully self-service and developer priority,” added CEO John Baird, a former executive director at Blue Nile and WE Communications. He co-founded the company with John Cao, who was chief technology officer but announced his resignation earlier this month. Other supporters include Bankers Healthcare Group, Professional Bank, Flying Fish Partners, Ascend.vc and angel investors such as Jove CEO Dave Atchison, Mike Potter, Callisto Media VP Brian Watkins, Revolve CFO Jesse Timmermans and Vijay Talwar, CEO of EMEA at Foot Locker . Total funding for the 20-person company is $ 12 million. “Darrell and Mark are legendary disruptors and builders in the industry,” Baird said in a press release. “Our strategic banking and legal partners will also be key partners in our effort to accelerate Vouched’s global identity platform: banking because it powers all business and relies on identity for every transaction, and legal because it is identity Are defined.” Vadon was previously the chairman of Zulily and online pet dealer Chewy. In 1999 he founded the online jewelry company Blue Nile; Cavens joined shortly after and was CTO. Cavens and Vadon both recently invested another Seattle startup, Rad Power Bikes, in March."
The Southwest’s looming water battle,33090,"By Drew Kann, Renée Rigdon and Daniel Wolfe, CNN
Published August 21, 2021 Maricopa, ArizonaFor farmers in the deserts of central Arizona, success and failure is defined by who has water and who does not. At the moment, Dan Thelander is still among the haves. Inside a municipal building in Pinal County, Thelander rolls a map out across the board room table. On the patchwork of brown desert and green farmland in front of us, Thelander points out the parcels of land where he and his brother, son and nephew grow cotton, alfalfa and several other crops. Second-generation farmer Dan Thelander stands by a new sprinkler system in one of his alfalfa fields in Maricopa, Arizona. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN About half the water he uses to irrigate his land is pumped out of ancient aquifers deep beneath the desert floor. The other half, however, originates hundreds of miles away at the headwaters of the Colorado River. Today, this river system supplies 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico, and irrigates more than 5 million acres of farmland on its way into Mexico and the Gulf of California. Las Vegas relies on the river for 90% of its water supply, Tucson for 82% and San Diego for around 66%. Large portions of the water used in Los Angeles, Phoenix and Denver also come from the river, and experts say these booming metropolises would not have been possible without its supply. But a crisis is unfolding, and farmers, scientists, water managers and policy makers across the Southwest are increasingly alarmed. Water managers have long recognized that the river is plagued by overuse. But over the last two decades, demand for the river’s water has often outstripped its supply. Since 2000, the river’s flows have shrunk by roughly 20% compared to the 20th century average, due in large part to the human-caused climate crisis. At the same time, its two main reservoirs — the savings account for the entire system in times of drought — have drained rapidly. Lake Mead — the largest manmade reservoir in the US, which is fed by the Colorado River — recently sunk to its lowest levels since the lake was filled in the 1930s. Its water levels have fallen more than 146 feet since their peak in January of 2000, and the lake is now just 35% full. Lake Powell, the river’s second largest reservoir, sits at 32% of its capacity. As water levels drop, billions of kilowatt hours of hydroelectricity that power homes from Nebraska to Arizona are also at risk. 2000 2021 Composite imagery from NASA/USGS “We’re in uncharted territory for this system,” says Jeff Lukas, an independent consultant and former research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he focused on water issues for 20 years. On Monday, the US Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever official shortage, which will trigger the largest mandatory water cuts to date in the Colorado River Basin. And after decades of receiving water from the Colorado River, the spigot could soon be turned off on many farms here, including Thelander’s. While the farmers knew this day would come, a harsh reality is setting in: To stay in business, they’ll need to pull more water from below ground. Back on the table, Thelander points to the diamonds and circles that dot the map. Those mark the locations of new groundwater wells that his irrigation district is considering — the first new ones they have drilled in decades, Thelander says. Thelander points to a map of canals and groundwater pumps in the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN For much of the last century, Colorado River management has focused on choosing who will be allowed to stick their straw into the river next and how much water they can take. At times, that process has sparked major disputes — with some leading all the way to the US Supreme Court. Now, many of the basin states are having a more painful discussion: deciding who will receive less water — and how much. Experts say the next phase in the river’s history could be even more contentious. The current Colorado River guidelines expire in 2026, and early negotiations are already getting underway for a new framework to determine how to divvy up its water. But by the time officials from the states, Mexico, Native American tribes and the federal government convene, it is likely that the river’s water supply will be even more tenuous than it is today. Thelander utilizes drip irrigation for his cotton fields in Maricopa, Arizona. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN Scientists and water policy experts say that the science is clear: The Colorado River’s supply will likely shrink further as the planet warms. Given what we know, many say we will have to use even less water in the future. But will the states be able to agree to new guidelines that reflect this reality? And with the Southwest’s growing urban centers and farms both reliant on the river’s supply, who will be willing to take less water? How elected officials and water managers answer those questions will decide the fate of the most important water resource in the American West — and the millions of people who rely on it. The roots of this current water crisis can be traced back nearly 100 years to the signing of the Colorado River Compact. In November of 1922, with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover overseeing the deliberations, delegates from all seven Colorado River Basin states convened in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to hammer out the guidelines. From the start, the compact negotiations were contentious. Squabbles erupted over details big and small, from how to measure the river’s flow to how to portion out its supply. Efforts to reach a deal began in January of 1922 and resumed in November, when delegates from the states gathered in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After two weeks of deliberations, they finally reached an agreement on November 24, 1922. Then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover presiding over the 1922 signing of the Colorado River Compact. US Bureau of Reclamation From the Southwest’s cities to its farms that feed the world, water managers say much of what we see today would not exist without the dams, canals and pipelines that the compact paved the way for. “[The Colorado River] is the lifeblood of the American Southwest,” says Jeff Kightlinger, who led Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District for 15 years before his recent retirement. “None of these cities would be possible but for the Colorado River and the development of it for all of these regions.” Over the course of the 20th century, new agreements and court decisions further divided up the river’s supply among the seven basin states, Mexico and the region’s Native American tribes. But there was a serious flaw in the original compact — one that, in part, explains why the river is facing its first-ever shortage today. When the delegates met, they agreed to give the Upper Basin (made up of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico) and the Lower Basin (California, Arizona, and Nevada) each 7.5 million acre-feet of water to use on an annual basis. Those portions were based on estimates that the river’s flow totaled roughly 16.4 million acre-feet each year. That was more than enough to meet the demands of the states. However, data shows those estimates exceed the amount of water the river actually provides in most years. Analysis of US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) data shows that between 1906 and 2019, annual flows on the river actually averaged just under 14.8 million acre-feet. Over the last two decades, flows have been even lower — just an estimated 12.3 million acre-feet on average each year. Up until the 1990s, the Lower Basin states were not using all the water they were entitled to on paper. This allowed officials to let the river’s water accounting problem persist for decades, experts say. “Through the 20th century, it was easy for political actors to ignore that reality …,” says John Fleck, a professor at the University of New Mexico who has written several books on the Colorado River and water issues in the West. “There was slack in the system because it took us a century to build all the dams and diversions that people dreamed about in the 1920s.” As water rights were granted and new canals were built, that slack has gradually disappeared. Data shows that the over-allocation problem became more apparent in the years after one of the last big straws was inserted into the river. The Central Arizona Project (CAP) — a massive, 336-mile canal and pipeline system that carries Colorado River water across the desert to Phoenix, Tucson and farms and towns in between — was authorized by Congress in 1968. Before the CAP was completed in the 1990s, heavy groundwater pumping in central Arizona was sucking aquifers dry at an alarming rate. The CAP promised a renewable, reliable source of water. With no infrastructure to deliver Colorado River water to cities in the middle of the state, Arizona was also only using about half of its Colorado River allocation before the CAP was completed, according to Ted Cooke, the general manager of the CAP. California had long opposed the project, so to gain support from the state’s congressional delegation, Arizona made a key concession: That in the event of a shortage, fulfilling California’s water deliveries would take priority over meeting the needs of CAP water users. Now, with water cuts looming next year, the CAP’s status in the Colorado River’s pecking order is proving significant. Arizona farmers like Dan Thelander have known for years that their supply of Colorado River water would eventually be phased out. They just didn’t expect it to happen so soon. A drought that began more than two decades ago, along with the effects of higher temperatures due to global warming, have rapidly sapped the river’s flow. And in the long-term, scientists and water policy experts say those problems pose a threat to users far beyond the farms of Pinal County. Rain evaporates near an irrigated cotton field in Casa Grande, Arizona. The area has been experiencing a “megadrought.” Caitlin O’Hara for CNN The Colorado River’s drainage basin spans some 246,000 square miles but most of its flow originates in a handful of snow-capped mountain ranges in southern Wyoming, western Colorado and northeastern Utah, according to Jeff Lukas, the research scientist and water consultant. The river flows through some of the country’s most arid land, so the snow that accumulates in those areas is critical. In most years, snowmelt is responsible for about 80% of the river’s water supply, Lukas says. Many scientific studies have examined why there is less water flowing into the river. Nearly all have found the fingerprints of human-caused climate change. The first, and perhaps most cited, explanation is the ongoing “megadrought,” which began in the year 2000. A study published in the journal Science in 2020 found that the period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest stretch the Southwest has experienced since the 1500s, and that nearly half of the drought’s severity could be attributed to global warming. “When you have more evaporation, you have less water left over to come down the river.” Chris Milly, US Geological Survey As dry as it has been, the study found that this may only be the beginning. Past megadroughts have lasted longer than the current one. But a lack of snow and rain doesn’t fully explain what is happening to the Colorado River. And droughts, after all, are temporary. Some scientists say the evidence shows the river’s shrinking supply is likely not so fleeting. Brad Udall, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, argues the river’s plight is best summed up by another term: aridification. Broadly speaking, aridification is a shift to a new climate state dominated by water scarcity and driven by the effects of hotter temperatures. Temperatures across the basin have risen by an average of 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over the last century. “[Warmer temperatures] are just this constant, year in and year out, force on the system,” Udall says. As temperatures warm, the amount of precipitation that falls as snow decreases, and the snow that does fall melts earlier, according to Chris Milly, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey who co-authored a study last year examining the river’s decline. Snowpack reflects much of the sun’s energy back into space. But as the snow melts earlier and leaves behind exposed soil, more heat from the sun is absorbed by the ground. This leads to more evaporation, which means less runoff ends up in the river, Milly said. “Evaporation is how the river basin cools itself,” Milly says. “When you have more evaporation, you have less water left over to come down the river.” Dry soils and thirsty plants also contribute to the problem. When soils are parched by high temperatures in the summer and fall months, it can lead to runoff reductions that persist even a year later, Udall says. Higher temperatures also mean that the atmosphere is “thirstier” and capable of holding more water. This increases evaporative losses from soils and water bodies. Over the last year, Udall says we’ve seen how some of these processes can lead to alarmingly low runoff and stream flows. All of this points to an unpleasant conclusion, Udall says: As long as humans fail to halt global warming, it’s likely that there will be even less water in the river in the future. A 2020 study in the journal Science co-authored by Milly tried to approximate how much less. The authors found that further decreases in the river’s flow are likely no matter what actions are taken. But without any significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the study found the river’s flows could shrink by as much as 31% by the middle of this century. “It’s possible you might have a wet year, but the long-term trend is in completely the wrong direction,” Udall says. “Every passing year that becomes clearer, and it’s getting harder for anyone who thinks otherwise to be taken seriously.” Beneath a drill rig towering high above the desert floor, two men in yellow hard hats pull levers to drive a massive metal pipe into the ground. Feet away, a deafening machine called a shaker vibrates violently, separating muddy drilling fluid from chunks of earth pulled loose by the drill bit as it punctures layers of clay, sand and gravel on its way down. It’s a scene you might expect to see in the vast oil fields of the Permian Basin. But here, surrounded by acres of alfalfa and dairy pens on the outskirts of Maricopa, Arizona, the men are looking for something more valuable to the local economy: water. To pump water up from the aquifer below, the men will have to drill down between 1,200 and 1,300 feet, according to Marty Weber, the CEO of Weber Water Resources, the company responsible for drilling this well. A new groundwater well is drilled on the outskirts of Maricopa, Arizona. Drew Kann/CNN This one is being paid for by the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District, with money given to the farmers by the state of Arizona and the CAP as part of their agreement under the state’s drought contingency plan. Drilling these wells is part of the farmers’ strategy to survive the cuts that are coming to their Colorado River water supply. Next year farmers in Thelander’s district will only get about 1/3 of the water supply they’ve received in past years. But in 2023, Pinal County’s farms will likely see their Colorado River supply dry up completely, according to the state’s drought plans. “… any way you cut it, our farm will be less profitable.” Dan Thelander, Tempe Farming Company Before the cuts take effect on January 1, 2022, Thelander hopes they will have nine to 10 new wells to make up some of the water they stand to lose. The new wells are just one sign of the changes coming soon to the county. Soon, there will be fallow fields, too. Right now, Thelander’s crops are doing well. But next year, he expects to leave 30% to 40% of his land unsown. “Like anybody in business, when you’re faced with adversity, you just knuckle down and do the best you can,” he says. “But any way you cut it, our farm will be less profitable.” While the desert heat is ideal for growing cotton, the county is also a dairy powerhouse. At one point, Pinal County ranked in the top 1% of all US counties for both cotton and milk sales, according to a 2018 study by economists at the University of Arizona. Many farms here, like Thelander’s, specialize in growing alfalfa, corn and other crops to feed the thousands of dairy cattle on local farms. Consumers in Phoenix likely won’t notice a difference when the water cuts kick in, says George Frisvold, a professor at the University of Arizona and a co-author of the 2018 study. But in the local farming economy, he expects there will be significant pain when the cutbacks take effect. “You’ll have these ripple effects through the economy, and jobs go away.” George Frisvold, University of Arizona The same 2018 University of Arizona study found that under a scenario where farms here lose all of the Colorado River water allocated to them, it could cost the county between $31.7 and $35 million and as many as 480 jobs. “You’ll have these ripple effects through the economy, and jobs go away,” Frisvold says. “In smaller, rural areas in Pinal County, it’s going to be more noticeable.” Jim Boyle, a dairy farmer who milks around 3,500 cows on his farm near Casa Grande, Arizona, says that he too will likely have to fallow some of the land where he grows feed for his cattle. And while he says he is fortunate to have deep, productive groundwater wells on his property, he is concerned about how others whose livelihoods are tied to farming will fare. Dairy cows are seen at fourth-generation farmer Jim Boyle’s farm. He plans to transition into having mostly Jersey cows because their smaller size means they do better in the Arizona heat and require less water and feed. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN “There are a lot of ag-related businesses in our county — the tractor sales guys, the machinery guys, the fertilizer and chemicals guys,” Boyle says. “It will have a roll-on effect throughout the county … and I think there’s some worry out there.” There is also concern from some in the state about the farmers’ return to heavy groundwater pumping. Before the CAP began delivering water to Pinal County’s farms in the late 1980s, farms here were totally reliant on groundwater to irrigate their crops. But pumping was depleting the aquifers faster than they could be replenished, causing huge fissures to form across the county as the ground sank. Boyle and his son James look over the Hohokam canal at the family’s dairy farm in Casa Grande, Arizona. The canal connects to the Central Arizona Project. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN Already, projections show there is not enough groundwater available to meet future demands in the Pinal County Active Management Area (AMA) — which includes much of Pinal County, as well as parts of Maricopa and Pima counties — according to an Arizona Department of Water Resources spokesperson. Last month, Tom Buschatzke, the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (AZDWR), told leaders in the AMA that “the days of utilizing native groundwater for development in Pinal are over, it’s done.” Still, with their Colorado River water on the verge of disappearing, farmers here are planning to pump even more groundwater to irrigate their fields. “I am concerned about Pinal turning to groundwater because that means there won’t be resources for future use,” says Sarah Porter, the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “It’s like spending your long-term savings — you want to do that very advisedly.” Whether the loss of Colorado River water will accelerate other trends in the county remains to be seen. Solar panels are seen across from Caywood Farms in Casa Grande. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN Nancy Caywood’s farm near Casa Grande used to get water from the San Carlos reservoir in Eastern Arizona, part of the Gila River system. The reservoir ran dry in April and she says her farm hasn’t received water since. To make ends meet, Caywood and her son, Travis Hartman, are growing corn on leased land that has access to Colorado River water. The money Hartman makes from that crop should help him keep the family farm, he says. But next year, farming there may no longer be an option, as cuts to Colorado River water hit the county. Already, Caywood’s 255-acre farm is flanked to the East by a large solar installation, and she says the farmland across the street could soon have panels installed. She says that they too have been approached before about leasing their land to solar developers, but ultimately decided against it. As the drought continues, she admits it is getting harder to tell them “no.” “We’ve just decided we’ll try to hang on and farm as long as we can,” she says. Nearly a century has passed since Herbert Hoover led the first attempt to divide up the Colorado River’s supply. But as the first mandatory water cuts loom, authorities in states across the basin say that they are preparing for a future with less water. For years, states like Arizona have been “banking” water from the Colorado River in aquifers. Las Vegas will phase out “nonfunctional grass” by 2027 in an effort to save precious water. And across the Southwest, cities are investing in wastewater treatment and reuse. All of this, they say, will allow their economies to thrive, even if the river’s supply shrinks. But what the next 100 years look like hinges on negotiations that are beginning to take shape now. Kightlinger, the recently retired general manager of California’s Metropolitan Water District and a veteran of past river negotiations, says he expects the 2026 process will be painful. “We had very intense, difficult negotiations in 2003 and 2007 and again in 2019. But this is going to be the hardest one yet.” An aerial view of the Red Rock Country Club in Las Vegas, where much of the grass turf, lakes and ponds have been been removed to save water and earn rebates from the Southern Nevada Water Authority. Roger Kisby/Redux A failure to reach an agreement could usher in an era of uncertainty for the basin’s 40 million water users and increase the likelihood of legal conflicts, says John Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, which provides water from the Colorado River to nearly 2.3 million people in Las Vegas and across the state. The drought contingency plans that were inked in 2019 between the federal government, the states, Native American tribes and other water users have, so far, staved off a worst-case scenario — like an emptied Lake Mead or Lake Powell. Entsminger and others pointed to those past negotiating successes and expressed confidence that they could reach a new deal. “The Colorado [River] has been described as the most litigated river in the world, and I think that’s true if you’re talking about the60s and 70s,” Entsminger says. “But since the mid-’90s, this has been the most successful river basin in the world in terms of seven states and the country next to it coming together and … figuring out how to make this river work for everyone.” One of the biggest challenges experts say negotiators must face is how to handle the large amount of water used by agriculture, which is responsible for around 70% of water use across the basin. Pinal County’s farmers are bearing the brunt of the first round of water cuts because of their low position in the state’s water priority system. But there are other farming centers, in Arizona and elsewhere, which possess some of the highest priority water rights in the entire basin. One of those places is Yuma, Arizona, the river’s last stop in the US before it flows into Mexico. Part of “America’s Salad Bowl,” around 90% of the leafy greens produced in the US in winter are grown on Yuma’s farms, according to the county’s chamber of commerce. Under current law, the entire Central Arizona Project could go dry before Yuma’s farms lose a drop of water, due to their high priority water rights, according to AZDWR director Tom Buschatzke. Buschatzke said that the US and the world need the healthy, high-value crops that they grow in Yuma, but acknowledged that the river’s shrinking supply may force difficult tradeoffs. “Certainly, the community of Yuma does not want to see any of the water that goes to those farms go to non-agricultural purposes, but that is something that is certainly on the radar screen,” Buschatzke says. Farm workers harvest and package cauliflower near Yuma, Arizona. Jon G. Fuller/VWPics/AP Tom Davis, the general manager of the Yuma County Water Users Association, says that with less water to go around, he expects there will be new pressure to shift agricultural water supplies to the Southwest’s growing cities. He says he and the farmers he represents will fight to “the bitter end” to protect their water rights, but recognizes that they are not untouchable. The water rights of many Native American tribes, whose ancestors have farmed across the region for thousands of years, are also among the highest priority in the entire basin. Today, 22 of the 30 federally recognized tribes in the region have rights to an estimated 22 to 26% of the river’s water supply, according to recent analysis from the Water and Tribes Initiative, an alliance dedicated to tribal water issues. But despite holding a sizeable portion of the pie, many tribes have been left out of these types of negotiations in the past. However, there are signs that this is changing in parts of the basin. Eugene Boonie, who is from Navajo Nation, fills up his water tank at the livestock water spigot in Gap, Arizona. Navajo land spans 27,000 square miles in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, and like many other Native American tribes in the Colorado River Basin, there are unresolved water rights claims on their land. Stephanie Keith/Reuters The Gila River Indian Community, located south of Phoenix in Maricopa and Pinal counties, now holds the single largest water allotment in the entire Central Arizona Project system, thanks to a 2004 settlement brokered with the federal government. The Gila River Indian Community’s governor, Stephen Roe Lewis, says he had to fight for a seat at the table in the negotiations over the 2019 drought contingency plan. But once there, he played a key role in helping push the deal across the finish line in Arizona. Now, as talks for the new 2026 guidelines begin, he says he plans to vigorously defend his community’s water. “If we’re treated as sovereign tribal entities and with respect towards our individual water histories, then I’m looking forward to being a part of the process.” As stakeholders prepare to protect their water supplies, plans to use even more river water are also forging ahead in some corners. “The Lake Powell pipeline is a symbol of our archaic, unsustainable water policy of the 20th century.” Zachary Frankel, Utah Rivers Council The most controversial new diversion is Utah’s proposed Lake Powell pipeline, which would pump Colorado River water from near Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona roughly 140 miles to the city of St. George, Utah, and surrounding towns. Critics say the project represents a denial of the realities of climate change that could imperil the water supplies of millions. “The Lake Powell pipeline is a symbol of our archaic, unsustainable water policy of the 20th century,” says Zachary Frankel, executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “… Utah is still in this fantasy pretending that climate change isn’t impacting our water supply, and it’s more than crazy — it’s irresponsible and reckless.” The bleached “bathtub rings” are visible on the rocky banks of Lake Powell at Reflection Canyon in Utah. They show where water levels used to be. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The project appeared to be on a fast track to approval under the Trump administration last year, but after the six other basin states sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt opposing the pipeline, Utah requested an extension to consider their views and other public comments. Despite their pushback, Utah’s new Colorado River commissioner Gene Shawcroft says he believes the project is important to the state’s growth and intends to push for its approval.

Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images Meanwhile, as water levels in Lake Mead plummet, states are exploring opportunities to develop new sources of water — in addition to what they receive from the Colorado River. Arizona is weighing the possibility of building desalination plants on the Sea of Cortez in Mexico to augment its water supplies. “… when the supply that we’re depending on is dwindling, what else are you going to do?” Ted Cooke, Central Arizona Project If built, the plants would use reverse osmosis or thermal distillation to transform salt water into fresh. That water could be used in Mexico and in exchange, Arizona would potentially receive a portion of Mexico’s Colorado River water supply, according to AZDWR director Tom Buschatzke. While legal and diplomatic hurdles remain, Buschatzke said the rapidly deteriorating situation on the river has added new urgency to the effort. Earlier this year, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and Governor Claudia Pavlovich of Mexico’s Sonora state signed an agreement to study potential desalination sites. Last year, a feasibility study found the plants could cost in excess of $3 billion to build and cost between $71 million and $119 million annually to operate, not to mention the huge amounts of energy required to pull salt from water. A harvested corn field in Casa Grande is no longer being irrigated. Caitlin O’Hara for CNN Still, with Arizona more vulnerable to water cuts than other states, Central Arizona Project General Manager Ted Cooke says everything must be on the table. “It’s expensive, but when the supply that we’re depending on is dwindling, what else are you going to do?,” he says. But new water sources are still years and billions of dollars away from becoming reality. As central Arizona prepares for painful water reductions and the possibility of deeper cuts in the next few years, the clock is ticking to conserve the supply millions rely on today. With each passing month, new projections offer a glimpse further into the river’s future. The picture they paint is not pretty. In June, new modeling showed there is a 17% chance that Lake Powell could sink so low by 2024 that hydroelectric generation at Glen Canyon Dam would become impossible. At full capacity, the dam can produce enough power for some 5.8 million homes. The loss of that electricity would add more stress to power sources in the West, which have shown vulnerability to blackouts in extreme heat amplified by global warming. Lake Powell’s plunging water level threatens Glen Canyon Dam’s capacity to produce hydropower. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images To keep the generators running, the Bureau of Reclamation recently announced that smaller reservoirs in the Upper basin would release water to help prop up Lake Powell. The influx they’ll provide will raise water levels by around 3 feet. But for a lake that now routinely drops 4 feet or more in a month, it may not buy much time. The future of Lake Mead also looks precarious. The same models show a 1-in-5 chance that the lake could fall to 1,000 feet above sea level by 2025. That’s only 50 feet above the bare minimum needed to allow Hoover Dam to generate electricity and just 105 feet above “dead pool.” At dead pool, what little water is left behind cannot flow through Hoover Dam. Instead, it would have to be pumped out. As water levels drop, new layers of the lake’s now-trademark “bathtub rings” are revealed. Today, the white mineral deposits left behind on the shoreline’s sandstone walls tower more than 140 feet above the boats below. They are a reminder of wetter times, ones that occurred not so long ago. They are also the most obvious sign of a river system, largely conceived in the 20th century, that is struggling to adapt to the harsh realities of climate change.

Suing your way to the stars – TechCrunch,8220,"Hello friends and welcome back to the week in retrospect! I’m back from a very fun and rehabilitative few weeks away from my phone, twitter account, and messaging cycle. Still, I really missed writing this newsletter and while Greg did a fantastic job in my absence, I won’t be releasing the reins anytime soon. A lot has happened this week and I was struggling to focus on a single topic, but I finally decided to focus on Bezos’ Blue Origin, which NASA was suing. If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get it in your inbox from the Newsletter page, and follow my tweets @lucasmtny. I wanted to write about OnlyFans for the newsletter this week and their rather shocking move of banning sexually explicit content from their website in order to stay friendly with the payment processors, but unfortunately I couldn’t help but write an article for ole TechCrunch dotcom instead. Here’s a link if you’re curious. Now, I should also add that while on vacation I missed all of the conversations about Apple’s incredibly controversial child sexual abuse detection software that seems to really compromise the perceived integrity of personal devices. I’m not the only one to find this a fairly worrying development, though Apple intends to fend off a worse alternative. Hopefully one of these weeks I’ll have time to speak to some folks in the decentralized computing space about how badly our monolithic dependence on a few tech companies that have very little consumer input is very bad. In the meantime, I am going to bring your attention to some reports from TechCrunch’s own Zack Whittaker on this subject that you should read as I am sure that this will be a subject that I will return to here in the future. Well then! On the current topic. Federal agencies generally don’t generate much admiration. While great things have been achieved at the behest of ample federal funding and the tireless work of civil servants, most agencies are treated as bureaucratic bloat and generally not viewed as something worth passionately defending. In the public and especially among technologists, NASA occupies a rather sacred space. The American space agency was generally a source of bipartisan enthusiasm, as was the goal of getting astronauts back to the lunar surface by 2024. Which brings us to some news this week. While so much digital ink was spilled, cowboy hat, champagne, and everything on Jeff Bezos’ little foray to the edge of space, there was less excitement over his space startup’s lawsuit against NASA, which we now know is the Lunar Lander will delay development of a new one by months, potentially calling into question NASA’s goal of getting astronauts back to the lunar surface on schedule. Bezos’ upstart Blue Origin is protesting the fact they haven’t won a government contract while Elon Musk’s SpaceX won a $ 2.89 billion contract to build a lunar lander. This contract wasn’t recently awarded either, SpaceX won it back in April and Blue Origin had already filed a complaint with the Government Accountability Office. It did so before Bezos wrote an open letter promising NASA a $ 2 billion discount. Neither of these maneuvers proved convincing enough for the folks at NASA and pushed Bezos’ space startup to sue the agency. That little feud has led long-minded Twitter users to dig up this little gem from a Bezos 2019 speech – as transcribed by Gizmodo – that highlights Bezos’ own dislike of how bureaucracy and greed highlight NASA’s ability to go for the stars grabbing, hindering: “To the extent that large NASA programs are seen as employment programs and need to be distributed to the right states, where the right senators live, and so on. That will change the goal. Your goal is not to get a man to the moon or a woman to the moon, but to get a woman to the moon while maintaining X jobs in my district. This is a complexing agent and not a healthy one …[…] Today, you know, there would be three protests and the losers would sue the federal government for not winning. It’s interesting, but what is slowing things down is procurement. It’s become the bigger bottleneck than technology, which I know for sure to all well-meaning folks at NASA is frustrating. A spokesman for Blue Origin called the lawsuit an “attempt to correct the shortcomings in the acquisition process for NASA’s Human Landing System.” But the lawsuit really seems to highlight just how bad this deal is for Blue Origin’s ability to lock down top talent. Whether the startup can handle the reputational risk of suing NASA and delaying America’s return to the moon seems like a question worth asking. Photo: ROBYN BECK / AFP via Getty Images Here are the TechCrunch news that caught my eye this week: OnlyFans prohibits “sexually explicit content”
Lots of people had pretty visceral reactions to OnlyFans killing a pretty large chunk of their business and banning “sexually explicit content” on the platform. It appears that the decision was made by leaning on the company by banking and payment partners. Musk “reveals” the “Tesla Bot”
It’s really hard for me to call this news at all, but I’d be remiss not to highlight how Elon Musk had a guy dress up in a spandex outfit and run around doing the robot and hundreds of messages about his new “Tesla” Bot “brought forth. While there could certainly be a product opportunity for Tesla here at some point, I’d bet all the Dogecoins in the world that its prototype, “coming next year,” either never arrives or falls hilariously below expectations. Facebook drops a VR meeting simulator
This week Facebook released one of its better virtual reality apps, a workspace app designed to help people host meetings in virtual reality. To be clear, no one really asked for it, but the company created a full PR press for the app that helps headset owners simulate the pristine experience of sitting in a conference room. Yeah, that looks stupid. But avatar-based work apps come for your zooms, and Facebook did a pretty compelling one here. https://t.co/aGvOW6zm8U – Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) August 19, 2021 Social platforms wrestle with Taliban presence on platforms
Following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, social media platforms are being pushed to clarify their policies on accounts operated by identified Taliban members. It put some of the platforms in a hairy position. Facebook publishes content transparency report
This week, Facebook released its first content transparency report, highlighting which data on the site had the greatest reach over a period of time, in this case three months. Compared to lists that highlight which posts are getting the most engagement on the platform, lists that are generally populated mostly by right-wing influencers and news sources, the list of posts with the greatest reach seems pretty harmless.

This Portland startup wants to build the ‘most inclusive and the most diverse’ kids media brand,9236,"Jelani Memory, Founder and CEO of A Kids Company About, with the book that started it all. (A child company via photo) There are the traditional ways to start, fund, and run a business and then there is the Jelani Memory approach. The CEO of A Kids Company About founded his Portland, Oregon-based company in 2019. The media company started with a book that Memory wrote for his children called “A Kids Book About Racism.” Memory, who is Black, is the father of a mixed family of four white and two brown children. Memory co-founded Circle Media, a successful technology company that provides parents with tools to regulate how their children use devices and apps. When people started requesting copies of his book for their own families, he decided to give it another shot. Two years later, what started out as a book publisher expanded to include podcast production. This month the company launched a series of online courses for middle and high school students. Topics such as divorce, fear, activism, cancer, career choice, authenticity, gender and other challenging topics are dealt with on the startup’s platforms. “We consider ourselves the most inclusive and diverse kids media brand of all time,” said Memory. In April, the startup completed a $ 7 million Series A Round led by Pendulum Holdings and funded almost entirely by black investors, including some who would normally have been excluded from VC opportunities. Pendulum was recently launched by Robbie Robinson, a financial advisor to former President Barack Obama, according to Recode. With the cash injection, A Kids Company About quadrupled its workforce to 25 employees last year. We recently caught up with Memory for a GeekWire interview to learn more about his nontraditional business strategies that support diversity, from product development to building a group of investors. Answers have been edited for clarity and length. A selection of the books, podcasts and online courses offered by A Kids Company About. (A child company via photo) GeekWire: You’ve taken an unusual approach to creating your content that makes it easier for new contributors to get into the media. How did this happen? Storage: I wrote my book and my kids got involved, and then other parents, teachers, adults, etc. So I thought, ‘How can I repeat what I’ve done?’ First I had to work with someone. And it can’t be sending her to a booth to be brilliant for six months. I have to work with them. Second, I’ll likely find someone who doesn’t write. You are probably not a writer, but you have something to say. So I’ll find these ‘voices of my own’ that can speak on these issues. When I have “writers” for each of them, people who are trained writers, it becomes much more difficult and less inclusive. The very first book we made after mine used this workshop model and it was really easy. It was, let’s work with this first person owned voice story. Let’s create a vulnerable context where we can all be open and honest and really share what we really want the kids to be heard and let’s create some honesty and urgency and write the book in the room together. GW: Can you describe the workshop model in more detail? Storage: For our books we write them in a single day. We’ll bring someone along for a five-hour workshop. We are doing this now with podcasts and classes. Of course, the whole thing isn’t being produced at that moment, but we’re all editing them for the core of the content. For the podcast, these are the name of the show, the imagination, the number of episodes, the topics, the ideas, and the tone and voice of the show. For the classes, we work on the whole curriculum within the class – the locations, the tone, the approach and we basically develop what I call a script. GW: You value honesty with children. Why is it important and how do you make it easier? Memory with another of his titles. (A child company via photo) Storage: We adults always feel the need to lie to children, as we do all the time. Spare them the pain, the hard feelings, the tears, the possible confusion. Maybe they don’t understand this word or I speak about it too soon. And so my job in the workshop really helped me [authors] write the book, but also urge them to ask, “What do you really wish someone told you when you were six?” Not, it’ll be fine, everything will be fine. You wish someone would tell you the truth, don’t you? And so we urge the storyteller to do it. [Workshopping] was an exam. We didn’t know if it would work. And we went through the first 12 books and it was like that, not only does it work, it is maybe the only way to tell those stories because it creates so much honesty and clarity. And then what’s cool from the author’s point of view, it’s a very low-level question, “Come on and write a book with us in one day.” As opposed to spending, which is often eight to twelve months. GW: Your round of funding was led by Pendulum Holdings, a start-up company. What can you tell us about it? Storage: In many ways, they are a traditional VC company. You use capital in a certain phase with a certain thesis for a return. This is normal and average and everyone in the VC world does it. What I love was different that they focused on black founders, they cut off checks that weren’t for small ones, what I call “peanuts checks”. They invested more than $ 5 million in capital in what is really Series A, Series B, and beyond. And they were a majority-owned black general partnership. GW: Why is it important to your mission to have a diverse company and investors? Storage: I am a second founder. The last company I started as a co-founder, chief product officer, raised $ 30 million. I was the only black or brown person among all investors, which was the worst-case scenario and a real shame and yet not uncommon. When I got the role of CEO and founder of this company, all I said was that it wasn’t going to be. Our team will be mixed. Our writers, staff, and teachers and hosts will be diverse. And our cap table will be diverse because we think it reflects and embodies the values ​​that we have as a company. GW: Black investors provided most of your funding. How did this happen? Storage: I had the chance to prove that there is another way. That it wasn’t the same VCs, the same angels, all investing in the same companies, all becoming billion dollar companies, making all the money, doing it all over again – there really was a new way to do it. This is really what I chose for both the seed round and Serie A. There are a lot of what I call “unconscious barriers” that keep people of skin color from investing in companies like mine. One of them is the accreditation rules for who is allowed to invest. Are you accredited or not? It turns out that you need to have a lot of money to get accredited. We hired non-accredited investors and that is a big no-go in the VC world. You won’t say that, but it’s a big no-go. They don’t call it a clean cap table. And they don’t like it when you take small checks, either. And I said, “Look, it’s my company, I can decide who the cap table is. If you don’t like it, I don’t want you on my cap table. “ There are a lot of what I call “unconscious barriers” that keep people of skin color from investing in companies like mine. With that, we have to go out and get people who give a check for $ 1,000, a check for $ 5,000. I can tell you we didn’t need those checks. I’ve had people waiting in line to write me checks for a million dollars. We could have replenished it with two investors if we wanted. But we chose to make room for people who are normally not included in the wealth creation process, not because they shouldn’t be, but because of the rules and regulations and access to those deals. All of these people bring diversity, they bring input, they bring credibility. They add so much to what we do. (Editor’s Note: U.S. Accredited Investors must have a net worth of at least $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence, or at least $ 200,000 per year for an individual or $ 300,000 for a couple over the past two years earn and expect to make the same amount this year.) GW: Do you see yourself as a role model for others as to how diversity can be meaningfully supported? Storage: Not only is it the puck in terms of the industry in general, both startups and VC investing, but my hope was to not only prove that it is possible, but that it can be normal that it cannot it has to be extraordinary that it can actually only be a completely normal course of business. And founders, it’s up to them to really choose who they want on their cap-table. For me, if you propose a partnership of VCs and go to their team page and all are white and male, you as a company simply have to ask yourself: “What are we interested in? What is important to us? “ I have to do my job; I have to build a healthy company and let it grow. And we have to have a meaningful liquidity event, that’s my job and I’m trying to do that. But who I bring for the trip is so important. This prosperity gap that exists for blacks and browns in this country doesn’t always have to exist, and I can’t just make it a problem for others. It’s okay for me as part of the mission of this company to make it my problem."
A Dollar Per Doughnut Per Day: One Man’s Vaccination Quest,2149,"“I don’t know if I changed anyone’s mind about the vaccine, but I know I certainly convinced people to go to Krispy Kreme,” he said. “To have a mission every day where I definitely have to get the donut – I mean, it’s silly, but I feel like I’m doing something positive in this world that could probably use a little positivity.” Updated Aug 21, 2021, 3:16 p.m. ET Mr. Caramagna, a bearded father of three with glasses and a self-deprecating sense of humor, originally wanted to reach 125 free donuts by December 31st. But with four months left in the calendar, he already has more than 90 and now he wants to see how many he can stow away. His Instagram page, on which fans of his Marvel and Disney comics often tag him, is a collage of crazy donut frills. There are the donut tree decorations, donut shirts, a donut cup, another donut cup and of course dozens of Krispy Kreme donuts. After seeing donut # 5 (or # 6) lying cold on the kitchen counter at home, his wife, Amy Caramagna, turned to him and said, “Oh, let’s do that now?” The workers at Krispy Kreme now recognize him he said, and he feels “like a VIP” when they hand him his donut in line with no questions asked. And his doctor recently told him he was in good health and gave him diet clearance in case the Krispy Kreme app notifies him that the donuts are “hot and fresh.” An original glazed donut at Krispy Kreme has 190 calories. According to Mr Caramagna’s Apple Watch, he burns 96 calories each way on his walk to get the donut. “So I actually have a deficit,” he said. “But I don’t encourage other people to do this.” Since March 22, Krispy Kreme has given away more than two million glazed donuts, said Casandra Williams, a company spokeswoman. Ms. Williams said that Krispy Kreme was “all about sharing the joy and we love it when our guests build on our efforts to give back in their own way.” Mindy Bloom, the chief development officer of the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Piedmont Triad, said in a statement that “like the Marvel superheroes he writes about,” Mr. Caramagna is a “hero, and we are loved by his creativity and.” Care inspires “. for our families. “"
California judge finds Prop 22 gig worker measure unconstitutional,2845,"A California judge ruled that Proposition 22, the measure that allows companies like Uber and Lyft to continue to classify app-based drivers as independent contractors in the state, is unenforceable and unconstitutional. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch found that Prop 22 “illegally restricts a future legislature’s power to define app-based drivers as employees subject to the Employee Compensation Act.” Proposal 22 was adopted by a wide margin in the state when most people voted for it in last November’s elections. Corporations were required by law to classify gig workers as full-time employees under Assembly Bill 5 A (AB5) passed in 2019, but some (like the ridesharing above) continued to treat them as contractors. Uber, Lyft, Instacart, and DoorDash poured over $ 220 million into the Prop 22 campaign to overthrow AB5, and the move clearly worked. The measure obliges gig companies to provide health care grants and a lower wage floor to their contractors, but it also exempts them from classifying their workers as workers with adequate benefits and protection. While proponents of the proposal argue that this would allow workers to retain their independence while enjoying benefits that they did not have before, not everyone is happy with the way things have developed. A group that includes the Service Employees International Union and the SEIU California State Council sued California earlier this year for overturning the proposal. Roesch explicitly highlighted Section 7451 of the measure in his ruling, which states that a future law on collective bargaining for app drivers must be in line with the rest of the proposal. “It only seems to protect the economic interest of network companies in a shared, non-unionized workforce, which is not a declared aim of the law,” he wrote in his decision. He also found it unconstitutional that any change to the measure would require seven eighths of an approval to be passed in the state legislature. If the verdict is in, gig companies like Uber and Lyft may have to spend hundreds of millions on healthcare and other additional benefits for their drivers. For now, however, Prop 22 is still in place and gig firms are already planning to appeal. An Uber spokesperson told The Chronicle: “This ruling ignores the will of the overwhelming majority of California voters and goes against both logic and the law. We will appeal and expect to win. Meanwhile, Prop. 22 remains in effect, including all of the safeguards and benefits it provides to independent workers “across the state.” All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team independently of our parent company.

"Facebook, Fearing Public Outcry, Shelved Earlier Report on Popular Posts",5822,"When Facebook released its first quarterly report this week of the most viewed posts in the United States, Guy Rosen, its vice president for integrity, said the social network had taken “a long journey” to be “by far the most transparent platform in the world” on the Internet “The list showed that the posts with the greatest reach were more innocuous, like recipes and cute animals. Facebook had a similar report for the first three months of the year, but executives never shared it with the public because they feared it would look bad for the company, according to internal emails sent by executives and the New York Times were notified. In that report, a copy of which was made available to the Times, the most viewed link was a news article with a headline suggesting that the coronavirus vaccine was responsible for the death of a Florida doctor. The report also revealed that a Facebook page of the Epoch Times, an anti-China newspaper spreading right-wing conspiracy theories, was the platform’s 19th most popular page in the first three months of 2021. The report was about to be released when some executives, including Alex Schultz, Facebook’s vice president of analytics and chief marketing officer, debated whether it would cause a public relations issue, according to internal emails. The company decided to postpone it. “We considered getting the report out sooner,” said Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, “but knowing that it was going to be the center of attention just like this week, there were fixes to the system we wanted to make . ” Mr Stone said Mr Schultz was in favor of publishing the original report but eventually agreed to the recommendation to hold back. Facebook hasn’t said why it decided to run a popularity report, but it is facing increasing scrutiny of the data it shares with the government and the public, particularly due to misinformation about the virus and vaccines. Criticism escalated as cases of the delta variant of the coronavirus increased. The White House has urged the company to share more information about inaccurate and misleading information on the website and better stop its spreading. Last month, President Biden accused the company of “killing people” by spreading false information, a statement that the White House later tempered. Other federal agencies have accused Facebook of withholding important data. Facebook has backed out and publicly accused the White House of scapegoating the company for failing to meet its vaccination goals. Facebook executives, including its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said the platform has been aggressively removing Covid-19 misinformation since the beginning of the pandemic. The company said it removed over 18 million pieces of misinformation during that period. But Brian Boland, a former vice president of product marketing for Facebook, said there are many reasons to be skeptical of data collected and published by a company that has a history of protecting its own interests. “You cannot trust a report that is curated by a company and is intended to combat press coverage rather than really useful transparency,” said Boland. “It’s up to regulators and government officials to give us that transparency.” In this week’s report, which covered public content viewed on the Facebook news feed from April 1 to June 30, popular links included local news, a cat GIF, and a Green Bay Packers alumni website. Popular posts, seen by tens of millions of accounts, contained viral question-and-answer prompts and memes. Most of the company’s draft reports, such as Facebook released on Wednesday, showed that the top 20 most-viewed links on Facebook in the United States led to non-political content such as recipe pages and stories about the United Nations Children’s Fund. The rejected report also contained the article about the doctor’s death in Florida. The headline of the article by The South Florida Sun Sentinel and republished by The Chicago Tribune: “A ‘healthy’ doctor died two weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why. “ This link has been viewed by nearly 54 million Facebook accounts in the US. Many commentators on the post asked questions about the safety of the vaccines. Six of the top 20 sharers came from public Facebook pages that regularly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics company owned by Facebook. Other top dividers in the story included Filipino Facebook pages that support President Rodrigo Duterte, a pro-Israel Facebook group, and a page called “Just the Facts,” which claims to be “posting the truth, even if the media.” don’t do it “. Months later, the coroner’s report said there wasn’t enough evidence to say whether the vaccine contributed to the doctor’s death. Far fewer people on Facebook saw this update. The 19th most popular site on the social network in the previous report was The Epoch Times’ Trending World, a publication that promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory and spread misleading claims of electoral fraud ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The Epoch Times is banned from advertising on Facebook for repeated violations of the platform’s political advertising guidelines. According to the report, Trending World was viewed by 81.4 million accounts, slightly less than the 18th most popular site, Fox News, which had 81.7 million viewers in the first three months of 2021. Facebook’s transparency report, released on Wednesday, also revealed that an Epoch Times subscription link was among the most viewed in the US. With around 44.2 million accounts seeing the link in April, May and June, it was about half as popular as Trending World in the postponed report. Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac contributed to the coverage. Jacob Silver and Ben Decker contributed to the research."
Indonesian D2C insurance marketplace Lifepal raises $9M Series A – TechCrunch,5660,"Choosing an insurance policy is one of the most complicated financial decisions a person can make. Jakarta-based Lifepal aims to simplify the process for Indonesians with a marketplace where users can compare policies from more than 50 vendors, get help from licensed agents, and make claims. The startup, which it claims to be the largest direct insurance market in the country, announced today that it has raised $ 9 million in a Series A. The round was led by ProBatus Capital, a Prudential Financial-backed venture capital firm involving Cathay Innovation and returning investors Insignia Venture Partners, ATM Capital and Hustle Fund. Lifepal was founded in 2019 by former Lazada executives Giacomo Ficari and Nicolo Robba as well as Benny Fajarai and Reza Muhammed. The new funding brings the total to $ 12 million. The marketplace partners currently offer around 300 policies for life, health, motor vehicle, property and travel insurance. Ficari, who also co-founded Neobank Aspire, told TechCrunch that Lifepal was created to make comparing, buying, and applying for insurance as easy as shopping online. “The same experience that a customer has today in a marketplace like Lazada – the convenience, all digital, fast delivery – that we saw was missing in the insurance company, which is still face-to-face with offline brokers like 20 to 30 Operated years ago, “he said. Indonesia’s insurance penetration rate is only around 3%, but the market is growing with the country’s gross domestic product thanks to a larger middle class. “We are really at a turning point in GDP per capita and a lot of insurance carriers are more focused on Indonesia,” said Ficari. Other venture capital backed insurtech startups that are capitalizing on this demand include Fuse, PasarPolis, and Qoala. Both Qoala and PasarPolis focus on “micro-guidelines” or inexpensive coverage for things like damaged equipment. PasarPolis is also working with Gojek to offer drivers health and accident insurance. Meanwhile, insurance specialists are amalgamating an online platform to conduct their business. Lifepal takes a different approach as it does not sell micro-policies and its marketplace allows customers to purchase directly from vendors rather than through agents.
According to Lifepal data, around 60% of health and life insurance customers are buying insurance for the first time. On the flip side, many auto insurance buyers already had policies but their coverage had expired and they decided to shop online instead of going to an agent for a new one. Ficari said Lifepal’s target customers overlap with the investment apps that are gaining traction in Indonesia’s growing middle class (like Ajaib, Pluang, and Pintu). Many of these apps have educational content as their customers are typically first-time investing millennials, and Lifepal is taking a similar approach. The content page called Lifepal Media focuses on articles for people dealing with insurance policies and related topics such as personal financial planning. The company says its website, including its blog, now has around 4 million monthly visitors, which forms a funnel for its marketplace. While one of the advantages of Lifepal is that people can compare policies on their own, many also rely on customer support, which is manned by licensed insurance agents. In fact, Ficari says around 90% of its customers use it. “We understand that insurance is complicated and expensive,” said Ficari. “People want to take their time to think and have a lot of questions, so we have good customer support in place.” He added that the combination of Lifepal, self-research and support, PolicyBazaar’s approach in India of the largest insurance aggregators in the country. To keep its business model scalable, Lifepal uses a recommendation engine that matches prospects with policies and customer service reps. It takes into account data points like budget (based on Lifepal’s research, its customers typically spend around 3% to 5% of their annual income on insurance), age, gender, family composition, and whether they have previously taken out insurance. Lifepal’s investment in ProBatus enables it to work with Assurance IQ, the insurance distribution automation platform acquired by Prudential Financial two years ago. In a statement, Ramneek Gupta, founder and managing partner of ProBatus Capital said that Lifepal’s “three-pronged approach” (the educational content, online marketplace and live agents for customer support) have the “potential to change the way How Indonesian Consumers Buy Insurance ”is changing. Some of Lifepal’s funding will be used to develop products that make applying for policies easier. Upcoming products include Insurance Wallet, which will include an application process with support in asserting a policy – for example, which auto repair shop or hospital a customer should go to – and an escalation if a claim is rejected. Another product called Easy Claim automates the complaint process. “The goal is to stay with the customer end-to-end, from reading content to comparing policies, purchasing, to renewing and using, so you can really see people stay around,” said Ficari. Lifepal is Cathay Innovation’s third Insurtech investment in the past 12 months. Investment Director Rajive Keshup told TechCrunch in an email that it supports Lifepal because “the company has grown phenomenally last year (12X) and is ready to surpass its aggressive 2021 plan despite the spread of the COVID Delta variant which underscores the fact that Lifepal is very strong “on track to replicate the success of similar global models such as Assurance IQ (US) and PolicyBazaar (India).”"
Covid Updates: Washington State Sets Highest Bar Yet for School Vaccine Mandates,35414,"Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington visiting a special education classroom at Phantom Lake Elementary School in Bellevue in March.Credit…Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times, via Associated Press All teachers and school personnel in Washington State — including coaches, bus drivers and volunteers — will need to be fully vaccinated as a condition of employment, under a new policy announced by Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday. The requirement applies to staff regardless of the type of school in which they work: public, charter or private. The policy is the strictest vaccine mandate imposed to date by any state for teachers and other staff members in schools, allowing for only a few exceptions. School staff must be vaccinated by Oct. 18 or face possible dismissal. “We are well past the point where testing is enough to keep people safe,” Mr. Inslee said at a news conference. “We’ve tried it. It has not been adequate for the task at hand.” He stressed that 95 percent of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in Washington were unvaccinated, and reminded the public that children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines. “When you decide to get a vaccine, you’re protecting a kid out there who can’t get it,” he said. Vaccine mandates have been hotly debated across the country, with a quarter of states, generally those led by Republicans, banning vaccine requirements for public employees like school staff, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education. But in recent days, some Democratic officials have moved to require the shots. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has offered teachers in public and private schools the option of either vaccination or regular virus testing. City school systems in Los Angeles and Chicago have gone further to require staff vaccination, though there is an exemption process for those with disabling medical conditions or sincerely held religious beliefs. Washington’s policy goes further than California’s. There is no option to choose regular testing instead of vaccination. There are limited exceptions, however, including for legitimate medical reasons and sincerely held religious beliefs. Individuals who refuse to get vaccinated will be subject to dismissal. The state had already announced a mask mandate inside schools. It is experiencing a Covid-19 case surge that is straining its health care system. Washington lagged behind most of the rest of the nation in reopening schools during the last academic year, as teachers’ unions across the state pushed for longer periods of remote learning, stricter virus safety measures in classrooms and access to vaccines for educators. All districts are planning to return to in-person learning five days a week this fall. Most districts reopen in early September. Vaccine and mask mandates will ensure that schools can remain open, said Chris Reykdal, the state superintendent of public instruction. Extended school closures have affected children’s learning — especially the least advantaged — and put strain on working mothers, he added. When school staff get vaccinated, “you are creating the buffer and protection for young people,” Mr. Reykdal said. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Washington Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, said she expected local chapters would be able to negotiate some details of the vaccine requirement. The union said in a statement that it “encourages everyone who can to get vaccinated immediately” and emphasized the continued importance of other safety measures in schools, such as masks, contact tracing, testing and social distancing. Jennifer Matter, president of the Seattle Education Association, which is the teachers’ union in the state’s largest school district, said the union and state “have a shared interest in creating a vaccine requirement to keep our community safe.” Ms. Matter said that her union planned to negotiate with the district on how the mandate will be implemented. The negotiations could include a process for requesting an exemption or provisions for time off to get a vaccine or recover from side effects, she said. Leaders of the two national teachers’ unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have said they support vaccine mandates for school staff. The governor also announced new mandates for workers in the state’s colleges and universities, as well as for many child care workers. And he announced that the state’s indoor mask mandate would be expanded to include vaccinated individuals. Antonia Aponte, 74, received the Moderna coronavirus vaccine at the Castle Hill Community Center in New York in February.Credit…James Estrin/The New York Times The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released three studies on Wednesday that federal officials said provided evidence that booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines would be needed in the coming months. But some experts said the new research did not back up the decision to recommend booster shots for all Americans. Taken together, the studies show that although the vaccines remain highly effective against hospitalizations and deaths, the bulwark they provide against infection with the virus has weakened in the past few months. The finding accords with early data from seven states, gathered this week by The New York Times, suggesting a rise in breakthrough infections and a smaller increase in hospitalizations among the vaccinated as the Delta variant spread in July. The decline in effectiveness against infection may result from waning vaccine immunity, a lapse in precautions like wearing masks or the rise of the highly contagious Delta variant, experts said — or a combination of all three. “We are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday. Citing the data, federal health officials outlined a plan for Americans who received the two vaccines to get booster shots eight months after receiving their second doses, starting Sept. 20. People who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may also require additional doses. But that vaccine was not rolled out until March 2021, and a plan to provide boosters will be made after reviewing new data expected over the next few weeks, officials said. Some scientists were skeptical of the administration’s new initiative. “These data support giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public,” said Dr. Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York and a former adviser on the pandemic to the administration. Boosters would only be warranted if the vaccines were failing to prevent hospitalizations with Covid-19, she said. “Feeling sick like a dog and laid up in bed, but not in the hospital with severe Covid, is not a good enough reason” for a campaign of booster shots, Dr. Gounder said. “We’ll be better protected by vaccinating the unvaccinated here and around the world.” It’s also unclear whether a third dose would help people who did not produce a robust immune response to the first two doses, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. And the recommendation for boosters may also end up undermining confidence in the vaccines, he warned: “A third shot will add to skepticism among people yet to receive one dose that the vaccines help them.” Together, the new studies indicate overall that vaccines have an effectiveness of roughly 55 percent against all infections, 80 percent against symptomatic infection, and 90 percent or higher against hospitalization, noted Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University. “Those numbers are actually very good,” Dr. Murray said. “The only group that these data would suggest boosters for, to me, is the immunocompromised.” Dr. Murray said a booster shot would undoubtedly boost immunity in an individual, but the added benefit may be minimal — and obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor dining and crowded bars. The administration’s emphasis on vaccines has undermined the importance of building other precautions into people’s lives in ways that are comfortable and sustainable, and bolstering capacity for testing, Dr. Murray and other experts said. Mauri Lynch received a coronavirus vaccine in Denver in February.Credit…Kevin Mohatt for The New York Times The Biden administration moved on several fronts Wednesday to fight back against the surging Delta variant of the coronavirus, strongly recommending booster shots for most vaccinated Americans and using federal leverage to force nursing homes to vaccinate their staffs. In remarks from the East Room of the White House, President Biden also directed his education secretary to “use all of his authority, and legal action if appropriate,” to deter states from banning universal masking in classrooms. That move will involve deploying the department’s civil rights division and is destined to escalate a fight between Mr. Biden and Republican governors who are blocking local school districts from requiring masks to protect against the virus. The dramatic shifts in strategy reflect the administration’s concerns that the Delta variant is erasing its hard-fought progress against the pandemic and thrusting the nation back to where it was early in the year. “The threat of the Delta virus remains real, but we are prepared, we have the tools, we can do this,” Mr. Biden said in the East Room, adding, “This is no time to let our guard down.” In the past, Mr. Biden has been reluctant to use the federal government’s power to withhold federal funding or intervene in school policies to order protective measures or force more vaccinations. But that changed on Wednesday, when he said his administration would make employee vaccination a condition for nursing homes to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. Officials said the decision would affect more than 15,000 nursing homes that employ 1.3 million workers. For many Americans, the booster strategy will affect them the most. The government plans to offer third shots to adults who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines eight months after they received their second dose, starting Sept. 20. About 150 million Americans have been fully immunized with one of those two vaccines. Officials stressed that the Food and Drug Administration still needs to make a final determination that third shots are safe and effective — a ruling expected in the coming weeks. On Wednesday afternoon, the president said his administration had been planning for the possibility of booster shots for months. The extra shots “will make you safer for longer,” he said. “The best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise is for every, every adult to get a booster shot,” he said, adding that everyone who is not vaccinated yet should go get their shots quickly. Senior federal officials said that the booster strategy stemmed from new data showing that vaccine efficacy against infection and mild disease wanes over time. They voiced concern that the vaccines’ protection against serious disease could also decrease in coming months. “Here’s what you need to know: If you are fully vaccinated, you still have a high degree of protection from the worst outcomes of Covid-19 — severe disease, hospitalization and death,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said. “We are not recommending that you go out and get a booster today.” Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting. The secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, speaks to Mia Arias, 10, during a visit to a Bronx elementary school on Tuesday.Credit…Brittainy Newman/Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Biden, escalating his fight with Republican governors who are blocking local school districts from requiring masks to protect against the coronavirus, said Wednesday that his Education Department to would use its broad powers — including taking possible legal action — to deter states from barring universal masking in classrooms. Mr. Biden said he directed Miguel Cardona, his education secretary, “to take additional steps to protect our children,” including against governors who he said are “setting a dangerous tone” in issuing executive orders banning masks mandates and have threatened to penalize school officials who defy them. “Unfortunately, as you’ve seen throughout this pandemic, some politicians are trying to turn public safety measures — that is, children wearing masks in school — into political disputes for their own political gain,” Mr. Biden said in remarks from the East Room of the White House, adding, “We are not going to sit by as governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children,” The federal intervention comes as school districts face a monumental task of trying to get students back to in-person learning and reverse the devastating setbacks experienced by a range of students. Mr. Biden’s move puts the federal government at the center of bitter local debates over how to mitigate against the virus in schools, just as the highly infectious Delta variant is fueling a spike in pediatric cases. In an interview Wednesday, Dr. Cardona said he, like the president, was, “appalled that there are adults who are blind to their blindness, that there are people who are putting policies in place that are putting students and staff at risk.” “At the end of the day,” he said, “we shouldn’t be having this conversation. What we’re dealing with now is negligence.” Dr. Cardona said he would deploy the Education Department’s civil rights enforcement arm to investigate states that block universal masking. The move marks a major turning point in the Biden administration’s effort to get as many students back to in-person schooling this fall, and the urgency felt nationwide about blunting the impact of a pandemic has wreaked havoc on students’ educational careers since March 2020. The nation’s most vulnerable students, namely students with disabilities, low-income students and students of color, have suffered the deepest setbacks when districts pivoted to remote learning, and their disproportionate disengagement has long drawn concern from education leaders and civil rights watchdogs. Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, students are entitled to a free, appropriate public education, known as FAPE, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin. The department could initiate its own investigations into districts, if state policies and actions rise to potential violations of students’ civil rights, and investigate complaints made by parents and advocates who argue that prohibiting masks mandates could deny a student their right to an education by putting them in harm’s way in school. A report released by the department’s civil rights office this summer provided a snapshot of the suffering experienced in the year since schools abruptly shut down in March 2020. The report noted that the pandemic challenges were particularly acute for students with disabilities whose educational success particularly relies on classroom time and hands-on services. “I’ve heard those parents, saying ‘Miguel, because of these policies, my child cannot access their school, I would be putting them in harm’s way,’” Dr. Cardona said. “And to me, that goes against a free appropriate public education. That goes against of the fundamental beliefs of educators across the country to protect their students and provide a well rounded education.” The administration will also send letters to six states — Arizona, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah — admonishing governors’ efforts to ban universal masking in schools. Last week, Dr. Cardona sent similar letters to the governors of Texas and Florida, reminding them that districts had both the funding and the discretion to implement safety measures that the C.D.C. recommended for schools. The secretary also made clear that he supported district leaders who defied the governors’ orders. He said he has communicated by phone with education leaders in Texas and Florida. In the conversations, he said, “we agree on vaccinations, we disagree on the use of mitigation strategies to keep students safe.” Teachers speak with anti-mask protesters about mask mandates outside of a Broward County School Board meeting, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., last week.Credit…Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun-Sentinel, via Associated Press Florida’s state board of education threatened this week to penalize local school board members and superintendents in Broward and Alachua Counties because they were requiring students to wear masks at school. But those threats did not stop Florida’s largest school district, Miami-Dade, as well as the school district in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, from approving similarly strict mask mandates on Wednesday, in further defiance of the state board. “Yesterday I spoke with a mother of a child who died,” Alberto Carvalho, the superintendent of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, told the state board of education on Wednesday. “Over the week, I’ve spoken with employees and their relatives, begging me to do the right thing.” He said he would “wear proudly as a badge of honor” any consequences that may come from his recommendation to require masks, which the school board adopted with a 7-1 vote later on Wednesday. Lubby Navarro, a board member, cast the lone dissenting vote. “I am not going to sit here and violate state law,” she said. Battles over school mask policies have engulfed Florida as hospitals have filled with Covid-19 patients, many of them young people. In Broward County, local officials warned this week that only five beds remained available in pediatric intensive care units there. Earlier this month, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ordered school districts to allow parents to opt out of mask requirements for their children. He also allowed parents whose children feel “bullied” by mask mandates to apply for a private-school voucher. The Hillsborough County Public Schools began its school year on Aug. 10 with parents allowed to opt out of its mask requirement. But the district quickly found so much virus in its schools that the board called a special meeting on Wednesday to consider stricter rules. They voted 5-2 to limit mask opt-outs to students with medical exemptions, in spite of a recommendation from Addison G. Davis, the superintendent, that the district keep its existing rules. “Right now, I think it’s really important to mask our children,” said Nadia T. Combs, one of the board members. She added that she’s “not here for the adults.” “I’m not here for politics,” she said. “I’m here to keep kids in school.” In the last week, the district has had to quarantine or isolate 10,384 out of its more than 214,000 students — nearly 5 percent — because of virus exposure. The emotional meeting in Tampa on Wednesday featured masked parents — some of them health care workers wearing scrubs — pleading for a stronger mandate, and unmasked parents — some of them wearing “Freedom Fighter” T-shirts — insisting on keeping the existing rules. “My children need to be unmasked,” said Kelly Boynton, one of the opponents. “It’s tyranny.” Before the meeting, Jennifer Buschner, who has two children in the district, said that her daughter, who is in second grade and has a rare genetic disorder, had hoped to return to the classroom, but the lack of a mask mandate made it too dangerous. “I was appalled,” Ms. Buschner said. “They took my daughter’s safety away from her, and made it so that she has to be home.” The county school boards in Alachua (based in Gainesville) and Broward (in Fort Lauderdale) each voted to require masks, with allowances for medical exemptions signed by a physician or other health care provider. The districts argued that such a mandate complied with both state health regulations and the governor’s order. But the state board of education disagreed. On Tuesday, the board directed the state commissioner of education to investigate and punish the two districts by withholding funds, suspending or removing school board members, or withholding their salaries. President Biden has condemned states who are blocking mask rules in local schools, saying they are putting politics above public health. His administration has offered to step in and help the districts financially or cover board members’ salaries if the state imposes those sanctions. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the administration would use the Department of Education’s civil rights enforcement authority to deter states from banning universal mask mandates in classrooms. Hours after the Florida state board of education threatened to penalize the two districts, the Alachua school board unanimously extended its mask mandate for eight more weeks. “That’s not defying me — that’s defying the state of Florida’s laws,” Mr. DeSantis told reporters in Broward on Wednesday. “That was the Legislature of Florida that said the parents are the ones that have ultimate responsibility for health, education and welfare.” Vickie Cartwright, the interim superintendent of the Broward County Public Schools, said district officials agreed with the governor’s view that children need to be in brick-and-mortar schools to do their best learning, and that was why the masks are necessary, amid so much virus spread. “We want our students back in person,” Dr. Cartwright said in an interview on Wednesday. “We want to keep them there.” An earthquake victim received treatment on Wednesday at the Ofatma Hospital in Les Cayes, Haiti. With disaster victims crowding the island’s hospitals, fewer resources are available for Covid-19 patients, W.H.O. officials warned. Credit…Reginald Louissaint Jr/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The recent deadly earthquake in southern Haiti and flash flooding from a tropical storm have set back efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic and administer vaccines in the country, World Health Organization officials said on Wednesday. “The earthquake aftermath combined with the Covid-19 pandemic presents a very challenging situation for the people of Haiti,” Dr. Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization, a part of the W.H.O., said at a news briefing. The disasters, she said, have added another major burden to an already strained health care system in an impoverished country that has been going through a political crisis since the assassination of its president last month. The powerful 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti’s southern peninsula over the weekend left at least 1,941 people dead and about 9,900 more injured. Heavy rains from Tropical Storm Grace then swept the country on Monday and Tuesday, touching off flash floods and landslides. According to W.H.O., four health facilities in the country were destroyed in the disasters, and 20 more were damaged. As overwhelmed hospitals turn their attention to disaster victims, fewer resources are available to treat Covid-19, Dr. Etienne said. It has also become more difficult to move medical supplies and personnel around the country. And it is difficult to keep the coronavirus from spreading readily in crowded emergency shelters. “With disruptive storms and hurricanes, the potential for an increase in cases is very high,” she added. Coronavirus vaccines were slow to trickle into Haiti even before the disasters. The 500,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine that reached Haiti last month through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative were the first significant supplies to reach the country. Only 21,000 people had received a dose by Tuesday, with health workers first in line, according to Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, the assistant director of P.A.H.O. “We are working with the Ministry of Health to expedite the process,” Dr. Barbosa said, adding that access to vaccination was especially important in the earthquake zone where people are living in makeshift shelter. Only about one in five people in Latin America is fully vaccinated so far, and vaccine supplies have been slow to arrive in many countries. In Caribbean and Central American nations, Dr. Barbosa said, vaccine hesitancy is emerging as a major new threat to immunization. At the same time, new case reports have been rising sharply, Dr. Etienne said, with spikes in Jamaica, Cuba, Costa Rica, Dominica and Belize. As hurricane season intensifies over the next few months, officials will remain “vigilant,” she said, about further strains on health care systems in vulnerable countries that could hamper efforts to reduce Covid-19 transmission. During the pandemic, Mark Wray was able to pivot from a job at a movie theater to a position working in tech support.Credit…Alycee Byrd for The New York Times Mark Wray was working at the concession stand of a movie theater when the pandemic lockdowns hit last year. The movie theater shut down, and he lost his job. But instead of looking for another low-wage job, Mr. Wray found a program teaching basic technology and business skills, completed it and landed a job at a fast-growing online mortgage lender. He started in March, working in customer service and tech support. He makes about $55,000 a year, compared with $17,000 at the movie theater. “The pandemic, weirdly, was an opportunity,” said Mr. Wray, 25, who is a high school graduate and lives in Charlotte, N.C. People returning to the work force after the pandemic are expecting more from their employers, pushing companies to raise pay, give bonuses and improve health care and tuition plans. Paychecks are getting bigger. Wages rose strongly in July, up 4 percent from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. Yet many workers are also seeking something else: a career path, not a dead-end job. For many, the issue is less about bargaining for more money in a tight labor market than about finding a job with a brighter future. “People in lower-wage work are saying, ‘I’m going to pivot to something better,’” said Stuart Andreason, director of the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Their demands are already reshaping corporate policies. Major employers of lower-wage hourly workers including Amazon, Chipotle and Walmart have announced improvements to their tuition and training programs. People who have worked in the field of work force development for decades say they see evidence of genuine change. In the past, for example, companies often blamed the education system for failing to produce enough qualified people of color to hire, said Elyse Rosenblum, founder and managing director of Grads of Life, which advises businesses on inclusive hiring practices. “But now, companies are increasingly looking internally and taking ownership of this challenge,” Ms. Rosenblum said. “That’s a completely different posture.” Inside a monitoring room observing Covid wards at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel, on Wednesday.Credit…Ammar Awad/Reuters Last spring, Israel’s remarkably swift vaccination campaign was seen as a global model. Coronavirus infections plummeted, an electronic pass allowed the vaccinated to attend indoor concerts and sporting events, and distancing rules and mask mandates were eventually scrapped. Israel offered the world a hopeful glimpse of the way out of the pandemic. No longer. A fourth wave of infections is rapidly approaching the levels of Israel’s worst days of the pandemic last winter. The daily rate of confirmed new virus cases has more than doubled in the last two weeks, making Israel a rising hot spot on the international charts. Restrictions on gatherings and commercial and entertainment venues were reinstated this week, and the government is considering a new lockdown. “I believe we are at war,” Israel’s coronavirus commissioner, Prof. Salman Zarka, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday. Scientists are still assessing how Israel’s pandemic response plunged from shining example to cautionary tale, and the stunning reversal has provided a crucial test for Israel’s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who staked a claim for leadership partly on the strength of his manifesto, “How to Beat a Pandemic.” But some experts fear that Israel’s high rate of infections among early vaccine recipients may indicate a waning of the vaccine’s protections over time, a finding that contributed to a U.S. decision Wednesday to begin offering booster shots to Americans widely starting next month.

Vaccinated people are far less likely to become severely ill or to die from Covid-19.Credit…Isadora Kosofsky for The New York Times Since Americans first began rolling up their sleeves for coronavirus vaccines, health officials have said that those who are immunized are very unlikely to become infected, or to suffer serious illness or death. But preliminary data from seven states hint that the arrival of the Delta variant in July may have altered the calculus. Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people accounted for at least one in five newly diagnosed cases in six of those states and higher percentages of total hospitalizations and deaths than had been previously observed in all of them, according to figures gathered by The New York Times. The absolute numbers remain very low, however, and there is little doubt that the vaccines remain powerfully protective. This continues to be “a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” as federal health officials have often said. Still, the trend marks a change in how vaccinated Americans might regard their risks. “Remember when the early vaccine studies came out, it was like nobody gets hospitalized, nobody dies,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “That clearly is not true.” The figures lend support to the view, widely held by officials in the Biden administration, that some Americans may benefit from booster shots in the coming months. Federal officials plan to authorize additional shots as early as mid-September, although it is not clear who will receive them. “If the chances of a breakthrough infection have gone up considerably, and I think the evidence is clear that they have, and the level of protection against severe illness is no longer as robust as it was, I think the case for boosters goes up pretty quickly,” Dr. Wachter said. The seven states — California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia — were examined because they are keeping the most detailed data. It is not certain that the trends in those states hold throughout the United States. In any event, scientists have always expected that as the population of vaccinated people grows, they will be represented more frequently in tallies of the severely ill and dead. “We don’t want to dilute the message that the vaccine is tremendously successful and protective, more so than we ever hoped initially,” said Dr. Scott Dryden-Peterson, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. “The fact that we’re seeing breakthrough cases and breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths doesn’t diminish that it still saves many people’s lives.” The C.D.C. declined to comment on the states’ numbers. The agency is expected to discuss breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and vaccine efficacy at a news briefing on Wednesday. Most analyses of breakthrough infections have included figures collected through the end of June. Based on the cumulative figures, the C.D.C. and public health experts had concluded that breakthrough infections were extremely rare, and that vaccinated people were highly unlikely to become severely ill. The states’ data do affirm that vaccinated people are far less likely to become severely ill or to die from Covid-19.

Gauging the spread of the coronavirus in Afghanistan has always been difficult because of a lack of testing. The average daily number of reported new cases peaked in late June at more than 2,000 and has since fallen sharply, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. But it is likely that the figures do not reflect the actual spread of the virus. Afghanistan’s vaccination efforts have struggled since they began in the spring, beset by corruption, limited public health resources and widespread public skepticism. According to Our World in Data, less than 2 percent of Afghanistan’s population has been vaccinated. “In the midst of a pandemic, we’re extremely concerned by the large displacement of people and increasing cases of diarrhea, malnutrition, high blood pressure, probable cases of Covid-19 and reproductive health complications,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O., said at a news conference. He said that W.H.O staff are still in Afghanistan and are “committed to delivering health services to the most vulnerable.” Many Afghans are vulnerable to diseases like polio, which has been eradicated in most of the world but is still endemic there. Fourteen million Afghans are suffering from hunger, United Nations officials said on Wednesday. Aid groups are struggling to provide humanitarian assistance inside Afghanistan, as well as to the tens of thousands of refugees a week who are fleeing to neighboring countries. “The utter desperation for a way out of Afghanistan speaks powerfully to the sense of fear and uncertainty among many Afghans,” said Caroline Van Buren, a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Refugee camps, with their crowded and often unsanitary conditions, can become incubators for the virus, though many camps have fared better than experts initially feared they would. U.N. officials said that their agencies in Afghanistan were in contact with the Taliban in an effort to coordinate aid and immunizations. Ms. Van Buren said the Taliban had so far provided protection for all of the refugee agency’s offices in the country. At the same time, though, the Taliban have resumed some of the practices common when they held power 20 years ago. Ms. Van Buren said officials had received reports of women being prohibited from going to work, and, in some areas, barred from leaving their homes without being accompanied by a close male relative. Some U.N. employees are pulling out. Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, said a group was leaving Kabul for Kazakhstan on Wednesday to set up a remote office there for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. Mr. Dujarric declined to specify exactly how many were leaving, though he said the office in Almaty was expected to employ up to 100 people."
Facebook cracks down on vaccine misinformation ‘superspreaders’,2614,"Back in March, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) released a report that linked more than two-thirds of online vaccine misinformation to 12 people. That statistic has since been cited widely, including by lawmakers and government officials, as evidence that Facebook has failed to control lies about COVID-19 vaccines. Now, five months later, Facebook says it has banned more than 36 accounts, groups and pages associated with these “super spreaders” of misinformation. The company says it took other measures to also make other content associated with these people less visible. “We also fined nearly two dozen additional pages, groups, or accounts associated with these 12 people, such as” We also fined some of their website domains so that all posts, including their website content, were in the In particular, some accounts associated with the group remain online, which Facebook says is due to either being “inactive”, not posting violating content, or sharing “a small amount” of such content. Facebook has questioned the CCDH report since it was first published, denying its methodology and conclusions. In its most recent statement, the social network said “there is no evidence” to support the report’s claim that 73 percent of the misinformation about vaccines is related to the group that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Joseph Mercola is related to , Del Bigtree and others are among prominent anti-vaccine activists. However, the report has given the company a headache as it was quoted by the US Surgeon General in a health advisory last month warning the public of vaccine misinformation on the Internet. In total, the company has removed around 3,000 groups, pages, and accounts for repeatedly breaking its rules on COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation during the pandemic, even though the company has still not released statistics on the number of times such misinformation is displayed become. In a statement, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed said Facebook “grossly misrepresented” the research. “Facebook grossly misrepresented the research by the CCDH and Anti-Vax Watch while it continues to hold back data showing how many of its users have been exposed to disinformation fueling vaccination hesitation. CCDH and Anti-Vax Watch remain completely transparent about their methodology, which relies on publicly available tools to track audience and content reach. “ All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team independently of our parent company.

"Booster shots for Pfizer, Moderna COVID vaccines planned for September",13120,"Alle Amerikaner, die die Pfizer- oder Moderna-Impfstoffe erhalten haben, benötigen unabhängig vom Alter acht Monate nach der zweiten Impfung COVID-19-Auffrischimpfung, teilte das US-Gesundheitsministerium am Mittwoch mit. Beamte sagen, dass sie bereit sind, bereits am 20. September Auffrischungsspritzen anzubieten, bis die FDA-Zulassung vorliegt. Laut einer HHS-Erklärung werden wahrscheinlich auch Booster für Menschen benötigt, die den Johnson & Johnson-Impfstoff erhalten haben. Die Anfangsdosen werden an diejenigen gehen, die am frühesten bei der Einführung des Impfstoffs vollständig geimpft wurden, darunter Gesundheitsdienstleister, Bewohner von Pflegeheimen und andere Senioren. Präsident Joe Biden sagte bei einem Briefing am Mittwoch, dass sich seine Regierung auf diesen Fall vorbereitet habe und über genügend Nachschub verfüge, und fügte hinzu, dass die kostenlosen Auffrischimpfungen an etwa 80.000 Impfstellen im ganzen Land erhältlich sein werden. “Es wird ganz einfach. Zeigen Sie einfach Ihren Impfausweis vor und Sie erhalten eine Auffrischungsimpfung”, sagte er. “Kein anderer Ausweis, keine Versicherung, keine staatliche Aufenthaltspflicht.” Andere Länder, darunter Israel, Frankreich und Deutschland, haben sich trotz des Widerstands der Weltgesundheitsorganisation, die sich für eine gerechtere Verteilung der Impfstoffe auf der ganzen Welt einsetzt, ebenfalls entschieden, Auffrischungsimpfung zu verabreichen. „Wir glauben eindeutig, dass die Daten nicht darauf hindeuten, dass Booster benötigt werden“, sagte Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, die leitende Wissenschaftlerin der WHO. Als Reaktion darauf wies Biden darauf hin, dass die USA mehr Impfstoffdosen gespendet haben als der Rest der Welt zusammen und sich verpflichtet haben, mehr als 600 Millionen Dosen zu verschenken. “Wir können uns um Amerika kümmern und gleichzeitig der Welt helfen”, sagte Biden. Die Nachricht, dass die USA eine Auffrischimpfung planen, kommt inmitten der Besorgnis über die nachlassende Immunität des Pfizer-Impfstoffs und die Zulassung von Auffrischimpfstoffen für immungeschwächte Menschen durch die Food and Drug Administration. Es kommt auch, da die Delta-Variante im ganzen Land wütet. Die Variante macht mehr als 98,8% der amerikanischen Fälle aus, berichteten die Zentren für die Kontrolle und Prävention von Krankheiten am Dienstag. Der Bericht, der Daten bis zum 14. August zusammenstellt, wurde veröffentlicht, als die USA nach Angaben der Johns Hopkins University seit Beginn der Pandemie 37 Millionen Fälle erreichten. Der August war nach Januar und Februar der drittschlechteste Monat für Coronavirus-Fälle im Jahr 2021. In der Zwischenzeit hat jeder Bundesstaat eine Teilimpfrate von mindestens 50 % bei den berechtigten Personen ab 12 Jahren erreicht, wobei einige Staaten 80 % überschreiten, sagte Cyrus Shahpar, COVID-19-Datendirektor des Weißen Hauses. Aber die USA brauchen “überall eine hohe Impfrate, um vollständig geschützt zu sein”, sagte er auf Twitter. Außerdem in den Nachrichten: ►Walt Disney World in Florida ermöglicht es den Besuchern zu wählen, ob sie Masken in Outdoor-Linien, Outdoor-Theatern und Outdoor-Attraktionen tragen möchten, nachdem sie zuvor beauftragt wurden. An allen Indoor-Standorten besteht weiterhin Maskenpflicht. ►Beamte auf Hawaiis Big Island erwägen, Strände zu schließen und die für den 9. Oktober geplante Ironman-Weltmeisterschaft abzusagen, als Reaktion auf eine Flut von Coronavirus-Fällen auf der Insel. ►Indigene Menschen waren laut CDC die wahrscheinlichste Gruppe, die ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert wurde und an dem Virus starb, und eine neue Studie zeigt, dass viele Staaten keine spezifischen Stammesdaten in Sterberegistern melden oder dies inkonsistent tun. ►In der jüngsten politischen Salve in Arizona über COVID-19-Maskenmandate erstellt Gouverneur Doug Ducey zwei Zuschussprogramme, die Familien und Schulbezirken, die Maskenmandate ablehnen, Mittel zur Verfügung stellen würden. ►Neuseelands erster Coronavirus-Ausbruch seit sechs Monaten ist auf sieben Personen angewachsen. Die Ankündigung am Mittwoch erfolgte einen Tag, nachdem Premierministerin Jacinda Ardern nach der Meldung des ersten Falls eine strenge Sperrung verhängt hatte. Die Sperrung dauert mindestens drei Tage für das Land und mindestens eine Woche für die Städte Auckland und Coromandel.  Die Zahlen von heute: In den USA gab es nach Angaben der Johns Hopkins University mehr als 37 Millionen bestätigte COVID-19-Fälle und 623.800 Todesfälle. Die weltweiten Gesamtzahlen: Mehr als 208,9 Millionen Fälle und 4,38 Millionen Todesfälle. Mehr als 168,8 Millionen Amerikaner – 50,9 % der Bevölkerung – wurden laut CDC vollständig geimpft.

Das Personal von Pflegeheimen muss gegen COVID-19 geimpft werden, damit die Einrichtungen Medicare- und Medicaid-Finanzierung erhalten, kündigte Präsident Joe Biden am Mittwoch an. Langzeitpflegeeinrichtungen gehörten zu Beginn der Coronavirus-Pandemie zu den am stärksten betroffenen Sektoren, und einige der Ausbrüche wurden auf Mitarbeiter zurückgeführt. Bundesdaten zeigen jedoch, dass 40% der Pflegeheimarbeiter im ganzen Land ungeimpft bleiben. Biden zitierte Studien, die zeigen, dass hohe Impfraten bei Pflegeheimpersonal mit einem Rückgang der Infektionen bei den Bewohnern um mindestens 30 % verbunden sind. „Wenn Sie nun ein Pflegeheim besuchen, leben oder in einem Pflegeheim arbeiten, sollten Sie kein hohes Risiko haben, sich durch ungeimpfte Mitarbeiter mit COVID zu infizieren“, sagte er. Die Regierung hat nach Möglichkeiten gesucht, Mandate zu nutzen, um Impfverweigerer zu ermutigen, Impfungen zu erhalten. Die neue Anforderung in Form einer Verordnung der Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services könnte bereits im nächsten Monat in Kraft treten. Der Schutz durch COVID-19-Impfstoffe nimmt im Laufe der Zeit ab, aber der Schutz vor den schwersten Auswirkungen der Krankheit, einschließlich Krankenhausaufenthalt und Tod, bleibt laut drei Studien, die am Mittwoch von der CDC veröffentlicht wurden, stark. Die Forschung, die als drei Artikel im Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report der Agentur veröffentlicht wurde, zeigt, dass die Wirksamkeit der Impfstoffe gegen die Delta-Variante ebenfalls “im Allgemeinen verringert” ist, sagte CDC-Direktorin Dr. Rochelle Walensky am Mittwoch. Die Abnahme der Wirksamkeit variiert je nach Kohorte, die Daten zeigen jedoch durchweg eine Abnahme. Eine Studie mit 10 Millionen New Yorkern ergab, dass die Wirksamkeit von 92 % im Mai auf etwa 80 % Ende Juli zurückgegangen ist, sagte Walensky. Daten aus den Einrichtungen des Mayo Clinic Health Systems zeigten, dass die Wirksamkeit des Pfizer-BioNTech-Impfstoffs von 76 % auf 42 % und die von Moderna von 86 % auf 76 % zurückging, fügte sie hinzu. Außerdem zeigten Berichte aus Tausenden von Pflegeheimen, dass die Wirksamkeit bei den am stärksten gefährdeten Bevölkerungsgruppen in den Monaten, in denen Delta die dominierende Belastung war, von 75 % im März auf 53 % am 1. August gesunken ist, sagte sie. Eine Analyse von Patienten in 21 Krankenhäusern in 18 Bundesstaaten ergab jedoch bis Juli „anhaltend hohen Schutz vor schwerem COVID-19, das einen Krankenhausaufenthalt erfordert“. Der führende US-Experte für Infektionskrankheiten, Dr. Anthony Fauci, sagte am Mittwoch, die Daten deuten darauf hin, dass die Antikörperspiegel unabhängig von der Variante im Laufe der Zeit sinken, aber eine Auffrischungsdosis erhöht die Antikörperspiegel um das Zehnfache. Höhere Antikörperspiegel entsprechen einer höheren Impfstoffwirksamkeit und können zum Schutz gegen die Delta-Variante erforderlich sein. “All dies unterstützt die Verwendung einer dritten Booster-mRNA-Immunisierung”, sagte Fauci. Mississippi, dessen Impfrate mit 36% zu den niedrigsten des Landes gehört, hat die zweifelhafte Auszeichnung, die höchste Anzahl von Coronavirus-Infektionen pro Kopf zu melden. Der Bundesstaat hat kürzlich sein zweites Feldkrankenhaus zur Behandlung eines Anstiegs von Coronavirus-Patienten mit 32 Betten unter Zelten in einer Garage des University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson eröffnet. Mississippi verdrängte das benachbarte Louisiana mit etwa 798 Fällen pro 100.000 in der Woche bis Dienstag. Louisianas Infektionsrate sank etwas auf 759 pro 100.000 pro Woche, während Florida mit 706 die drittschlechteste war. Die Übertragung durch die Gemeinschaft in den USA wird mit 100 Fällen pro Woche als “hoch” angesehen. Maine ist der einzige Staat unterhalb dieser Marke. – Mike Stucka Mitglieder des Florida Board of Education stellten fest, dass zwei Schulbezirke gegen staatliche Gesetze verstoßen haben und für das Ignorieren von Verboten von Maskenpflichten bestraft werden könnten. Die Mitglieder stimmten am Dienstag einstimmig für den Bildungskommissar Richard Corcoran, um eine Durchführungsverordnung von Gouverneur Ron DeSantis und eine staatliche Regelung des Gesundheitsministeriums von Florida durchzusetzen, die den Schulbezirken vorschreibt, Eltern zu erlauben, sich von Maskenpflichten abzumelden. Schulbezirke in den Landkreisen Alachua und Broward könnten mit einem möglichen Verlust von Finanzmitteln, der Entfernung lokaler Beamter und weiteren Maßnahmen der staatlichen Gesetzgebung konfrontiert werden. Superintendenten beider Bezirke sagten während der Telefonkonferenz, dass ihre Bezirke die Gesetze des Bundesstaates einhalten und versuchen, den Schülern eine sichere Lernumgebung zu bieten. In beiden Bezirken können Studierende mit schriftlicher Empfehlung eines Arztes vom Tragen einer Maske befreit werden. Die staatlichen Regeln besagen, dass Schüler mit Erlaubnis eines Elternteils oder Erziehungsberechtigten maskenlos gehen können. Trotz der Drohungen hat die Schulbehörde in Alachua am Dienstagabend dafür gestimmt, ihr Maskenmandat für Schüler um weitere acht Wochen zu verlängern. Ein kleiner Schulbezirk in Texas fügte seiner Kleiderordnung für Schüler und Mitarbeiter Masken hinzu, um die Anordnung des Gouverneurs zum Verbot von Maskenpflichten in öffentlichen Schulen zu umgehen. Der Vorstand des Pariser Unabhängigen Schulbezirks stimmte während einer Dringlichkeitssitzung am Dienstag dafür, die Kleiderordnung zu ändern, bevor seine fast 4.000 Schüler diese Woche in den Unterricht zurückkehren. Die Kleiderordnung wird bei jeder monatlichen Vorstandssitzung überdacht, berichteten die Paris News. „Der Vorstand ist der Ansicht, dass die Kleiderordnung verwendet werden kann, um übertragbare Gesundheitsprobleme zu mildern, und hat daher die PISD-Kleiderordnung geändert, um unsere Studenten und Mitarbeiter zu schützen“, sagten die Vorstandsmitglieder in einer Erklärung. Während der Rechtsstreit um Masken in Schulen im Bundesstaat weitergeht, haben mindestens vier Schulbezirke aufgrund von COVID-19-Ausbrüchen den Campus geschlossen. Papst Franziskus und sechs katholische Kardinäle und Erzbischöfe veröffentlichten am Mittwoch eine öffentliche Bekanntmachung, in der sie die Menschen aufforderten, sich einen COVID-19-Impfstoff zu besorgen. „Dank Gottes Gnade und der Arbeit vieler haben wir jetzt Impfstoffe, die uns vor COVID-19 schützen“, sagte der Papst in dem Video, der an einem Schreibtisch im Vatikan sitzt und eine weiße Soutane und eine Mütze trägt. “Impfen zu lassen ist eine einfache, aber tiefgreifende Art, sich umeinander zu kümmern, insbesondere für die Schwächsten”, sagte er. “Ich bete zu Gott, dass jeder von uns seine eigene kleine Geste der Liebe machen kann.” Lesen Sie die ganze Geschichte. – Elizabeth Weise Ein hochrangiger Gesundheitsbeamter von Mississippi sagte, dass derzeit etwa 20.000 Schüler im Bundesstaat wegen COVID-19-Exposition unter Quarantäne gestellt werden – 4,5 % der öffentlichen Schulbevölkerung, so die neuesten Einschulungszahlen des Bundesstaates. “Diese Störungen … werden noch eine Weile andauern”, sagte Dr. Paul Byers, Epidemiologe des Staates Mississippi, den Mitgliedern des Mississippi Chapters der American Academy of Pediatrics. Die Schulausbrüche haben dazu geführt, dass viele Schulbeamte ihre Richtlinien nach Beginn des Schuljahres ohne Einschränkungen wie Maskenpflichten überdenken. Rund 600 Schulen haben inzwischen eine universelle Maskierung für Innenräume implementiert, sagte Byers. Die Fälle und Krankenhauseinweisungen bei Kindern nehmen zu, wobei die hoch ansteckende Delta-Variante des Coronavirus Experten zufolge etwa 90% der Neuinfektionen bei Kindern ausmacht. Kinder unter 12 Jahren sind derzeit nicht für den COVID-19-Impfstoff geeignet, was Schulen zu einer potenziell gefährlichen Umgebung macht. Lesen Sie hier mehr. Beitrag: The Associated Press"
"Texas Gov. Abbott, other mask mandate critics test positive for COVID",10042,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who banned masking requirements in schools despite opposition from several school districts, has contracted the coronavirus. Abbott’s office said the Republican governor, who is fully vaccinated and tested daily, got a positive result Tuesday. “Governor Abbott is in constant communication with his staff, officers and government officials to ensure that the state government continues to operate smoothly and efficiently,” said communications director Mark Miner in a statement. “The governor will isolate himself in the governor’s mansion and continue testing daily. Governor Abbott will receive monoclonal antibody treatment from Regeneron. ” This is the same treatment that helped President Donald Trump overcome his fight against COVID-19 last October. Abbott belongs to a group of Republican politicians who recently caught the virus and who speak out against vaccination and mask mandates. Abbott’s stance on measures to contain the virus has drawn the ire of parent and activist groups, and one of the latter, Marked by COVID, released a statement Tuesday that said: “Our governor worked harder to keep masks out of schools than he worked to keep guns out of schools. In his relentless and cruel pursuit of control mandates in the name of physical autonomy, he has contracted COVID himself and uses every available HIM resource, but refuses to allow local governments to use their own resources to save lives. ” At least four school districts in Texas have closed campuses due to coronavirus outbreaks at the start of the new academic year. Abbott spoke at an event in Collin County on Monday, and photos on social media show him mingling with the mostly unmasked crowd to shake hands and pose for pictures. Miner said Abbott, 63, was “in good health and currently has no symptoms”. In July Abbott signed an executive order banning government agencies from requiring “vaccine passports” and then went further by extending the ban to the private sector. Also on the news: ► In preparation for further dire developments, Texas has requested five hearses from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Texas only follows Florida among the states with the highest number of COVID deaths per day, both averaging over 160. No other state is above 50. ►If the Dodgers host playoff games in October, their fans will likely have to cover their faces. Starting Friday, Los Angeles County will require those attending outdoor events with more than 10,000 people, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a mask. ►Chicago has reintroduced a mask requirement for everyone in public indoor spaces, regardless of their vaccination status. ► Moderna’s COVID vaccine was the second coronavirus vaccine approved in the UK for use in children aged 12-17, after Pfizer’s. ►Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak said large indoor venues in cities like Las Vegas and Reno are allowed to opt out of state masking requirements when verifying their guests are vaccinated.  Today’s numbers: In the United States, there have been more than 37 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 623,200 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The global totals: More than 208.4 million cases and 4.38 million deaths. More than 168.6 million Americans – 50.8% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.

Two Republican lawmakers who spoke out against mask and vaccine mandates were treated in hospital after contracting the coronavirus. De Pere’s Wisconsin Senator Andre Jacque said Monday that he and some family members tested positive late last week and that he was in a hospital with pneumonia. He did not say whether he was accepted. Jacque, who testified at the Wisconsin State Capitol on Wednesday without wearing a mask in at least one hearing, has spoken out in contempt for vaccine mandates and voted against the governor’s mask requirement. In North Carolina, Craven County’s house member Keith Kidwell, who has called vaccine campaigns “manipulation”, was hospitalized with his wife last week after he was diagnosed with COVID-19. In a message his colleague Larry Pittman read on the House floor the Thursday before hospitalization, Kidwell said, “Going to the bathroom alone is exhausting.” – Molly Beck, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and Todd Wetherington, New Bern Sun Journal Air, rail and bus travelers must mask the rest of the year and through mid-January. According to several reports, the Biden government is expected to extend this requirement again until January 18, 2022. The federal requirement, which began February 1, was originally due to expire on May 11, but was extended to September 13 in April. The airlines had been pushing for the unpopular mandate to expire with some passengers, but that was before the delta variant of the coronavirus caused infections of over 100,000 a day in the US. – Morgan Hines and Bailey Schulz Forty-four states are reporting rising coronavirus numbers, the lowest total in more than a month, but 38 states reported rising deaths again, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada and Vermont reported fewer new COVID-19 cases in the week ended Monday compared to the previous week. Nonetheless, Hawaii, Mississippi and Oregon again set new records for the number of cases on Monday amid the surge fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant. With so much data suggesting the pandemic is far from over, the Biden Administration health officials are expected to inform all Americans who have received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines eight months after their second COVID vaccination. 19 booster vaccinations, regardless of age, recommend a source familiar with the plans confirmed to the US TODAY. The booster will begin as early as mid to late September once the FDA officially approves the vaccines. Florida’s largest school district in Miami-Dade County is likely to require students to wear face masks when classrooms open next week after a task force of medical experts was recommended and governed by Governor Ron DeSantis’ ban on mandatory masking rules. The Miami-Dade County School Board is expected to approve the measure on Wednesday. “My determination is on the way forward,” said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho. Students in neighboring Broward County will be wearing masks on their return for the fall semester Wednesday. And in the Tampa area, the Hillsborough County School Board, which did not require masks, has scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday to discuss additional measures against COVID-19. Biden’s government will continue to fully reimburse states for some COVID-19 emergency response costs through the end of the year, USA TODAY has learned. According to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity, administration officials will announce the extension during their weekly phone call with governors. The services covered include emergency medical care, vaccinations and housing for high-risk groups such as the homeless. “We will continue to … make decisions like this based on your needs,” said Charlie Anderson, the director of economic and fiscal policy for the government’s COVID-19 response team. “There are many people on the front lines doing all they can, including state governments … And it is critical to continue to be a strong partner in that effort, given what they are up against.” – Maureen Bullhead Thousands of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of deaths in California, Oregon and Washington state from March to December 2020 could be linked to forest fire smoke, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances. Researchers at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health used a statistical model to measure the relationship between high levels of particulate matter from forest fires and the number of infections and deaths in 92 counties. In the three states studied, researchers found nearly 19,700 cases and 750 deaths were attributable to the fires. “This tiny particle is small enough to bury itself in the lungs, making it suitable for any respiratory disease,” said Dr. Len Horovitz, lung specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. – Adrianna Rodriguez The 5 million people in New Zealand launched a strict lockdown Tuesday that will last at least three days after a case of coronavirus is found. Auckland, where the infected man lives, and Coromandel, where he was visiting, face a seven-day lockdown. Schools and almost all workplaces closed. When people leave their homes, they are encouraged to wear a mask pending a possible mandate that could come as early as Wednesday. New Zealand has reported only 26 virus deaths since the pandemic began. “We know this strategy is working, we know that we are a strong team of 5 million and we know that life will be easier, we just have to move on,” said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. New York, the first major city in the country to require at least partial vaccination for indoor activities such as eating and using the gym, has been requiring proof since Tuesday. Mayor Bill de Blasio added the demand on Monday to the list of public venues: “If we stop the Delta variant, now is the time,” he said. New Orleans’ vaccination mandate for all indoor venues and outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people went into effect Monday. San Francisco’s full vaccination requirement for indoor activities begins Friday. New York State and DC are both the newest areas to mandate vaccinations for medical personnel, with both announcing mandates on Monday. Similar moves were previously announced in California and Washington state.

Twitter asks users to flag COVID-19 and election misinformation – TechCrunch,3560,"Twitter introduced a new testing feature on Tuesday that allows users to report any misinformation they encounter on the platform and report it to the company as “misleading”. The test will roll out to most users in the United States, Australia, and South Korea starting today. In the new test, Twitter users can expand the context menu with the three dots in the upper right corner of a tweet to select “Report tweet”, where they will encounter the new option to report a misleading tweet. The next menu allows users to indicate that a tweet is misleading about “Politics,” “Health,” or “something else”. If they choose politics, they can indicate whether the misleading political tweet is related to elections, and if they choose health, they can flag a misleading tweet specifically about COVID-19. Twitter previously added a way for users to report election-related misinformation, although those options were previously temporary features related to global elections. Back in 2019, the platform introduced the option to report misleading tweets about voting to protect elections in Europe and India. The intent is to give users an opportunity to uncover Tweets that violate Twitter’s existing policies on misinformation related to elections and pandemics, two issues that policy and enforcement efforts are focused on. The user reporting system will work with Twitter’s proactive systems to identify potentially dangerous misinformation based on a combination of human and automated moderation. For now, users will not receive updates from the company about what happens to misleading tweets they report, although these updates may be added in the future. While the new reporting feature will be widely available, the company describes the test as an “experiment” rather than a finished feature. Twitter will watch as people on the platform use the new misinformation reporting tool to see if user reporting can be an effective tool in identifying potentially harmful misleading tweets, even though the company does not have a set schedule for full implementation or removal of the test. represent. At the moment, Twitter doesn’t seem very concerned about users abusing the feature as the new user reporting option is built right into its established moderation system. Still, the idea of ​​users alerting the company to “misleading” tweets is sure to spark new cries of censorship from corners of the platform that are already prone to spreading misinformation. While the option to mark tweets as misleading is new, the feature will feed reported tweets into the existing enforcement flow of Twitter, where the established rules on health and political misinformation are implemented through a mix of human and algorithmic moderation. This process also sorts reported tweets by priority for review. Tweets from users with large followers, or tweets that generate unusually high levels of engagement, top the ranking, as do tweets related to elections and COVID-19, Twitter’s two focus areas when it comes to surveillance of misinformation. The new test is Twitter’s latest attempt to rely more on its own community to identify misinformation. Twitter’s most ambitious experiment in this direction is Birdwatch, a crowdsourced method for users to attach contextual notes and fact checks to tweets that can be rated positively or negatively, Reddit-style. Right now, Birdwatch is just a pilot program, but it’s clear the company is interested in decentralizing moderation – an experiment that is far more thorny than just adding a new way to report tweets."
US expected to recommend vaccine boosters for all Americans,8981,"U.S. experts are expected to recommend COVID-19 vaccine boosters to all Americans regardless of age eight months after receiving the second dose of vaccine to ensure permanent protection from the coronavirus as the Delta variant spreads across the country . So say two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. An announcement was expected earlier this week, with doses starting to be given in large quantities once the Food and Drug Administration officially approves the vaccines. This action is expected for the Pfizer shot in the coming weeks. US health officials last week recommended boosters for some with compromised immune systems. Also on the news: ►New York, the first major city in the country to require at least partial vaccination for indoor activities such as eating and using the gym, will require proof from Tuesday. Mayor Bill de Blasio added the default to the list of public venues on Monday. ►The first four days of school in Nashville, Tennessee, revealed more than 250 cases of COVID-19 – 207 of them among high school students – and quarantined more than 1,000 students and staff. Metro Nashville Public Schools, with more than 80,000 students, began teaching Tuesday. ►CVS and Walgreens pharmacies started giving the newly approved third coronavirus vaccine to people with immunodeficiency conditions. Individuals who completed their first two doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine at least 28 days ago and have a qualifying medical condition may schedule their booster vaccination. ►The US administered 665,000 doses of vaccine on Sunday, including 404,000 newly vaccinated, said Cyrus Shahpar, COVID-19 data director for the White House. Among the eligible people – 12 years and older – almost 70% received at least one dose, including 72% of adults.  Today’s numbers: There have been more than 36.8 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 622,000 deaths in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. The global totals: More than 207.7 million cases and 4.37 million deaths. More than 168.6 million Americans – 50.8% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.

Sign up for USA TODAY’s Coronavirus Watch newsletter to receive updates straight to your inbox and join our Facebook group. Public health, politics and education made an uncomfortable mix in many parts of the country on Monday as hundreds of thousands of K-12 students returned to school amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Confusion erupted in several Texas school districts after the state Supreme Court suspended mask requirements in two of the largest counties prior to the first day of school in Dallas. An Arizona judge at least temporarily upheld a mask mandate in a Phoenix district, despite a new state law prohibiting such requirements. A county in Colorado sent the sheriff’s deputies to schools on the first day of class as a precautionary measure after parents protested at the last minute against a mask mandate. After the coronavirus pandemic forced widespread school closings and distance learning for several months, the new school year is facing various interruptions, partly caused by the virus. Some early-start districts have already closed schools due to outbreaks while others are trying to survive them. In South Carolina, pressure is on the governor and general assembly to lift a ban on school mask mandates as infections escalate. Nowhere was the fighting bigger on Monday than in Texas, where some counties and school districts had retained mask mandates banned by Republican Governor Greg Abbott and others when schools reopened after the court ruling on Sunday. The state’s highest court order – which consisted entirely of elected Republican judges – halted the masking requirement introduced by Democrat-led district leaders in Dallas and San Antonio as new infections rose. The two cities – as well as other jurisdictions across Texas – were able to enforce the mandates through orders from lower courts. Dallas school officials were among those who opposed the court order, and in Austin, students and parents gathered outside the governor’s mansion to urge Abbott to abandon his opposition to the mandates. The Austin and Harris County School Districts, which include Houston, also said their school mask requirements remained in place. “We are waging war on a deadly virus on behalf of mothers and fathers and children,” said Clay Jenkins, Dallas District Judge. “I really wish the governor would join our side in the fight.” A Conservative cardinal who has spoken out against COVID vaccines and once said Catholics who voted for former President Barack Obama “worked with evil” is on a ventilator in a Wisconsin hospital with coronavirus . Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former Archbishop of St. Louis, has despised measures to prevent transmission of the virus, such as wearing masks and social distancing. It also promoted the misconception that vaccines contain a microchip implanted in recipients to control them. Burke, 73, announced on Tuesday via Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus. “Please pray for me as I begin my recovery,” the tweet read. “Let us trust in Divine Providence. Godd bless you.” A tweet on Saturday said Burke’s doctors were “encouraged by his progress.” With a big spike in coronavirus infections hit Florida early in the school year, school-age students rolled their arms for the COVID vaccine. Vaccinations in 12-19 year olds made up 20% of the doses in the state over the past two weeks, though that age group makes up only 9% of the total population. In the week of July 30th to August 5th, a total of 57,571 people between the ages of 12 and 19 were vaccinated in Florida, and another 55,083 the following week. That’s about twice as many as the 28,537 who received the vaccine in the week of July 9-15. “We encourage anyone who is of legal age to get the vaccine,” said Katherine Allen, government and community relations coordinator for Brevard Public Schools. “If you can, please do so.” – Dave Berman, Florida today The rise in the US Delta variant is entering a deadly new phase: the number of weekly fatalities is rising in more than three-quarters of the states. The latest record shows more than 4,800 deaths in a week, according to a US TODAY analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. That is more than three times the relative slack in early July. And the death toll is even worse because a large California county changed its methodology and removed hundreds of reported deaths from their lists. Coronavirus hospital admissions have reached a pandemic peak in all under-50s, report the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the total number of new infections is still increasing in almost all states. “We see how many people get seriously ill,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Biden government’s lead advisor on the pandemic, on Sunday in CBS’s Face the Nation, especially intensive care units. “ A rural Mississippi community is overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases two weeks after the Neshoba County Fair attracted thousands of people to attend shoulder-to-shoulder outdoor concerts, horse racing and political speeches. Republican Governor Tate Reeves spoke at the July 29 mass and told the crowd that the CDC was giving “foolish” and “harmful” advice and that the Mississippi “believe in freedom.” According to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 case tracker, Neshoba County had the highest COVID-19 case per capita in Mississippi and the 55th among any counties in the country on Friday. Mississippi has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the US – 36% in the state, compared to 50% across the country. As COVID-19 hospital admissions in Escambia County, Florida soar to levels previously unseen in the pandemic and schools are back up, the growing number of children hospitalized with the coronavirus worries experts . Studer Family Children’s Hospital pediatrician Jason Foland said he saw a two week old baby with COVID-19 go into cardiac arrest and recently seen more children, from newborns to teenagers in intensive care are or need intensive care. On Friday, 12 children were treated for COVID-19 in the county’s three major hospitals, out of 357 coronavirus-related hospitalizations. Pediatric cases are relatively low compared to the general population, but the delta variant makes the disease spread very easily among people, especially children at risk, Foland said. “(The parents are) scared and scared,” he said. “You know the odds here, right, you know that statistically very few kids get complications from COVID, but now it’s your child and now they’re really worried about it.” – Emma Kennedy, Pensacola News Journal Featuring: Mike Stucka, USA TODAY; The Associated Press."
Are we just ants in a death spiral? Researchers call for scientific studies of social media networks,8136,"Researchers at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public are examining the science behind social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others. (Jeremy Zero Photo via Unsplash) As misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines grows, the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public (CIP) is stepping up efforts to document, understand, and combat the rampant spread of unsubstantiated claims on social media platforms. The center announced today that it has received $ 2.25 million from a total of $ 3 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The money will be used to “develop and evaluate rapid response methods for studying and communicating about disinformation,” said Kate Starbird, an associate professor of human centered design and engineering at UW who will lead the project. The new initiative starts in October and includes support from Stanford University. The CIP has worked on similar issues. The UW was part of a cross-university team called Election Integrity Partnership founded in the summer of 2020, which monitored and shared incorrect and disinformation about the November elections that were disseminated on social media in real time. Launched in 2019, the CIP facilitates collaboration between professors in fields such as engineering, law, biology, and more to explore the powerful role that Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms play in global communication. Joseph Bak-Coleman, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public. (UW photo) In June, CIP’s Joseph Bak-Coleman was the lead author of a paper calling for the study of “collective behavior” – how we collect and share information and make decisions – to be elevated to the urgent status of “crisis discipline”. The research was a kind of call to arms to draw attention to the massive challenges posed by misinformation and communication networks. It was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “We have global problems that require global communication. We won’t fix global warming if we can’t talk to each other. So it is great that we have these tools to enable information to be disseminated around the world, ”he said. “Unfortunately, as they are currently being built and used, they don’t seem to be necessarily optimized for it. They are sales-optimized. “ In the face of the pandemic, national elections, climate crisis, and other events, social media platforms have been breeding grounds for confusion and worse. As vaccination rates lag behind and delta COVID increases, President Biden last month accused Facebook of “killing people” for failing to effectively contain the spread of falsehoods about vaccines. Biden later softened his message, but there are widespread calls for the platforms to be regulated more aggressively as the multi-billion dollar companies have had limited success in self-regulating inaccurate content. “It seems almost unreasonable to suggest that we can just let go of things and that an invisible hand will lead society into the happiest and healthiest future,” said Bak-Coleman, postdoctoral fellow. We met Bak-Coleman for an interview about his latest publication. Answers have been edited for clarity and length. GeekWire: Your background is biology and you see parallels between people engaging in social networks and biological systems. Can you explain? Bak-Coleman: I work in collective behavior, originally on schools of fish, but across species. And one of the things that we keep seeing is that animals often do these magical things, or things that seem like magical things – like flocks of birds deciding where to go, or fish that predators or locusts avoid that rave in unison – this is all simple local rules, and then the network structure allows [collective behavior] to emerge. One of the more haunting examples is ants following pheromone trails, and the rule they roughly obey is: if I smell a pheromone trail laid by an ant, I stick to it, which causes me to put it down as well. When they spin in circles, they can get stuck in a state of moving in circles until they all starve and die. It’s called ant mills or ant death coils. I learned this at the same time as the 2016 election, which was a wake-up call for many Americans that social media was making a difference. And I happened to be teaching conservation biology at the same time, so it all came together. GW: What’s the path to more responsible social media? Bak-Coleman: In the most optimistic part of my brain, I would hope that at some point companies will realize, and regulators and the public will have an awareness, that “Wow, this is one thing we can’t just monetize,” and then we have to find sustainable business models. This is my most optimistic self. I don’t know that this is the case with every company. Certainly Facebook shows that this is not the direction they want to go. So it could boil down to one of the regulators realizing that this type of chaotic social system is just a nightmare for the governance that may be a part of it. It could be the general public recognition that they don’t love the idea that big corporations regulate society and our interaction. Or maybe scientists can find clever ways to expose how damage is caused by these technologies. I think all of these things that come together will hopefully help create transparency. And then transparency ideally ensures more attention for what is happening and is a kind of feedback process. GW: How did social media companies evade regulation? Bak-Coleman: One of the things fossil fuel companies have done – and the same thing with tobacco companies and the Sackler family with opioids – is agnotology, trying to create insecurity. That’s your goal – you create doubt, enough uncertainty to avoid regulation. And then you put little patches on it. You put a filter on a cigarette and now you say it’s safe. I think companies are actually following the same playbook. If you are looking at this press release from Facebook [on July 17], it was filled with half-baked statistics. To say that 85% of Facebook users are interested in vaccines and all of this is almost like textbook disinformation trying to create the impression that this company has only done good. GW: You are calling for an “evidence-based administration” of communication networks. What does that mean? Bak-Coleman: All we are committed to is that scientists should start thinking about how the system works and how it is failing. And then we can allow the public and regulators to make informed decisions about our welfare systems. There are some basic things that we as scientists still don’t understand about how to build a healthy, large-scale communications network that is ideally profitable for the businesses that we need to figure out. We are not advocating a kind of technocracy or an elite-controlled social media system, on the contrary. We advocate an understanding that enables society as a whole to make informed decisions about how it ideally wants to design social media systems so that everyone has a voice and access to information. GW: What are the further implications if social media is no longer the main source of misinformation? Bak-Coleman: If we solve this problem, we will solve many other things as well. If we have a good, healthy information ecosystem, it shouldn’t be difficult to see leaders elected who advocate basic public health policies. Getting people to take safe, healthy, effective vaccines shouldn’t be difficult. On the one hand, it’s a tougher problem in some ways, but a lot of the reasons why climate change is so severe [to respond to] is because we don’t understand collective behavior and that is the goal we want to achieve. It’s a big problem and the problem is urgent, but we can move forward. And it might not be the full extent of utopia, but it could tweak recommendation algorithms to vaccinate more people, or it could avoid radicalization and stop genocide. We can make real tangible progress, probably pretty easily in large parts of it, even though the great healthy ecosystem may still be a little distant."
Silicon Valley should fight its stigma against military work – TechCrunch,4844,"Dr. Phil Wagner is the founder and CEO of Sparta Science. After studying medicine at USC, he was frustrated with the lack of evidence-based approaches to performance and injury prevention in sports, the military, and occupational medicine, which inspired him to start Sparta Science. During my medical training at LAC + USC Medical Center in the early 2000s, policy debate in the workplace was not encouraged. In the prison section on the 13th floor, we had a professional duty, like any other patient, to take care of drunk drivers and thieves and to give all opinions on criminal justice policy in the appropriate places. Medicine is not an isolated case in this regard – we are all better off when lawyers, soldiers and other public service providers put their duty to society above individual opinion. Technology companies often aim to take on similarly critical roles in society, but few have internalized the separation between professional duty and personal opinion. I experienced this firsthand as the founder of a technology company serving a wide variety of organizations, including amateur to college and professional sports, occupational medicine, and a growing list of military commandos. Many founders fail to explore DOD opportunities because they don’t want to be viewed as a war enterprise. During the President’s last term, a handful of colleagues wondered whether military service was compatible with our mission to help the world improve. In recent years, this stigma of military labor has stirred up some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, sometimes resulting in contract cancellations, non-renewal promises, and a noticeable deterrent to the work of the U.S. military. Partnerships between tech companies and the military are nothing new, but have rarely been discussed as controversially as they are today. These partnerships were the norm throughout the 20th century, spawning war-winning technologies – such as microwave radar, GPS, and ARPANET – that performed dual roles in peacetime as the building blocks of our modern networked world. Military contracts have traditionally been viewed as a win-win situation in Silicon Valley – for the country’s military superiority and for a company’s bottom line. Moonshot projects, which were funded by the federal government, also represented some of the most interesting workarounds for product-oriented technologists. That relationship has been thrown off the rails in recent years as employees from Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, among others, tried to distance themselves from all federal projects because the previous government’s policies were rejected. But with the new leadership in Washington, corporations and technicians will have to determine whether the stigma against military labor is ingrained permanently or confined to one chapter in an evolving relationship. Before looking ahead, it’s worth correcting a common misconception by the previous government about tensions between staff and the military. Recent research challenges the notion that anti-military attitudes are universal among the tech workforce. In a survey conducted between late 2019 and early 2020, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University found that less than a quarter of AI experts see Pentagon’s work negatively and 78% see it as positive or neutral. Companies open to pursuing opportunities with the Department of Defense should consider various benefits and differences between commercial and government customers. Federal contracts are generally characterized by large dollar amounts, low profit margins, and long terms. This can appeal to VC-backed businesses that are valued by revenue, and the unique structure of government contracts is a welcome addition to the lucrative but highly volatile work in the B2B and B2C markets. The merging of the two extremes creates a stronger whole, much like mutual funds that balance stocks and bonds. Many founders fail to explore DOD opportunities because they don’t want to be viewed as a war enterprise. We came across a version of this with colleagues at Sparta Science who merged our work in assisting federal employees with full support for all government policies. The reality is more nuanced. The DOD has an annual budget of more than half a trillion dollars and employs 2.8 million people. Only a fraction of these people are directly involved in the warfare, and they rely on large numbers of administrators and knowledge experts to complete each mission. At any given time, the DOD has approximately 1.3 million active contracts in fields as diverse as healthcare, apparel, logistics, and software licensing. The military is rightly referred to as a cross section of the United States, and helping those who serve is Silicon Valley tradition, good business practice, and the right thing to do."
Edtech’s next mission: Go everywhere – TechCrunch,4854,"Thank you for reading Startups Weekly. Would you like the weekly summary in your inbox every Saturday? Login here. Last week, edtech entrepreneurs, investors and analysts gathered at ASU + GSV, an annual global edtech conference, to reflect on the sector’s newly-discovered limelight following the massive shock of COVID-19. Aside from the masked excitement of finally meeting Twitter friends in real life, there were signs of bullism everywhere. A digital-first talent development platform for interns who previously had no product market fit won the startup trophy. My panels were all with newly minted startup unicorns. And not everyone knew everyone, an achievement that shows how the conference has evolved from a niche industry get-together to a broader event for a new generation of founders. However, my conclusion from the whole week was more than Edtech is booming (which is what it is). Instead, I felt that the general mood at the conference, even if politely disapproved, was such that the sector that is being spotlighted finally has consent to go anywhere. In other words, Edtech has reached a point where it doesn’t have to rely solely on itself to achieve its goals. It can operate outside of a silo, which feels like the necessary continuation of the sector’s 2020. For example, if a platform brings fun of UX to online teaching but doesn’t take into account how that move affects childcare, mental health, and the digital divide, the impact of its clever solution will be immediately limited. The consolidation that will continue due to freshly minted unicorns will not only be Edtech taking Edtech in, but you may see companies start to bring products to market that take into account the entire human experience. BetterUp, a retraining and coaching platform for employees before and beyond the C-Suite, signals that it is already happening. The edtech company announced it is digging deeper into behavioral health with new products. Acting beyond Edtech insiders is the difference between developing products that reinforce the status quo and inventing products that turn the status quo upside down. Fiveable, a virtual space for high school students to learn and express, has interned dozens of its users. The feedback loop there is brutal – high schoolers are tough – but it means that the people who make decisions for them are finally not adults talking to adults. The lack of training wheels, of course, means it’s easier for startups to break away. With the pandemic developing unevenly, distance learning can become normal again. Businesses need to focus heavily on their reach and be humble. It will be important to reflect on what distinguishes a Course Hero from a Codecademy to a Coursera – and when it makes sense to leave your own track. It was a refreshing, surreal week talking to the people behind the dollars and ideas of our future educational landscape. The shock of the pandemic has highlighted the injustices and the work still to be done. Now the spotlight will be part cheerleading and part accountability coach to help Edtech reflect on its path to a better end product.

When tigers eat your lunch, where do you look for competitive advantage and relevance? Here’s what you should know: Some think venture capital is dead. Others think it’s more nuanced.

Best grill brushes of 2021,5770,"
CNN
– Whether you’re making a serving of hamburger or slow-boiling ribs with barbecue sauce on your charcoal grill, you know grilling can get pretty messy. Cleaning your grill after each use is an important step in making sure that your grill is being well looked after – and also that you are removing any potentially harmful residue from burned parts from your most recent grilling. But not all grill brushes are created equal. In fact, using a wire brush to clean your grill can be harmful to your health. So we started looking for the best grill brush without wire bristles. We spent weeks testing a handful of the top rated wire free grill brushes to find the one that cleans the best. The Kona BBQ Grill Brush is our first choice as it is the most effective and safest way to clean your grill. Best grill brush overall The Kona BBQ grill brush has a durable, large stainless steel brush head that cleans your grill effectively and safely. CNN Kona BBQ grill brush. The Kona BBQ grill brush has a durable stainless steel brush head that, according to the manufacturer, works best when submerged in water. This has been confirmed in our tests and the wet brush melts away leftover food or dirt on the grill. The solid brush head ensures that no bristles, pieces of wire, food scraps or residues from the tools are left on your grill. The surface area of ​​the brush head is quite large so it won’t take long to clean your grill surface. It also has a longer handle than most brushes so you can clean your grill while it’s still hot. In our tests, we’ve found this to be the most effective brush for cleaning our grills. We spent weeks grilling dozens of burgers and chicken drumsticks to test our pool of grill brushes – but after all that we decided the grills just weren’t messy enough. For our last test, we coated ribs with barbecue sauce and let them do their thing on our grills. We used different types of grill for this test – a Weber Spirit three-burner gas grill with a flat cast iron grate, and traditional charcoal kettle grills with stainless steel grids and porcelain-coated wire grids. We cleaned the grills several times with each brush to see how effectively they clean on the different types of cooking grids. Each brush cleans the grill in a unique way, so some of the brushes require additional steps, like dipping in water or wiping the grill after using a stone that leaves residue. We took all of these factors into account when we selected the Kona BBQ Grill Brush as the best wireless grill brush on the market right now. Char Broil nylon bristle grill brush ($ 14.98; lowes.com)
We found the Char Broil nylon bristle brush to work well when it came to cleaning the grill, but due to the material of the bristles, it can only be used on a chilled grill surface. The brush has lab-tested extra long red nylon bristles that work well when cleaning, but we’ve found that they hold onto dirt off your grill when you’re done. In order to ensure that you do not leave any dirt on the surfaces when you are finished with this brush, and to prevent dirt build-up, this grill brush must be cleaned thoroughly after each use. EarthStone Grill Cleaning Pad ($ 5.98; homedepot.com)
The EarthStone Grill Cleaning Block is just that and nothing more – it’s a stone block that you use to clean the surface of your grill. The one we tested came without a handle, which means you have to hold it in your hand when cleaning the grill. It can be used on both hot and cold grilling surfaces, but since your hand is very close to the grill grate, we recommend that you only use it on your grill after it has cooled down. The stone cleans well and removes dirt from the grill, but leaves white residue on both the grill surface and your hand. The stone is said to be made of “recycled material” that is non-toxic and free of chemicals. You can choose to purchase an EarthStone cleaning block with a handle, which is what we recommend. Chafing stone ($ 9.74; homedepot.com)
Much like the EarthStone, the Scrubbin ‘Stone is a cleaning block that can be used to clean hot or cold grills – and requires you to wipe your grill down when you use it. Scrubbin ‘Stone says their brush is made from recycled, heated glass and that the stone is also non-toxic and chemical-free. The one we tested came with a handle that was a nice upgrade to the EarthStone cleaning block. Again, these stones require the extra step of wiping the stone scraps off the grill when you’re done. But if you are comfortable with it then this is an effective way to clean your grill. BBQ floss ($ 22.30; amazon.com)
Grill Floss is a sleek, nifty tool that literally wraps every wire on the grill grate with dental floss. The stainless steel tool wraps itself tightly around each rung of your grillage, so you can achieve 360-degree cleaning. However, this means you have to manually clean each and every wire rung, which takes time and can feel cumbersome. The appliance comes with three different head attachments for different sized grill grids, but it’s worth noting that none of the Weber gas grills do this as they have flat, cast iron grids. It also comes at a higher price than other cleaning tools we tested. Cuisinart Wooden Scraper ($ 14.99; amazon.com)
The Cuisinart wooden scraper is a solid piece of beech wood that you rub along your grill and, in theory, should be shaped so that it fits exactly into the grooves of your grillage. However, after testing several times within a few weeks, we could hardly leave a dent in the wood and therefore found this to be the least effective cleaning tool that we tested on our grills. The tool is noticeably larger than other grill brushes and the dirt from your grill will stick to the bottom of the paddle. Read more from CNN Underscored:"
Texas Hospitals Are Already Overloaded. Doctors Are ‘Frightened by What Is Coming.’,2071,"Dr. Abhishek Patel, who works in the hospital’s pediatric intensive care unit, walked in and out of a room where a 6-month-old and a 2-month-old child were battling severe Covid-19 infections and breathing with the help of supplemental oxygen. This week alone, he said, two teenagers with other underlying health problems succumbed to the virus. In a nearby room, Cerena Gonzales, 14, groaned in pain. Last week she was an excited teen looking forward to starting her first year of high school. On Tuesday she was surrounded by hospital equipment. She and her younger sister fell ill after their parents Carlos Gonzales, 47, and his wife Elizabeth, 42, suffered from symptoms of Covid and were rushed to the hospital. Neither of them had been vaccinated, Ms. Gonzales said. “We hesitated,” said Ms. Gonzales. “We were all a healthy family” As soon as she was released, Ms. Gonzales, who was still breathing with the help of two portable oxygen cylinders, rushed to her daughter’s side. She stroked her daughter’s forehead and tried to keep her happy. She tearfully recalled the harrowing scene days ago when doctors put her on a speakerphone so she could hear her daughter being intubated. “I thought I was going to lose my mind,” said Ms. Gonzales. “I couldn’t be with her.” On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Gonzales said she believed the worst of the crisis was over. She untangled her daughter’s thick black hair from IV tubes and gently encouraged her to drink orange juice. Several members of her family have been hit by the virus, she said, and she is now planning to organize a family trip to get vaccinated. “There’s no reason parents should go through this,” she said. Nearby, Anne Marie Baker, a pediatric nurse, had the grim task of cleaning a room where a teenager had recently died of the virus. Mrs. Baker took off her mask and dropped into a chair to catch her breath. Children under the age of 12 who have not yet qualified for a vaccine are at greatest risk, she said. “We’ve only had all of these patients in the last two months,” she said. “It’s just so sad.”"
Expedia Group pushes back its full return to the office to January 2022,1686,"At Expedia Group’s Seattle headquarters before moving to new premises in 2019. (GeekWire photo / Kurt Schlosser) This seems to be a trend: Expedia Group, the Seattle-based online travel giant, has told employees that it will postpone the full return to the office until early next year. Expedia’s decision follows a similar announcement from Amazon last week. Microsoft, Google, Apple, and others have also postponed their return to the office, but in a shorter timeframe for now. October is currently the more common destination for many in the industry. “Due to the evolving circumstances surrounding COVID-19, we are now aiming to largely return to the office on a hybrid basis in January 2022, subject to instructions from local governments and health authorities,” Expedia said in a statement. “The well-being of our employees is our priority and we look forward to reuniting our global employee community when it is safe to do so.” Meanwhile, the company says its offices are open to those who can walk in, “while maintaining flexibility and reasonable security standards.” At this point, the company says employees and visitors who come to its U.S. offices must be vaccinated. “We have employees in 55 countries, we will continue to evaluate the situation outside of the US and consider a similar approach as local laws allow this and vaccines become more available,” an Expedia spokesperson said. In addition to the flagship Expedia.com, the Expedia Group includes travel brands such as vrbo, Orbitz, Hotwire, Trivago, Hotels.com and Egencia. The company moved from its long-standing home in downtown Bellevue, Washington, to a spacious headquarters in downtown Seattle in 2019."

Opinion | Universal Masking Can Protect Students From Covid,6064,"Big questions arise in the upcoming back-to-school season: Do children have to wear masks? Should the children even go to face-to-face classes? If we send children to school without masks, we increase their risk of developing Covid-19. Some could get sick or die. If we close schools, millions of children will experience learning loss, and many of them can have lifelong effects on their physical and mental health. For more than a year, we’ve worked with school districts and charter schools in North Carolina to investigate the rate of new Covid cases, the effectiveness of mitigation measures like masking, and the increased risks of participating in school-sponsored sports. We’ve learned a couple of things for sure: While vaccination is the best way to prevent Covid-19, universal masking comes second, and with masking, school learning is safe and more effective than distance learning regardless of community infection rates. Vaccination is the most powerful way to prevent the negative effects of Covid, but students under the age of 12 are not eligible for the vaccines. Masking is therefore one of the best and easiest methods available to protect them from the disease, with universal masking being one of the most effective and efficient strategies to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. Universal masking in schools can save lives. Voluntary masking in schools is likely to be much less effective and could lead to school closings and community transfers. This summer, we saw voluntary masking fail at some schools in Missouri and North Carolina, leading to an increase in Covid-19 cases and missed days due to quarantines, prompting several counties to restore mask mandates. Opinion interview
Questions about the Covid-19 vaccine and its introduction. How do we know that masking helps prevent the spread among unvaccinated people in schools? In July 2020, we and our colleagues developed the ABC Science Collaborative to bring scientists together with school and community leaders to ensure school leaders have the most up-to-date scientific information on Covid-19 and K-12 schools. Working with North Carolina, the ABC Science Collaborative collected data from more than one million students and staff in the state’s schools from March to June 2021. Certain school districts in North Carolina were required by bipartisan law to submit infection data to the ABC Science Collaborative as a trusted third party. During that time, more than 7,000 children and adults contracted the coronavirus and attended school while contagious. Due to the close contact with these cases, more than 40,000 people have had to be quarantined. However, through contact tracing and testing, we only found 363 additional children and adults infected with the coronavirus. We assume that this low transmission rate is due to the mask-on-mask school environment: Both the infected person and the close contacts wore masks. Schools offered this protection without expensive screening tests for the coronavirus or massive overhauls of ventilation systems. Since North Carolina had a mask mandate for all K-12 schools, we couldn’t compare masked schools to unmasked schools. To understand what preventive masks can have, we looked outside of North Carolina for comparisons. Data from our research and studies done in Utah, Missouri, and Wisconsin show that school transmission rates of the coronavirus were low when schools enforced masking requirements. In contrast, a school in Israel with no mask requirement or adequate social distancing protocols reported a Covid-19 outbreak involving 153 students and 25 staff. The recent outbreaks in youth camps in Texas, Illinois and Florida show how quickly Covid-19 can spread among largely exposed and mostly unvaccinated teenagers and adults, with the possibility of spreading to surrounding communities. The potential for this type of community expansion was the reason schools closed their doors in March 2020. Now that it is clear that universal masking is associated with less spread, why not demand universal masking? Why try to gather hundreds of unvaccinated, unmasked people in a closed room for several hours a day, five days a week? Schools that don’t require masks will transmit more coronavirus. And while the April Covid mortality rate of more than 50 million public school children in the US was just two per 100,000 school-age children, that could still mean many preventable child deaths in a year. Once vaccination is available to all children, districts can best serve their students by providing incentives to promote masking and vaccination. For example, if universal masking is enforced or a student is being vaccinated, it is reasonable for schools to choose not to require quarantine or post-exposure testing for asymptomatic children and adults. Similarly, schools may consider allowing vaccinated students participating in extracurricular activities to continue even after exposure to someone who tests positive. School districts that do not have universal masking should continue to employ strategies such as ventilation and social distancing, and continue to conduct routine tests for unvaccinated students. A spike in Covid is likely in schools that choose to open without a mask requirement and with limited vaccine intake. Until all children can be vaccinated, masks remain a well-researched solution for reducing the risk of Covid infection. Children should be in school and we should take the measures that can protect them. Kanecia Zimmerman is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine.

More than 99.99% of fully vaccinated people have not had a severe breakthrough case of Covid-19,3023,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues, lambda infections have emerged in the United States, including Texas, where the Houston Methodist Hospital reported its first case last month. There’s still a lot to learn about Lambda, but here’s what we know so far: So far it is rare in the US: The variant is nowhere near as worrying as the US Delta variant, which has seen a spike in cases nationwide, but early studies suggest it has mutations that make it more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. “Lambda has worrying mutations, but this variant remains quite rare in the US despite its months of presence,” wrote Dr. Preeti Malani, chief health officer in the Infectious Diseases Division at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, in an email to An on Friday. We’re not sure how transferable it is: it “It’s hard to say how transmissible lambda is and how well vaccines work. So far, lambda appears to be more transmissible than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, ”which resembles Delta and other variants, wrote Malani, an expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. Fortunately, studies suggest that the vaccines currently available are still protective. We learned during the pandemic that things can change quickly, so controlling the spread of COVID-19 in general will help tackle Lambda, ”Malani wrote. “As long as there is an uncontrolled spread of SARS-CoV-2, we will see further variants in the future. The only way out is widespread vaccination to control the spread and prevent further mutation of SARS-CoV-2. There is a race between sufficient vaccination in the world and the development of new variants that are less responsive to countermeasures. “ About vaccines: So far, the data has been divided on how well vaccines protect against the lambda variant, and scientists say they need to look into this more closely. In July, researchers wrote in a laboratory study that they found some evidence that people who received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 single-dose vaccine could benefit from a booster dose to better protect them from new variants of the coronavirus, including lambda Variant to protect. The study was done in the laboratory and does not reflect the real-world effects of the vaccine – and is pre-printed online on the biorxiv.org server, which means it has not undergone careful peer review. Nathaniel Landau of New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine and colleagues said their blood tests on vaccinated volunteers showed that at least some of the emerging variants could bypass the protection of a single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. Increasing a second dose of the J&J vaccine, or even that of Moderna or Pfizer, could help, the researchers reported. In the study, the Beta, Delta, Delta plus and Lambda variants showed only “modest” resistance to antibodies produced by the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines, suggesting that the vaccines are still working."
Pediatric hospitals filling up as delta variant surges: COVID updates,8916,"Children’s hospitals fill with coronavirus patients as schools begin to open amid the recent surge in infections fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant. Children’s hospitals in Tennessee will be full by the end of this week, the state health department predicted, and the number of children admitted to a children’s hospital in Jacksonville, Florida in July was more than four times as high as in June. Schools allow students, maskless or with masks, back into the classroom. And some schools close as soon as they open their doors. One district in Mississippi reported 114 COVID-19 positive students for the week of July 24-30 and 608 students in quarantine, pushing two high schools and one middle school to virtual learning by August 16. Children in a pre-K classroom in Georgia were sent home Thursday after potential contact with a person who tested positive at school. Another school in Tennessee postponed the start of the school year for a week because of a number of COVID-19 cases among staff. In Austin, Texas, children with symptomatic COVID-19 are also getting sicker and having more severe symptoms than previous waves of the disease. “That shouldn’t be happening,” said Dr. Meena Iyer, Chief Medical Officer at Dell Children’s Medical Center in Central Texas. Also on the news: ►Scaling coronavirus cases are filling beds in U.S. hospitals, which are re-admitting more than 100,000 likely COVID patients each week, according to USA TODAY analysis of U.S. health and social services data. Hospitals reported 66,390 likely COVID-19 patients in beds on Saturday, up from 20,184 just four weeks earlier. Far more coronavirus sufferers were in the intensive care unit: around 15,900 compared to around 4,900 four weeks earlier.

May require passengers to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination when boarding Florida cruises – at least for now. Late Sunday the company, parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises, received an injunction from U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams temporarily blocking Florida’s law prohibiting cruise lines from showing evidence of a COVID-19 vaccine to ask to get in. “This contract will now enable the company to operate in the safest possible manner with a 100% vaccination of all guests and crew members when sailing from ports in Florida,” the cruise line said in a press release. – Morgan Hines Canada opened its border to vaccinated U.S. citizens on Monday after allowing only essential travel for more than a year. Detroit’s ports to Canada were not congested early Monday. Waiting times for the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor tunnel were around 10 minutes. Americans must test negative for COVID-19 within three days to gain passage across one of the world’s busiest land borders. Passengers must also fill out a detailed application in the “arriveCAN” app before the crossing. The US has extended its closure to all Canadians who do non-essential travel until at least August 21st. The same date applies to the Mexican border. The moment couldn’t come sooner for loved ones who were separated throughout the pandemic. Asawari Kaur of Indiana huddled in Detroit’s duty-free shop with her family minutes before midnight. Some of Kaur’s family hadn’t seen their brother, who had married in April, for almost two years. “We have all been waiting so longingly for this day,” said Kaur. – Eve Chen and Minnah Arshad Temporary monuments have sprung up all over the US – 250,000 white flags in the former Washington Football Team Stadium in the country’s capital, a garden of hand-carved flowers in Florida, origami cranes in Los Angeles. However, the process of creating more lasting memories honoring the more than 600,000 Americans who have died from the coronavirus is strained for political reasons compared to previous memorial services. Last year, a bill kicking off a national COVID-19 memorial process died in Congress as the Trump administration tried to mitigate the ravages of the pandemic. Non-pandemic memorials – like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and the National Sept. 11 Memorial in New York – are the result of negotiations between various stakeholders willing to instigate controversy to create common Elaborating narratives, said Nancy Bristow, a history professor at the University of Puget Sound. A national COVID-19 memorial won’t be that unique, she said. “The problem and power of memorials is that they tell the story we want to tell and they may have nothing to do with learning from the past or remembering the complexities of what we went through” said Bristow. “Remembrance and commemoration has nothing to do with nuances.” A doctor from Tennessee struggled to find a nearby hospital with specialized care to help a young patient with coronavirus – a candidate for intensive therapy for COVID-19 patients when a ventilator isn’t enough. A machine was available, but the staff needed for therapy were not available. Dr. Jason Martin, an intensive care doctor at Sumner Regional Medical Center in Gallatin, Tennessee, said he would have to search “as far as Cincinnati” to find a hospital that has both the equipment and the staff to help his patient. “What we feel as practitioners is that there is no bed availability, and that manifests itself in a number of ways,” said Martin. “In a community hospital like the one I work at in Sumner County, there are some cases where patients need special attention and move to a larger hospital … if this is affected because COVID eats up the extra capacity, they suffer Patient. “ The Delta variant is “everywhere,” putting additional pressure on low-staffed hospitals, Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said on Aug. 2. Hospital stays are approaching those seen in February when the state saw another spike in COVID-19 cases. As of Aug. 7, 14% of bunk beds in Tennessee hospitals and 10% of ICU beds were available, according to the state. – Cassandra Stephenson, Nashville, Tennessee Heidi Kim, an Arizona mother of two, learned that her 5-year-old daughter tested positive for COVID-19 within two weeks of sending her children to school. Last school year, the two were home-schooled to protect family members from contracting the virus. Kim and her husband were reluctant to send their children to personal school, she told Good Morning America. “I was really nervous about sending them back there, but I was hoping they might be eligible for the vaccine in September,” said Kim. “I was hoping it would just be the month and a few extra weeks depending on when it comes.” On June 30, Governor Goud Ducey signed law banning mask requirements in Arizona schools, an action carried out in seven other states to restrict the use of masks in educational institutions. Kim said that although masks were encouraged, only two other kindergarten children wore masks in school. “It’s incredibly frustrating because I think schools should absolutely be open. I don’t think people will have to put their lives on hold for a year and a half,” said Kim. “If we look at what public health is telling us, if you look at the American Academy of Pediatrics or the CDC, everyone is saying schools should be open. But people who aren’t vaccinated should wear masks too.” – Steven Vargas Contribution: The Associated Press"
"Amid COVID surge, Amazon to require masks for warehouse workers regardless of vaccination status",1942,"An Amazon employee walks into a fulfillment center in Kent, Washington and is handed a mask by another employee with a pair of pliers before starting a shift in the huge parcel handling warehouse last June. (GeekWire file photo / Kurt Schlosser) A day after its office workers’ return to a personal environment was postponed until the New Year, Amazon issued new masking guidelines for its warehouse workers as concerns about the spread of COVID-19 variants continue to affect decisions in the workplace. Amazon on Friday told hundreds of thousands of workers at its fulfillment facilities that regardless of whether or not they received a COVID-19 vaccine, they should return to wearing masks to work. “In response to the worrying spread of new COVID-19 variants in the US and instructions from health authorities and our own medical experts, we are calling for face coverings indoors regardless of vaccination status,” said Kelly Nantel, Amazon’s national media relations director, in a statement opposite GeekWire. On Thursday, Amazon announced to its corporate and tech employees that the date they would return to regular office work would now be January 3, 2022, four months above the previous target of the week of September 7. The tech giant has failed to implement a vaccination mandate for those who work in the office like companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have. According to Amazon, office workers are required to wear masks except for those who can show they are fully vaccinated. More than a year after Amazon turned its warehouses into showcases for the COVID security measures it implemented such as on-site testing, temperature controls, signage, endless hand sanitizer, social distancing cameras, cleaning, and more, Amazon had begun some of these processes to relax. Natel said the company will continue to “follow instructions from the local government and work closely with leading healthcare professionals.”"
"In-app events hit the App Store, TikTok tries Stories, Apple reveals new child safety plan – TechCrunch",22041,"Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app industry continues to grow, with a record 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also spent 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors poured $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too. Do you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here: techcrunch.com/newsletters Apple announced a major initiative to scan devices for CSAM imagery. The company on Thursday announced a new set of features, arriving later this year, that will detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in its cloud and report it to law enforcement. Companies like Dropbox, Google and Microsoft already scan for CSAM in their cloud services, but Apple had allowed users to encrypt their data before it reached iCloud. Now, Apple’s new technology, NeuralHash, will run on users’ devices, tatformso detect when a users upload known CSAM imagery — without having to first decrypt the images. It even can detect the imagery if it’s been cropped or edited in an attempt to avoid detection. Meanwhile, on iPhone and iPad, the company will roll out protections to Messages app users that will filter images and alert children and parents if sexually explicit photos are sent to or from a child’s account. Children will not be shown the images but will instead see a grayed-out image instead. If they try to view the image anyway through the link, they’ll be shown interruptive screens that explain why the material may be harmful and are warned that their parents will be notified. Some privacy advocates pushed back at the idea of such a system, believing it could expand to end-to-end encrypted photos, lead to false positives, or set the stage for more on-device government surveillance in the future. But many cryptology experts believe the system Apple developed provides a good balance between privacy and utility, and have offered their endorsement of the technology. In addition, Apple said reports are manually reviewed before being sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). The changes may also benefit iOS developers who deal in user photos and uploads, as predators will no longer store CSAM imagery on iOS devices in the first place, given the new risk of detection. Image Credits: Apple Though not yet publicly available to all users, those testing the new iOS 15 mobile operating system got their first glimpse of a new App Store discovery feature this week: “in-app events.” First announced at this year’s WWDC, the feature will allow developers and Apple editors alike to showcase directly on the App Store upcoming events taking place inside apps. The events can appear on the App Store homepage, on the app’s product pages or can be discovered through personalized recommendations and search. In some cases, editors will curate events to feature on the App Store. But developers will also be provided tools to submit their own in-app events. TikTok’s “Summer Camp” for creators was one of the first in-app events to be featured, where it received a top spot on the iPadOS 15 App Store. Apple expands support for student IDs on iPhone and Apple Watch ahead of the fall semester. Tens of thousands more U.S. and Canadian colleges will now support mobile student IDs in the Apple Wallet app, including Auburn University, Northern Arizona University, University of Maine, New Mexico State University and others. Apple was accused of promoting scam apps in the App Store’s featured section. The company’s failure to properly police its store is one thing, but to curate an editorial list that actually includes the scams is quite another. One of the games rounded up under “Slime Relaxations,” an already iffy category to say the least, was a subscription-based slime simulator that locked users into a $13 AUD per week subscription for its slime simulator. One of the apps on the curated list didn’t even function, implying that Apple’s editors hadn’t even tested the apps they recommend. Tax changes hit the App Store. Apple announced tax and price changes for apps and IAPs in South Africa, the U.K. and all territories using the Euro currency, all of which will see decreases. Increases will occur in Georgia and Tajikistan, due to new tax changes. Proceeds on the App Store in Italy will be increased to reflect a change to the Digital Services Tax effective rate. Game Center changes, too. Apple said that on August 4, a new certificate for server-based Game Center verification will be available via the publicKeyUrl.

Coinbase’s app now lets you buy your cryptocurrency using Apple Pay. The company previously made its Coinbase Card compatible with Apple Pay in June. An anonymous app called Sendit, which relies on Snap Kit to function, is climbing the charts of the U.S. App Store after Snap suspended similar apps, YOLO and LMK. Snap was sued by the parent of child who was bullied through those apps, which led to his suicide. Sendit also allows for anonymity, and reviews compare it to YOLO. But some reviews also complained about bullying. This isn’t the first time Snap has been involved in a lawsuit related to a young person’s death related to its app. The company was also sued for its irresponsible “speed filter” that critics said encouraged unsafe driving. Three young men died using the filter, which captured them doing 123 mph. TikTok is testing Stories. As Twitter’s own Stories integrations, Fleets, shuts down, TikTok confirmed it’s testing its own Stories product. The TikTok Stories appear in a left-hand sidebar and allow users to post ephemeral images or video that disappear in 24 hours. Users can also comment on Stories, which are public to their mutual friends and the creator. Stories on TikTok may make more sense than they did on Twitter, as TikTok is already known as a creative platform and it gives the app a more familiar place to integrate its effects toolset and, eventually, advertisements. Facebook has again re-arranged its privacy settings. The company continually moves around where its privacy features are located, ostensibly to make them easier to find. But users then have to re-learn where to go to find the tools they need, after they had finally memorized the location. This time, the settings have been grouped into six top-level categories, but “privacy” settings have been unbundled from one location to be scattered among the other categories. A VICE report details ban-as-a-service operations that allow anyone to harass or censor online creators on Instagram. Assuming you can find it, one operation charged $60 per ban, the listing says. TikTok merged personal accounts with creator accounts. The change means now all non-business accounts on TikTok will have access to the creator tools under Settings, including Analytics, Creator Portal, Promote and Q&A. TikTok shared the news directly with subscribers of its TikTok Creators newsletter in August, and all users will get a push notification alerting them to the change, the company told us. Discord now lets users customize their profile on its apps. The company added new features to its iOS and Android apps that let you add a description, links and emojis and select a profile color. Paid subscribers can also choose an image or GIF as their banner. Twitter Spaces added a co-hosting option that allows up to two co-hosts to be added to the live audio chat rooms.

New rules address how companies handle user data collection and storage, antitrust behavior and other checks on capitalist “excess.” The gaming industry is now worried it’s next to be impacted, with regulations that would restrict gaming for minors to fight addiction. WhatsApp is adding a new feature that will allow users to send photos and videos that disappear after a single viewing. The Snapchat-inspired feature, however, doesn’t alert you if the other person takes a screenshot — as Snap’s app does. So it may not be ideal for sharing your most sensitive content. Telegram’s update expands group video calls to support up to 1,000 viewers. It also announced video messages can be recorded in higher quality and can be expanded, regular videos can be watched at 0.5 or 2x speed, screen sharing with sound is available for all video calls, including 1-on-1 calls, and more. American Airlines added free access to TikTok aboard its Viasat-equipped aircraft. Passengers will be able to watch the app’s videos for up to 30 minutes for free and can even download the app if it’s not already installed. After the free time, they can opt to pay for Wi-Fi to keep watching. Considering how easy it is to fall into multi-hour TikTok viewing sessions without knowing it, the addition of the addictive app could make long plane rides feel shorter. Or at least less painful. Chinese TikTok rival Kuaishou saw stocks fall by more than 15% in Hong Kong, the most since its February IPO. The company is another victim of an ongoing market selloff triggered by increasing investor uncertainty related to China’s recent crackdown on tech companies. Beijing’s campaign to rein in tech has also impacted Tencent, Alibaba, Jack Ma’s Ant Group, food delivery company Meituan and ride-hailing company Didi. Also related, Kuaishou shut down its controversial app Zynn, which had been paying users to watch its short-form videos, including those stolen from other apps. Twitch overtook YouTube in consumer spending per user in April 2021, and now sees $6.20 per download as of June compared with YouTube’s $5.60, Sensor Tower found. Image Credits: Sensor Tower Spotify confirmed tests of a new ad-supported tier called Spotify Plus, which is only $0.99 per month and offers unlimited skips (like free users get on the desktop) and the ability to play the songs you want, instead of only being forced to use shuffle mode. The company also noted in a forum posting that it’s no longer working on AirPlay2 support, due to “audio driver compatibility” issues. Mark Cuban-backed audio app Fireside asked its users to invest in the company via an email sent to creators which didn’t share deal terms. The app has yet to launch. YouTube kicks off its $100 million Shorts Fund aimed at taking on TikTok by providing creators with cash incentives for top videos. Creators will get bonuses of $100 to $10,000 based on their videos’ performance. Match Group announced during its Q2 earnings it plans to add to several of the company’s brands over the next 12 to 24 months audio and video chat, including group live video, and other livestreaming technologies. The developments will be powered by innovations from Hyperconnect, the social networking company that this year became Match’s biggest acquisition to date when it bought the Korean app maker for a sizable $1.73 billion. Since then, Match was spotted testing group live video on Tinder, but says that particular product is not launching in the near-term. At least two brands will see Hyperconnect-powered integrations in 2021. The Photo & Video category on U.S. app stores saw strong growth in the first half of the year, a Sensor Tower report found. Consumer spend among the top 100 apps grew 34% YoY to $457 million in Q2 2021, with the majority of the revenue (83%) taking place on iOS. Image Credits: Sensor Tower Epic Games revealed the host of its in-app Rift Tour event is Ariana Grande, in the event that runs August 6-8. Pokémon GO influencers threatened to boycott the game after Niantic removed the COVID safety measures that had allowed people to more easily play while social distancing. Niantic’s move seemed ill-timed, given the Delta variant is causing a new wave of COVID cases globally. Apple kicked out an app called Unjected from the App Store. The new social app billed itself as a community for the unvaccinated, allowing like-minded users to connect for dating and friendships. Apple said the app violated its policies for COVID-19 content. Google Pay expanded support for vaccine cards. In Australia, Google’s payments app now allows users to add their COVID-19 digital certification to their device for easy access. The option is available through Google’s newly updated Passes API which lets government agencies distribute digital versions of vaccine cards. COVID Tech Connect, a U.S. nonprofit initially dedicated to collecting devices like phones and tablets for COVID ICU patients, has now launched its own app. The app, TeleHome, is a device-agnostic, HIPAA-compliant way for patients to place a video call for free at a time when the Delta variant is again filling ICU wards, this time with the unvaccinated — a condition that sometimes overlaps with being low-income. Some among the working poor have been hesitant to get the shot because they can’t miss a day of work, and are worried about side effects. Which is why the Biden administration offered a tax credit to SMBs who offered paid time off to staff to get vaccinated and recover. Popular journaling app Day One, which was recently acquired by WordPress.com owner Automattic, rolled out a new “Concealed Journals” feature that lets users hide content from others’ viewing. By tapping the eye icon, the content can be easily concealed on a journal by journal basis, which can be useful for those who write to their journal in public, like coffee shops or public transportation. Recently IPO’d language learning app Duolingo is developing a math app for kids. The company says it’s still “very early” in the development process, but will announce more details at its annual conference, Duocon, later this month. Educational publisher Pearson launched an app that offers U.S. students access to its 1,500 titles for a monthly subscription of $14.99. the Pearson+ mobile app (ack, another +), also offers the option of paying $9.99 per month for access to a single textbook for a minimum of four months. Quora jumps into the subscription economy. Still not profitable from ads alone, Quora announced two new products that allow its expert creators to monetize their content on its service. With Quora+ ($5/mo or $50/yr), subscribers can pay for any content that a creator paywalls. Creators can choose to enable a adaptive paywall that will use an algorithm to determine when to show the paywall. Another product, Spaces, lets creators write paywalled publications on Quora, similar to Substack. But only a 5% cut goes to Quora, instead of 10% on Substack. Google Maps on iOS added a new live location-sharing feature for iMessage users, allowing them to more easily show your ETA with friends and even how much battery life you have left. The feature competes with iMessage’s built-in location-sharing feature, and offers location sharing of 1 hour up to 3 days. The app also gained a dark mode. Controversial crime app Citizen launched a $20 per month “Protect” service that includes live agent support (who can refer calls to 911 if need be). The agents can gather your precise location, alert your designated emergency contacts, help you navigate to a safe location and monitor the situation until you feel safe. The system of live agent support is similar to in-car or in-home security and safety systems, like those from ADT or OnStar, but works with users out in the real world. The controversial part, however, is the company behind the product: Citizen has been making headlines for launching private security fleets outside law enforcement, and recently offered a reward in a manhunt for an innocent person based on unsubstantiated tips.  Square announced its acquisition of the “buy now, pay later” giant AfterPay in a $29 billion deal that values the Australian firm at more than 30% higher than the stock’s last closing price of AUS$96.66. AfterPay has served over 16 million customers and nearly 100,000 merchants globally, to date, and comes at a time when the BNPL space is heating up. Apple has also gotten into the market recently with an Affirm partnership in Canada.  Gaming giant Zynga acquired Chinese game developer StarLark, the team behind the mobile golf game Golf Rival, from Betta Games for $525 million in both cash and stock. Golf Rival is the second-largest mobile golf game behind Playdemic’s Golf Clash, and EA is in the process of buying that studio for $1.4 billion.   U.K.-based Humanity raised an additional $2.5 million for its app that claims to help slow down aging, bringing the total raise to date to $5 million. Backers include Calm’s co-founders, MyFitness Pal’s co-founder and others in the health space. The app works by benchmarking health advice against real-world data, to help users put better health practices into action.  YELA, a Cameo-like app for the Middle East and South Asia, raised $2 million led by U.S. investors that include Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and Sean Rad, general partner of RAD Fund. The app is focusing on signing celebrities in the regions it serves, where smartphone penetration is high and over 6% of the population is under 35.  London-based health and wellness app maker Palta raised a $100 million Series B led by VNV Global. The company’s products include Flo.Health, Simple Fasting, Zing Fitness Coach and others, which reach a combined 2.4 million active, paid subscribers. The funds will be used to create more mobile subscription products.  Emoji database and Wikipedia-like site Emojipedia was acquired by Zedge, the makers of a phone personalization app offering wallpapers, ringtones and more to 35 million MAUs. Deal terms weren’t disclosed. Emojipedia says the deal provides it with more stability and the opportunity for future growth. For Zedge, the deal provides….um, a popular web resource it thinks it can better monetize, we suspect.  Mental health app Revery raised $2 million led by Sequoia Capital India’s Surge program for its app that combines cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia with mobile gaming concepts. The company will focus on other mental health issues in the future.  London-based Nigerian-operating fintech startup Kuda raised a $55 million Series B, valuing its mobile-first challenger bank at $500 million. The inside round was co-led by Valar Ventures and Target Global.  Vietnamese payments provider VNLife raised $250 million in a round led by U.S.-based General Atlantic and Dragoneer Investment Group. PayPal Ventures and others also participated. The round values the business at over $1 billion. Fans of decentralized social media efforts now have a new app. The nonprofit behind the open source decentralized social network Mastodon released an official iPhone app, aimed at making the network more accessible to newcomers. The app allows you to find and follow people and topics; post text, images, GIFs, polls, and videos; and get notified of new replies and reblogs, much like Twitter. Xingtu @_666eveITS SO COOL FRFR do u guys want a tutorial? #fypシ #醒图 #醒图app♬ original sound – Ian Asher TikTok users are teaching each other how to switch over to the Chinese App Store in order to get ahold of the Xingtu app for iOS. (An Android version is also available.) The app offers advanced editing tools that let users edit their face and body, like FaceTune, apply makeup, add filters and more. While image-editing apps can be controversial for how they can impact body acceptance, Xingtu offers a variety of artistic filters which is what’s primarily driving the demand. It’s interesting to see the lengths people will go to just to get a few new filters for their photos — perhaps making a case for Instagram to finally update its Post filters instead of pretending no one cares about their static photos anymore. Facebook still dominating top charts, but not the No. 1 spot:   Not cool, Apple:  Apple promoting these slime apps again. A few of them have $10+ weekly subscriptions.

Even a social network for doctors is struggling with vaccine misinformation,1628,"Even an online medical community cannot completely avoid misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Gizmodo reports that CNBC found a spate of fake anti-vaccine claims on Doximity, an industry networking tool for doctors. While the stories shared come from mainstream news outlets and scientific publications, the comments appear to be full of misinformation about vaccine safety, mask effectiveness, and natural immunity, among other things. The commentators use their real names and have verified medical certificates. Doximity told CNBC there are rules in place that prohibit material that contradicts public health guidelines, including anti-vaccine material. It added that it had a “rigorous” comment review process, with doctors reviewing content. However, the company didn’t explain the spate of anti-vaccine comments or say when it might be able to remove them. The results highlight the problems with content moderation. Many social websites and internet giants have rules banning anti-vax content, but enforcement is a persistent problem due to either a lack of resources or users bypassing the rules. Doximity’s problem is just one more egregious violation – this is a small, closed group full of people about to go through a tougher screening process. It is clear that it will be a while before Doximity and other websites can really help ensure users share accurate information.

Gillmor Gang: Time Delay – TechCrunch,6464,"It is difficult to write our way out of the place where we are. The words come easily enough, each measured by its emotional weight in the stream of problems we face. It is possible that this paragraph will go away when I find my bottom. Mandates, Cuomo, Olympic head gymnastics, where we were two weeks ago and how it is right now. Let’s triangulate: Forget Trump. Forget the Republicans and Progressive Democrats who are working together to slow the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Forget the excuses and half-truths, the topics of conversation, to fill the airtime until the real rubber hits the road. Don’t forget about the brave athletes who dare to fail for the greater safety of their peers. Celebrate the public servants and the tough personal choices that lead us to honesty, empathy, and decisive choices that differentiate between malicious fraud and real-life ballot box results. When politicians refuse to answer questions, draft laws to filter them out of the process itself. When it comes to coverage, debate, and commercial breaks, keep the media by the fire they purport to scrutinize. We had an argument about the time lag between recording a show and posting it here on Techcrunch in a post-produced manner with music added, sneak peeks produced to promote the show, and a post that was kind of related to the context of the show had to do two or so weeks ago. In generating the text, I found that the time delay served a useful purpose in diluting the urgency of the real-time conversation with a healthy dose of context that emerged from what actually happened. The news is always delivered as the first draft of history, but the constant need for reviews creates this underlying pressure to turn stories of insights into controversial clickbaits. This filter, which takes your foot off the gas, turns the black and white into more shades of gray, less dependent on the attitudes of the individual gang members and more on the feeling of the group as a whole. Take the eternal struggle between social media giants and antitrust pressures to regulate the worst aspects of the social storm. One side criticizes attempts to stem the success of these companies in building audiences and unprecedented power in the marketplace – a version of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. The other side says it’s actually broke and needs to be fixed by breaking these new monopolies that arose from user satisfaction with the flow of comments, sarcasm, and family messages. Or maybe the lines of battle are drawn around individual rights against the collective good, as in the fight to control COVID through vaccination regulations. In the middle between these hard-coded partisan attitudes lies perhaps something gentler than law and more powerful compromises. In the case of mandates, the topic comes up in every show. The immediate news may be New York City’s new rules governing vaccinated access to indoor restaurants, gyms, and entertainment venues, but the bigger abstraction is the gap between the federal government’s lack of power to enforce a statewide mandate and the politics of the Governors in the Red States are pushing back all mandates and outrageously forbid local governments to protect their citizens from the effects of the unvaccinated. Two weeks ago, nothing seemed possible to alleviate any aspect of the crisis. Moving to New York today may encourage more people to act now to protect themselves; The data show a doubling of new vaccinations in the hardest hit states. The media, in turn, incorporate this promising data into their stories and push the more partisan memes to the edge of reporting. The net result is a more flexible narrative, in line with the old-fashioned idea that government can actually get some things done, which in turn helps reduce the suspicion that fuels many of the vaccine hesitants. The return to the new normal determines the majority of the mandate discussion. The pandemic’s acceleration of digital transformation seems to reflect a growing understanding that we will not be returning from the pandemic anytime soon. Instead, there is the realization that what we call survival is a premonition of how we will live both at work and at home. We talk about our creative heroes on the show, many of whom have become household names that flooded the public appearances stages and media networks. Streaming has stirred up both Hollywood and the news networks, whose business models and value propositions are being attacked by tech social networks. Facebook says that videos now consume more than 50 percent of the time on its network. Amazon’s advertising revenue is growing rapidly to counter the control of Google and Facebook over the advertising markets. Digital advertising is consuming the linear broadcast upfront marketplace. We often talk about the creator economy, a smug waving of the media red flag in the face of the bull of the mainstream media. The Information, a subscription-driven tech journal, looks like what newsletter startups Substack and Twitter Revue will look like when they grow up. The social audio clubhouse clones offer a similar promise to escape the long tail into viable competition for the Fox, CNN, and MSNBCs of the realigning media companies. At either end of the spectrum, the promise of success collides with the exaggerated reality of too many hours searching for useful differentiation or unrealistic opportunities to escape the noisy underbelly of unprofessional media. If the numbers don’t seem right for the makers, then they don’t seem to be right for the social networks either. Once the feature wars settle, you’ll see a fragmented lineup of star writers on Substack and Facebook, and very little opportunity for influencers and talent to gush out. The introduction of these tools into businesses could prove to be a growth opportunity for enterprise versions. Is that enough to keep the tech in the game? We might know in two weeks. from the Gillmor Gang newsletter __________________ The Gillmor Gang – Frank Radice, Michael Markman, Keith Teare, Denis Pombriant, Brent Leary and Steve Gillmor.

"After trying to back out, Hill-rom will proceed with $375M deal to acquire Seattle’s Bardy Diagnostics",3275,"Dr. Gust Bardy, founder of Bardy Diagnostics. (Bardy photo) Medical technology company Hill-rom has dismissed its attorneys after initially backing off a $ 375 million acquisition of Seattle startup Bardy Diagnostics. The deal to acquire Bardy will now continue, Hill-rom CEO John Groetelaars said in a call to investors on July 30th. Founded in 2013, Bardy sells a lightweight, non-invasive cardiac monitor patch that helps detect arrhythmias. This product made the company an attractive acquisition for Hill-rom – at least in January when the deal was announced. However, shortly after that announcement, Medicare reimbursement rates for Bardy’s device dropped from $ 365 to $ 40 to $ 50 in a large region of the United States, although they have since climbed to over $ 100. Days before the deal was closed, on February 21, Hill-rom attempted to pull out, according to a report from MedTech Dive. But the publicly traded company, which has 10,000 employees, was foiled after months of litigation by a July 9 ruling in a Delaware court. The court ruled that the takeover should continue. Hill-rom said it would appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. But Hill-rom has now decided to proceed with the deal. “We have now come to the conclusion that the best way for our company and for our shareholders is to close the transaction on the previously announced terms,” ​​said Groetelaars in the conference call. “Once we complete the transaction, we will be in a better position to work directly with the CMS and Medicare administrative contractors on reimbursement decisions.” Bardy’s device sits close to the skin of the chest, and the company says it captures clearer, more accurate heart rhythms than competing electrocardiography (EKG) monitors. Founded by Gust Bardy, a clinical professor of medicine and cardiology at the University of Washington, the startup was named Hardware of the Year at the 2019 GeekWire Awards. Bardy sold his previous company, Cameron Health, to Boston Scientific in 2012. Bardy’s ambulatory carnation monitor. (Bardy diagnosis photo) Founded in 1915, Hill-rom originally sold hospital beds and medical equipment, but has expanded into software products and digital health-related services. The acquisition will complement Hill-rom’s existing cardiology products, including cardiac exercise, Holter and resting ECG machines. “Although this did not turn out as originally planned, we believe that there is a compelling strategic rationale for the takeover,” said Groetelaars in the conference call. “Bardy’s differentiated cardiology diagnostic platform is complementary and reinforces Hill-Rom’s existing cardiology portfolio and our vision of connected care.” Hill-rom expects the deal to close on or about August 6, according to an SEC filing is completed. The deal is one of several recent ones in the heart monitoring space. In December, Philips bought BioTelemetry, which remotely monitors and diagnoses heart patients, for $ 2.8 billion, and in January, Boston Scientific bought portable heart maker Preventice for $ 1.2 billion. Hill-rom’s share price is up more than 10% in the last month, although it has fallen slightly in the past few days; The Wall Street Journal reported that Baxter is in early talks about the Hill-rom acquisition."
USA’s Nelly Korda leads after 3 rounds of women’s golf tournament,2920,"There is still a lot of competition as the Olympics go into their final weekend. But a storm, hot weather and rising coronavirus cases loom over the upcoming Tokyo Games final. The rise in Covid-19 continues: Tokyo reported 5,042 cases on Thursday, a new daily record for Japan’s capital. Doctors and public health experts have raised concerns that the Olympics are contributing to the surge in infections, although Japanese leaders disagree. “The flow of people in downtown Tokyo has not increased compared to before the Olympic Games opened. I don’t think the Olympics led to an increase in infections, “Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on Friday. Although the Olympics will end on Sunday, experts will likely not be able to analyze the impact of the Games on Covid-19 cases for at least two weeks due to the incubation period of the virus. Belarus coaches have to leave games: The International Olympic Committee has withdrawn accreditation from two Belarusian coaches who allegedly tried to force sprinter Kristina Timanovskaya to return home against her will. The Olympic body said it had decided to remove the two coaches in order to “protect the welfare of the NOC (National Olympic Committee) athletes who are still in Tokyo as a temporary measure”. Hasan’s search continues: Sifan Hassan from the Netherlands will win her second gold medal in the women’s 1,500 meter final tonight. She has already won the 5,000 meter race and will also compete in the 10,000 meter final tomorrow. No woman has ever won all three races in a single Olympiad Football gold, delayed: Team Canada and Sweden will contest the final of women’s football in Yokohama near Tokyo tonight. The game has been postponed from its initial local 11am start time due to oppressive heat and humidity, which has affected many of the athletes who competed outdoors – and could raise concerns for the men’s and women’s marathons this weekend. The races take place in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, where temperatures are usually cooler than in Tokyo. Despite the early morning start, Saturday temperatures for the women’s marathon are expected to be between 26-28 degrees Celsius (79-82 degrees Fahrenheit). It will be a little cooler on Sunday when the men are running, with a forecast of around 24 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity is expected to be between 70 and 80% on both days, which makes it feel even warmer outside. A tropical depression towards Tokyo could bring a much-needed recovery from the heat, but it also threatens to rain the closing ceremony on Sunday. However, the forecast for the storm is still uncertain. Medal table: China leads with 34 gold medals, followed by the USA with 30 and Japan with 22. The Americans lead the overall medal table with 92. China ranks second at 74 and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) third at 58. What’s on tap: You can find the full Olympic schedule here."

Opinion | Alex Azar: Americans Need to Get a Covid-19 Vaccine,3334,"Some who are reluctant to get vaccinated point out that the vaccines are under emergency approval rather than full approval. It is important for Democratic and Republican leaders to state clearly and repeatedly that the FDA holds these vaccines to such high standards that the only real difference is having full approval steps like analysis of longer-term safety and efficacy data and inspection required by production facilities. Hundreds of millions of doses of these vaccines have been administered to Americans over the past year, giving us some of the most robust evidence of their safety and effectiveness in practice that we have ever had for new vaccines. The vast majority of adverse events with the vaccines occur in the first 42 days or so. The current and past leadership of the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – both parties – are unanimous in encouraging all eligible Americans to take the vaccines. Political, public health, and thought leaders need to educate about the benefits of the vaccine, not educate or preach about the benefits of the vaccine. This information must come from respected and trustworthy figures in the various hesitant communities. We didn’t reach our stretch target of producing 300 million doses by January, but we hedged our bets by investing in a portfolio of vaccines and had tens of millions of doses of vaccine in production by the end of January. Many governors were able to start general vaccination programs by March, and we had a surplus of vaccines by the end of the second quarter. As I think about it, we could have better reminded the media and the public about what could go wrong with vaccine design and manufacture. We should also have explained more clearly the operational complexities that would come with a major expansion of sales. We could have done more to combat hesitant vaccination. In the beginning we focused heavily on the groups that we thought were the most hesitant. We required that all clinical trials include a diverse, representative sample of participants, and the Department of Health and Human Services funded the efforts of the Morehouse School of Medicine, a network of national, state, territorial, tribal, and local organizations to coordinate to achieve trustworthy information for racial and ethnic minorities. But we did not predict the politicization of vaccines, which has drawn so many Republicans to reluctance. According to a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in mid-July, 43 percent of Republicans said they weren’t vaccinated and definitely or probably weren’t vaccinated, up from 10 percent of Democrats. Glad former President Donald Trump was vaccinated, but it would have been even better for him to have done it on national television so his followers could see how much confidence and confidence he has in what is arguably his greatest achievement. The vaccines could be a victory round for the Republican Party, and I urge all party leaders and Conservatives to promote vaccination. Party leaders like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis make it clear that vaccines save lives. Fox News’ Sean Hannity now urges viewers to “take Covid seriously”. Louisiana rep Steve Scalise shared a photo of himself recently vaccinated. I ask for more of this from trustworthy voices on the right."
Delta variant now accounts for more than 93% of Covid-19 cases in the US,3643,"A healthcare worker prepares a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Boston on June 17, 2021. Adam Glanzman / Bloomberg / Getty Images At the current vaccination rate, according to a CNN analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it will take until mid-February for all eligible Americans to receive at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. More than 90 million eligible people in the US are still unvaccinated. And although the seven-day average of people vaccinating each day is the highest since July 4, at 446,300, many experts say the U.S. is still not where it needs to be to handle the pandemic – and the rapidly expanding delta variant – to get. under control. With less than half of the population fully vaccinated, cases have risen again, leading to serious illness. On Tuesday, more than 50,000 hospital beds across the country were occupied by Covid-19 patients for the first time since February, according to new data from the US Department of Health. That number is more than three times what it was a month ago. “We’re not howling a wolf here. This surge that we are currently going through has the potential to be the worst surge we have seen so far, ”said former US surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams during a live online interview with The Washington Posted on Tuesday. The director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday he would like the US to get more than a million vaccinations a day to close the vaccination gap. “We’ll maybe make it when mandates come, but it can’t be 250,000, 500,000 a day, otherwise it will go well into winter. I want to arrive earlier, ”said Fauci. With the spread of the delta variant, it may not be possible to completely stop the spread of the coronavirus, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, on Tuesday. “But we could still get to a place where this becomes a nuisance rather than a threat to your life.” Although experts have said the data so far does not suggest the general population needs booster vaccines, Fauci said efforts are underway to get them for people who are immunocompromised. Some conditions – including autoimmune diseases, transplants, and cancer that are treated with chemotherapy – affect people’s immune systems. “The people we know almost always don’t have an adequate response, so the need to give them an extra boost is much more pressing than the general population,” Fauci said during a virtual event hosted Tuesday by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam was organized. The CDC’s vaccine advisors have met to discuss whether immunocompromised people may need additional protection from a booster dose, but have not yet made a formal recommendation or voted on guidelines. “We are working very hard to put the regulatory mechanism in place very soon to give these individuals a boost that could, if possible, bring their immunity to the level it should be,” said Fauci. During a discussion hosted Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Fauci said it was “very likely” that Covid-19 variants have developed in the bodies of immunocompromised people. People with immunosuppression may not be able to fight off Covid-19 infections for weeks or even months, which means the virus has plenty of time to develop and change. “Variations, as we all know, have arisen because of the pressure the human immune system has put on the virus, most likely from people who are immunocompromised … and who had the virus for days before clearing it and / or dying and then essentially led to the creation of a variant, ”said Fauci."
"Opinion | ‘Freedom,’ Florida and the Delta Variant Disaster",4980,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is not stupid. However, he is ambitious and extremely cynical. So when he says things that sound stupid, it is worth asking why. And his recent statements on Covid-19 help us understand why so many Americans still die from the disease or become seriously ill. The background to this is the looming public health disaster in Florida. We now have highly effective vaccines that are available free of charge to any American 12 or older. There has been a lot of hype about “breakthrough” infections related to the Delta variant, but they remain rare and serious illnesses are even rarer among those vaccinated. There is no good reason why we should still be suffering severely from this pandemic. But Florida is in the grip of a Covid surge worse than it was before the vaccines. More than 10,000 Florida residents are hospitalized, about ten times as many as New York, which has about that population; an average of 58 Florida residents die each day, compared to six in New York. And the Florida hospital system is under extreme stress. There is no secret why this happened. At every stage of the pandemic, DeSantis has acted effectively as an ally of the coronavirus, such as issuing orders preventing companies from requiring proof of vaccination from their customers and schools from requiring masks. In general, he has helped create a state of mind in which vaccine skepticism flourishes and refusal to take precautionary measures is normalized. A technical note: Florida’s vaccination rate is well below the Northeast, but is in line with the national average. But seniors are vaccinated far more often than younger Americans, in Florida as elsewhere; and Florida, of course, has an unusually high number of seniors. For the younger groups, the state lags behind the nation as a whole and even further behind the blue states. Given these dire developments, one would have expected, or at least hoped, that DeSantis would reconsider its position. In fact, he made excuses – it’s all about the air conditioning! He has claimed that any new restrictions would incur unacceptable costs to the economy – although Florida’s recent accomplishment looks terrible when it comes to human life. Above all, he plays the card of the liberal conspiracy theory with donation letters in which he declares that the “radical left” is “coming for your freedom”. So let’s talk about what the law means when it speaks of “freedom”. Since the pandemic began, many conservatives have insisted that measures to limit the death toll – social distancing, wearing a mask, and now vaccination – should be a personal choice. Does this position make sense? Well, driving drunk is also a personal choice. But almost everyone understands that it is a personal choice that puts others at risk; 97 percent of the population consider alcohol-restricted driving to be a serious problem. Why don’t we have the same unanimity in refusing to be vaccinated, a decision that will help perpetuate the pandemic and put others at risk? It is true that many people doubt science; The link between vaccination refusals and Covid deaths is just as real as the link between DUI and road deaths, but less obvious to the naked eye. But why are the people on the right so susceptible to misinformation on the subject and so angry at the efforts to get it right? My answer is that when people on the right speak of “freedom” what they really mean is more like “defense of privilege” – especially the right of certain people (generally white male Christians) to do whatever they want. Not by chance, if you go back to the roots of modern conservatism, you will find people like Barry Goldwater defending corporations’ right to discriminate against black Americans. In the name of freedom, of course. Much, if not all, of the recent “abandon culture” panic revolves around protecting the right of powerful men to abuse women. Etc. Once you understand that the rhetoric of freedom is actually about privilege, things that on the surface look like gross inconsistency and hypocrisy will make sense. For example, why do conservatives insist so strongly on the right of companies to make their own decisions free of regulation – but are quick to discourage customers who refuse to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination from refusing service? Why is local school district autonomy a fundamental principle – unless they want to require masks or teach America’s racial history? It’s all about whose privileges are protected. The reality of what the law understands by freedom also explains, in my opinion, the peculiar anger caused by rules that impose some minor inconveniences in the name of the public interest – like the detergent wars a few years ago. After all, only poor people and minorities should be asked for sacrifices. Anyway, when you see DeSantis invoking “freedom” to avoid responsibility for his Covid disaster, remember, when he says it, that word doesn’t mean what you think it means ."
"How COVID vaccine, face masks pit personal liberty vs. the common good",13666,"LOS ANGELES  — In Anaheim, California, Disneyland worker Judy Hart, 62, says she’ll never get the COVID-19 vaccine because it’s “experimental.”  What about masks? Hart wears one while working retail sales at the most magical place on Earth, but nowhere else. “It’s against our freedoms,” she says. “And I’m not some religious weirdo who thinks it’s the mark of the beast.” After more than 18 months of a pandemic, with 1 of every 545 Americans killed by COVID-19, a substantial chunk of the population continues to assert their own individual liberties over the common good. This great divide – spilling into workplaces, schools, supermarkets and voting booths – has split the nation at a historic juncture when partisan factionalism and social media already are achieving similar ends.  It is a phenomenon that perplexes sociologists, legal scholars, public health experts and philosophers, causing them to wonder:  At what point should individual rights yield to the public interest? If coronavirus kills 1 in 100, will that be enough to change some minds? Or 1 in 10? Today, millions of U.S. residents shun vaccines that have proven highly effective, and resist masks that ward off infection, fiercely opposing government restrictions.   Others clamor for regulation, arguing that those who take no precautions are violating their rights – threatening the freedom to live of everyone they expose. In an online dialogue about the friction between liberty and the greater good, Clare Palmer, a philosophy professor at Texas A&M University, agreed that exercising a freedom to go maskless creates “catastrophic threats to the well-being of others.” “How much should government constrain citizens’ otherwise rightful activities to lower the risk?” she asked. “We may be entering a period… when countries will need to reassess their willingness to use the law to protect the most vulnerable and to advance the common good.” No matter where one stands, it puts a new spin on the famous line delivered at America’s founding by Patrick Henry: “Give me liberty or give me death.”  Seldom in the nation’s past has a culture boundary been so clear-cut, or the clash between personal rights and public welfare been so polarized.  COVID-19 is now killing more than 2,000 Americans each week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with new infections topping 60,000 a day for the first time in more than three months. Nearly two-thirds of the nation’s counties are reeling from substantial or high transmission rates as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.  Against that backdrop, a striking paradox has evolved: About 99% of America’s COVID-19 deaths today are people who did not get shots. Yet, the unvaccinated – who are more susceptible to infection and more likely to spread the disease – also appear to be most resistant to wearing masks. While the scientific research is evolving and medical messaging has been muddled, the vaccine has worked beyond expectations – “a huge celebration of effectiveness,” as Johns Hopkins notes – with limited side effects recorded so far.  That means getting shots saves lives.  It also means vaccines could prevent the mutation of more virulent coronavirus strains while hastening a return to economic and social normalcy. So, why do so many turn down the shots and shun masks? Is it a social syndrome that puts self-interest above the common good? Is it a stand for principle? Is it something else? Michael Sandel, a Harvard professor of government who teaches a course on “ethics in an age of pandemics,” noted in the university’s gazette that mask wearing has emerged as “a new front in the culture wars.”  While covering one’s face is not difficult, mask opponents are driven by another concern: They don’t want government dictating their behavior. Put simply, Sandel said, the resistance is not about public health: “It’s about politics.” “Even as the pandemic highlights our mutual dependence, it is striking how little solidarity and shared sacrifice it has called forth,” he noted. “The pandemic caught us unprepared – logistically and medically, but also morally. … (It) arrived at just the wrong moment – amid toxic politics, incompetent leadership and fraying social bonds.”  “It’s an act of defiance,” said Steven Tipton, a professor of sociology and religion at Emory University. “‘You can’t make me.’ And I will enact my own freedom even if it kills me and others around me who I love.’” Tipton co-wrote the book “The Good Society,” describing how America’s institutions have fallen from grace. He is among many who trace this viral distrust a half-century back to President Ronald Reagan’s quote: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’” As economic inequities mushroomed and social isolation festered, Tipton said, average Americans came to feel betrayed by government, the marketplace and so-called elites. For them, rejecting science and spurning authorities is a statement of moral outrage rather than an act of selfishness. And that sentiment is encouraged in a social media echo chamber that bonds the disconnected.  In the end, however, COVID-19 has no politics or ethical code. The virus, acting on a principle of proliferation, has killed more than 4.2 million people worldwide – especially now those who didn’t get shots.  The moral, Tipton suggested: “Being a good citizen is being mutually responsible. If you believe in the gospels, wear your mask.” During World War II, the Greatest Generation forged unity with common goals. Americans tended victory gardens to overcome food shortages, volunteered for national defense and made personal sacrifices for the good of the country. Today, in the face of a pandemic that already has killed more U.S. citizens than the big war, we block one another’s Facebook pages, stage anti-vax protests and in some cases attack one another for requiring or wearing masks. To be sure, public confusion and discord have been abetted by muddled messages from government and science, compounded by lies and disinformation spewed via social media. The miscues are legend: Early in the pandemic, President Donald Trump declared a premature victory over COVID-19 as his chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, warned against opening the country too soon. Fauci and the CDC have issued guidance in favor of masks, then against them, and then for them again – in part because the virus itself has morphed. President Joe Biden last week applied a carrot-and-stick approach, urging local authorities to pay $100 to unvaccinated people who get the shots while announcing that federal employees will face strict testing requirements if they are not vaccinated. But in the absence of authority or fortitude to impose public health policies, federal leaders have largely deferred to state and local government. The result: a bewildering and inconsistent panoply of policies that vary from one jurisdiction to the next, and may change overnight. “There’s just been such tremendous inconsistency in communications about this,” said Corey Basch, chair of the public health department at William Paterson University in New Jersey.  “I can understand why there are pockets of the population who really don’t want this mandated, and (they) feel distrust.” Consider Los Angeles and Orange counties in California, sibling hotbeds of COVID-19 that form the nation’s largest metro area. In May, after the Orange County Board of Supervisors announced plans to offer a digital record for residents who have been vaccinated, hundreds of enraged people  — leery of a new vaccine — jammed a meeting and denounced what they mistakenly believed was a mandatory COVID-19 passport system.  Jeanine Robbins, 60, of Anaheim, who attended that event, noticed that nearly all the people opposed to vaccination were also maskless. “I think they’re just taking advantage, and they’re putting other people at risk,” Robbins said. “It’s selfishness.”  By contrast, Michael Thomas, a 62-year-old accountant in San Clemente, said he doesn’t believe masks work and he won’t be getting shots because “a person’s immune system will either fight off COVID or it won’t.” Asked whether his decisions endanger others, Thomas shook his head. “It’s a personal right to do what you want,” he said. “A God-given right.” Thomas volunteered that he sees COVID-19 as a “war crime,” adding, “The guy who made it – the people who developed the virus – should be brought to justice.”  Asked who he believes created and spread the disease, Thomas said, “I understand Dr. Fauci was intimately involved …” He would not identify his source for that allegation. According to The Associated Press, a picture circulating on right-wing social media sites, which purportedly shows  Fauci with then-President Barack Obama at the Wuhan, China, lab in 2015, was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., during 2014. In conservative Orange County, plans for digital vaccine recordkeeping were canceled, and there are no generalized mask requirements. But late last month, Disneyland reinstated a mask mandate and announced mandatory coronavirus shots for most employees. Barely one month after Gov. Gavin Newsom ended most COVID-19 restrictions in California, declaring that the state was “turning the page on this pandemic,” viral caseloads in Los Angeles County had increased sevenfold. On July 16, in a push for public safety, the Board of Supervisors reinstated indoor mask  requirements. Sheriff Alex Villanueva promptly announced that his deputies would not enforce the measure because it is “not backed by science.” In the shadow of downtown skyscrapers, Steven Nuñez, 35, mulled the question and allowed that public leaders had no choice but to impose mandates. “We’ve already seen what happens when it’s voluntary,” he noted.  Nuñez, a minister with the International Buddhist Meditation Center, said his theology calls for a balancing of compassion and wisdom, with action based not on personal interests but the welfare of others. “I don’t wear a mask in public because I’m afraid,” he stressed, “but because doing that might keep someone safe.” In the early 1900s, a domestic cook for wealthy families named Mary Mallon unwittingly infected hundreds of people in New York with the Salmonella typhi bacteria before medical investigators identified her as a superspreader. Mallon, nicknamed “Typhoid Mary,” refused to be tested and fled from authorities, only to be captured and quarantined. During two years of confinement, she sued the health department. Upon release, she violated an agreement not to resume cooking and worked at a maternity hospital in Manhattan where more people were infected and died. COVID-19 may be caused by a novel coronavirus, but the legal-ethical issues are not new. And just what constitutes the common good has always been a matter of disagreement. Plato advocated conduct that promotes social harmony. His student, Aristotle, promoted action allowing individuals to fulfill their human purpose. Thus, the debate proceeded.  When the United States was founded, a Bill of Rights got locked into the Constitution to ensure that personal liberties were protected from a coercive government. But those freedoms are not limitless. One person’s right to throw a punch stops at another’s nose. If you scream “Fire!” in a crowded theater, it could be a ticket to jail. “Keep in mind we have seat belt laws,” noted Jessica Berg, law school dean and a professor of bioethics at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. “We have speed limits.” When inoculations for smallpox and polio were first mandated in the past century, backlashes erupted, eventually dying as shots eradicated two of the world’s worst scourges. Yet, Berg noted, some batches of the early polio vaccine had devastating side effects.  The question is not whether government should constrain personal liberties in the public interest, she concluded, but when and how. With face masks and vaccinations, Berg allows that constraints should result in the least possible loss of choices and the most respect for liberty. For example, rather than threats of jail or fines, those who refuse to take precautions might be banned from crowded venues or required to undergo regular testing. The point, Berg said, is to allow for a stand on personal rights by letting people make choices.  “I think if we want to accept the benefits of living in a society,” Berg added, “we also have to accept there are some constraints on individual liberty.” Pamela Hieronymi, a UCLA professor who specializes in moral philosophy, said COVID-19 has revealed the “trickiness of freedoms.” She described various schools of ethical thought, noting that if someone asked four philosophy professors whether vaccines and masks should be mandated, there likely would be four different answers. Then she mentioned a book – “Assholes: A Theory” – by colleague Aaron James, which argues that American culture is producing a swarm of annoying, self-righteous people who behave as if they are so special that normal rules do not apply.   More than a lack of civility, Hieronymi said, “we’ve lost sight of the common good.” Near downtown Los Angeles, social worker Alexandra Sheehy, 37, said she gave birth during the pandemic. As a combat veteran who served in Iraq, she understands that fighting a contagious disease requires a “collective and collaborative effort.” But she also worries about how conflict, anger and stress are wounding society and individuals. “I’ve learned you can’t control everybody,” Sheehy said. “You can only control how you react.”"
"Wildfire-ravaged West now faces thunderstorms, possible flooding",4601,"SAN FRANCISCO – Western states besieged by numerous forest fires could face a new threat this week as thunderstorms loom and the possibility of flash floods increases. The National Weather Service said the storms are expected to hit the western states, particularly the area from the Great Basin to the Rocky Mountains, and could help put out some fires but not bring relief to drought-stricken California. “Heavy rainfall from monsoon activity will continue the potential for flash floods, especially in complex terrain, burn scars and urban areas,” the weather service said in those regions. The first major manifestation of storm danger came on Sunday when mudslides “severely damaged” Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon, Colorado from heavy rainfall, blocking it with piles of boulders and logs, state transportation officials said. Lanes in both directions of the freeway, a major transportation corridor between the Rocky Mountains and the west coast, remained blocked by debris poured from the scars of wildfire in the Grizzly Creek area last year. Areas left sparse vegetation by forest fires across the west are particularly vulnerable to flash floods when hit by heavy rainfall. Parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Washington and Montana are under flood protection. Double-edged sword:Southwest monsoon rains bring relief from drought – but also dangerous floods This was the most active monsoon season since 2015, in contrast to the uneventful season last year. The large influx of rainfall has been a boon to parched states like New Mexico and Arizona – Tucson recorded its wettest July in history with 8.06 inches of rain, nearly four times the norm – but it also had tragic consequences. At least five people died from floods, and several more are missing. AccuWeather chief meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said that unlike last year when the monsoon high pressure area was built in the west and blocked the flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, this year it was farther east over the Rocky Mountains and plains. “The clockwise circulation around the high draws moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California to the southwest,” said Sosnowski. That in turn feeds the downpours, but they haven’t reached Oregon or California, where two of the country’s biggest wildfires are burning, if not as wild as the days before. Firefighters in Oregon reported progress in the fight against the bootleg fire, the largest in the country at more than 646 square miles in the remote southern part of the state. Containment increased from 56% on Saturday to 74% on Sunday. “This reflects several good days of work on site, during which the crews were able to strengthen and build additional security lines,” said spokesman Al Nash. Authorities in Northern California’s Butte and Plumas counties have canceled evacuation orders near another major fire, the Dixie Fire, that charred more than 388 square miles in Bergen, where 42 homes and other buildings were destroyed. The fire was 33% contained on Sunday, but authorities warned that unpredictable winds and extremely dry fuels keep the risk of flare-ups high. Dry conditions and high winds also made dangerous fire conditions in Hawaii, where fast moving wildfire grew to 62.5 square miles on the Big Island, triggering evacuation orders. The outbreak of fires in much of the American West has contaminated the air in much of the country, reaching the east coast and causing air quality warnings in parts of the West and Midwest, including the northern Rockies, on Sunday. Canadian forest fires also led to pollution warnings in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa. Forest fires emit huge amounts of microscopic smoke particles that researchers say are harmful if inhaled and can have both immediate and long-term health effects. Children, the elderly and people with previous illnesses are particularly at risk. On Friday, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with governors from California, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming, the second of its kind, to discuss fire safety and fire fighting measures. “Our resources are already exhausted to keep up,” said Biden. “We need more help” On the same day, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a proclamation to incentivize large companies to conserve energy while the state prepares for potential power outages due to the high heat conditions. Drought has minimized hydropower output and the state could face 3,500 megawatts of shortage on hot days. Contributors: Elinor Aspegren and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"
Unvaccinated Las Vegas man died regretting not getting vaccine: fiancé,6798,"Jessica DuPreez and her nearly three-year-old fiancé Micheal Freedy wanted to give it a year before rolling up their sleeves for a COVID-19 vaccine. But time wasn’t on their side. DuPreez and Freedy dated for over seven years and met while working at the Potawatomi Hotel and Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DuPreez loved how Freedy could “always just light up a room when he walked in”. “His presence has always been so positive and larger than life,” DuPreez told USA TODAY. “It was just great to be with him.” DuPreez and Freedy thought they were careful while waiting to get their shots. DuPreez never considered herself an anti-Vaxxer. She said the novelty of the COVID-19 vaccine and the speed at which it was made made her and Freedy pause. “I believe in vaccines; I believe in this with all my heart, ”said DuPreez. “We just wanted to wait a year to see how everyone reacted.” While DuPreez and Freedy postpone the vaccination, the couple pursues their travel plans. About three weeks ago, DuPreez and Freedy and their five children left their home in Las Vegas, Nevada for a two-day trip to San Diego, California: a small getaway from the desert heat. DuPreez said it was a great time, especially for her children. “None of our kids had ever been to the ocean, so they loved that and got to ride the rides at Belmont Park,” said DuPreez. Freedy returned home with a “brutal” sunburn, purple color with water bubbles, and a range of symptoms: loss of appetite, restlessness, fever, dizziness and nausea. He stayed home from work for the next two days: he couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep and was “hot to touch”. But DuPreez said there was little concern because they attributed these symptoms to Freedy’s sunburn as they thought he was suffering from sun poisoning. DuPreez said Freedy went to the emergency room three days after she returned from San Diego because his symptoms persisted. She said that not much was being made of Freedy’s condition at the time; the doctor who saw him was telling him to drink some Gatorade. Freedy went to work that evening. However, DuPreez said Freedy continued to feel unwell and called in sick over the next two days. Freedy visited another emergency room earlier the following week, where a different conclusion was drawn about his condition – Freedy tested positive for COVID-19. “He panics and says he doesn’t want to die and doesn’t want to leave his babies without a father,” DuPreez said. DuPreez said Freedy’s young age – he had just turned 39 a few days before his COVID-19 diagnosis – and her relatively good health at the time gave her some reassurance that she tried to channel into encouragement. “I promise we’ll get through this,” she told Freedy. Freedy returned home on the advice of doctors to stay hydrated, rest, and self-isolating on Pedialyte. But his condition was rapidly deteriorating. He woke DuPreez around 3 a.m., according to DuPreez’s report of Freedy’s illness on GoFundMe, and told her he couldn’t breathe or stand up straight. DuPreez took Freedy to the emergency room for his third visit in 96 hours. His blood oxygen levels were low and the hospital staff were “surprised that he could walk and speak at all”. Scans from Freedy found pneumonia in both lungs, DuPreez said. It was a rapid decline that DuPreez never saw coming. “[I didn’t] When I dropped him off in the emergency room because he couldn’t breathe, I realized that the last time I would hold his hand while he was awake, “DuPreez said. “That I couldn’t hug him again, that I could never sleep next to him again.” Although DuPreez couldn’t see Freedy after that point, other than taking him to the hospital with clothes and other items, she said she was still hopeful even when a fear set in. DuPreez said Freedy was moved to another hospital and then to a stopover to better meet his care needs. During one of their textual conversations, Freedy expressed regret. “I should have got the damn vaccine,” Freedy wrote, according to a report from FOX5. After five days in the intermediate care unit and a week after his COVID-19 diagnosis, DuPreez said Freedy had been taken to the intensive care unit. She said he was fully intubated and sedated within about two hours of his arrival. DuPreez said she was instructed by a nurse that night to “contact the next of kin and take all of his belongings home”. DuPreez got up early when her fiancé died. She said that she wanted to go to work that day and that she had to leave her children with her sister on the other side of town. But she wanted to visit Freedy in the hospital first. ‘He regrets’:Radio host doubting vaccines hospitalized with COVID, family says “We are not here to assign blame”:WH responds to Ala. Gov. wants to blame the unvaccinated “I want to make sure he knows I’m here,” said DuPreez. When she got to the hospital, she thought there was good news. Freedy was in a new bed and some of his numbers had improved. But soon his blood oxygen levels dropped. DuPreez said a nurse had assured her that this was normal. Then Freedy’s numbers “hit the ground” and he no longer had a recognizable pulse. A “swarm of doctors and nurses” rushed in. DuPreez was promptly moved to the back of the room when the doctors performed chest compressions on him. After 30 minutes of compression, DuPreez said one of the doctors came to her and told her to stop – “we’ve done all we can.” Brant Graves, one of Freedy’s best friends, usually works late and sleeps during the day. That day he woke up from “a million text messages and missed calls”, everyone shared a sad tone: “Oh, this is so sad” and “Oh, I’m so sorry”. Graves first said he couldn’t believe the news of Freedy’s death. “It was just very hard to tell that one of my best friends has just gone and I’ll never see him again,” said Graves. Graves is “fully versed” in dealing with the harrowing realities of COVID-19. He is a registered sleep technologist and spent three months “side by side with frontline nurses who dealt with COVID patients and see them die left and right and see the whole tragedy”. He said he was unaware that Freedy was unvaccinated and that they only talked about COVID-19 in the context of working with pandemic restrictions, such as wearing face masks. “It’s just a shame he didn’t get it [the vaccine]“Said Graves. DuPreez said she and her oldest child were vaccinated on the same day that Freedy tested positive for COVID-19. Looking back on her own experience, DuPreez said that anti-vaccination campaigners should overcome their skepticism and get vaccinated. “Even if you got a sore shoulder or got a little sick, I would take a bit of resentment that he isn’t here at this point,” DuPreez said. “I would just beg anyone to get it [the vaccine] if they can, ”said Graves. “If you’ve thought of getting it – get it.”"
Editors favorite beauty products they can’t live without,13455,"
CNN
—   At Underscored, we try hundreds of beauty products each year, so naturally we’ve found some that are heads above the rest. What are the beauty products we can’t live without, you ask? From hair tools to facial cleansers to nail polish, we’ve rounded up some phenomenal products that we think are worth every penny — enough to buy them again and again. Kiana Murden/CNN Pantene Miracle Rescue Deep Conditioning Hair Mask Treatment My 4B curls desperately crave hydration 24/7. One of the only products that surges my hair with needed moisture when my locs need a bit of TLC is the Pantene Miracle Rescue Deep Conditioning Hair Mask. Not only is it affordable enough to buy over and over, it’s formulated with powerfully conditioning ingredients that leave my hair feeling soft, hydrated and strong. — Kiana Murden, associate lifestyle editor Rachel Lubitz/CNN Esarora Ice Roller I’ve never met a more multi-use beauty product than this ice roller. I use it to de-puff my face and eyes in the morning on the regular, and it even helps with headaches and hangovers (but you didn’t hear that from me). On the hottest of days I’ve literally just taken it out of my freezer and rolled it all over my face, neck and back. For something that looks so utilitarian, your skin and body will seriously thank you. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor Kristin Magaldi/CNN Ilia Beauty Balmy Tint Hydrating Lip Balm I’ve taken on more of a minimalist makeup routine lately, and this is my go-to easy lip color. The color goes on so smoothly and appears vibrant without too much application, but it is buildable if you want a more dramatic effect. It feels incredibly hydrating on my lips, which is a nice departure from the matte lipsticks I used to wear, and the shade Lullaby is just the right shade of berry pink. — Kristin Magaldi, associate editor Kai Burkhardt/CNN Remington MB4700 Smart Beard Trimmer When it’s time to trim my beard, I always go with our pick for the best beard trimmer, the Remington Smart Beard Trimmer. You can save multiple lengths as presets, so trimming your whole face to just the right length is quick and easy. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor Kiana Murden/CNN The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG Under-eye bags and dark circles have been two of my biggest skin care concerns for years now, so much so that I even considered getting filler for them because I couldn’t find a solution that worked for me. At some point, I was introduced to The Ordinary’s Caffeine Solution and I haven’t looked back since. The caffeine helps reduce the appearance of eye contour pigmentation and puffiness, which is basically the perfect remedy for my issues. No eye cream compares to this solution. — Kiana Murden, associate lifestyle editor Stephanie Griffin/CNN Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Original Lipstick Matte lipsticks almost always leave my lips feeling dry and flaky, so I was pleasantly surprised when I tried social media’s beloved Pillow Talk lipstick and it left my lips feeling more hydrated and looking more plump than before. The shade is somewhere between the perfect pink and nude, and is natural enough to wear to work, or it can be built up and paired with the matching lip liner for a night out. — Stephanie Griffin, social media strategist Rachel Lubitz/CNN Ouai Detox Shampoo & Fine Hair Shampoo It took me until I was a whopping 29 years old to figure out what to look for in shampoos. Yes, really. I have extremely fine, curly hair, and about 90% of the shampoos and conditioners I’d use would make my hair intolerably greasy with product buildup. I’d go through purifying shampoos, but then my hair felt stripped. So finally I thought, “Is expensive shampoo really worth it?” And yes, for me it is. I found my cure to my constant greasy, thin hair with this little duo. The Fine Hair Shampoo is what I use every day. It doesn’t weigh my hair down or fill it with product, and I’ve felt like my hair is fuller and I experience less fallout when using it. Then, on days when I feel like I have been a little greasy, I use the Detox shampoo just once to get that buildup out. I can’t even remember the last time I was dealing with greasy, limp hair. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor Sarai Thompson/CNN Tarte Tarteist Double Take Eyeliner After testing eyeliners for our best liquid eyeliners story, I’ve been hooked to one product in particular. The Tarteist Double Take Eyeliner has a hold on me and I’m not ashamed to admit it! Rated as our best liquid liner for a dramatic look, the product’s felt tip liquid pen helps me create the perfect wing and also gives me the option of adding an extra-dramatic enhancement to my waterline with the pencil. — Sarai Thompson, social media coordinator Kai Burkhardt/CNN Image Skincare Ormedic Balancing Facial Cleanser I absolutely love this face wash from Image Skincare because it feels gentle on my skin but still cleans away any dirt and grime. It’s made with aloe vera and flower extracts, and it’s pH balanced, leaving your face feeling clean, smooth and refreshed. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor Kiana Murden/CNN Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Styler During quarantine when all the salons were closed, I was on a mission to learn new styles for my natural hair. For years, one thing that held me back was the dreaded task of blowing out my hair. I’m not the best at manipulating a separate brush and a blow-dryer at the same time, so when I discovered this paddle brush dryer I bought it immediately. It has since completely changed my life. It makes blowing out my natural hair so easy and efficient, especially when I’m trying to do it quickly before getting braids or headed to bed. At Underscored, we rave about the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer ($39.99; amazon.com), but this deserves some love too. — Kiana Murden, associate lifestyle editor Sarai Thompson/CNN Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Longwear Foundation I originally tested this foundation for Underscored’s TikTok to see if the formula really matches my skin tone. I’ve always been skeptical of purchasing foundations online. I find that I get a better match when I shop in-person. However, I took the match test and received a foundation color that matched my skin tone. I get so many compliments! It’s full coverage and my skin looks flawless! — Sarai Thompson, social media coordinator Kristin Magaldi/CNN It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under-Eye Full-Coverage Anti-Aging Concealer I have been using this under-eye concealer for about six years now, and I refuse to give it up. It’s the only concealer that will mask the bags under my eyes without any need for a color corrector first. It’s also long-lasting, and will withstand an entire day’s worth of wear without budging. My only qualm with the formula is that you definitely need a setting powder to go over it or else it appears too shiny. Other than that, it’s perfect. — Kristin Magaldi, associate editor Rachel Lubitz/CNN Sundays Nail Polish If you’re looking for a nail polish that can easily last you a week without chipping or more, look no further than these polishes from Sundays. Available in a slew of lovely shades, they are always my go-to for an at-home mani. I use the clear blue base coat and clear topcoat with other polishes too because there just seems to be something magic inside of these bottles that makes everything chip-free. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor Sarai Thompson/CNN Style Factor Edge Booster Hair Pomade Stick Fuzzy hair and flyaways are the absolute worst. To combat those issues, especially when I wear protective hairstyles for my natural hair, I use the Style Factor Hair Pomade Stick. This product slicks down my hair for long periods (even in humidity) without causing damage. — Sarai Thompson, social media coordinator Versed Skin Versed Day Dissolve Cleansing Balm I can’t speak highly enough of the Versed Day Dissolve Cleansing Balm — in fact, I talk about it as many times as I can. It’s that great. I got this when I knew I wanted to stop using makeup removing wipes, and I haven’t looked back since. The balm literally melts your makeup away and easily rinses off with water and a washcloth. Then, I just wash my face as normal afterward. Now I wake up with fewer breakouts and more peace knowing I adequately took off my makeup before bed. — Kiana Murden, associate lifestyle editor Kristin Magaldi/CNN Wander Beauty On-the-Glow Blush and Illuminator I’ve been buying into the cream/gel blush trend in a big way, and this is by far the best one I’ve tried. Because the stick is dual-sided, I just swipe one line of blush on my cheekbone, flip it around and swipe another line of highlighter on top of that. Though it looks like a lot at first, it blends so seamlessly, adding a nice pink pop to my cheeks with a gentle glow that isn’t blinding. It’s so easy to use and looks great on whatever foundation you use. — Kristin Magaldi, associate editor Stephanie Griffin/CNN Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter I first discovered this multiuse makeup product on TikTok, and I can confirm it’s absolutely worth the hype. I apply it all over my face using the sponge-tipped wand, and the lightweight formula instantly blends into my skin, creating an illuminated, real-life Hollywood filter effect, just as its name implies. For anyone looking to turn their summer glow up a notch, you need this. — Stephanie Griffin, social media strategist Kiana Murden/CNN Malin + Goetz Recovery Treatment Oil The Malin + Goetz Recovery Treatment Oil is meant to be a nourishing facial oil to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Although I love putting it on my face at night, I absolutely love it for my nails. After acrylics or gel manicures, my nails, like many of ours, get so weak and fragile. I randomly put some of this on them as a sort of cuticle oil and woke up to my nails transformed. They were super soft and noticeably stronger with much less breakage. The oil includes argan, jojoba, grapeseed and rosehip oils, which clearly my nails love. — Kiana Murden, associate lifestyle editor Kai Burkhardt/CNN American Crew Fiber Hair Product I use this hair fiber every day to give my hair shape and hold. Its high-hold with low-shine formula works in my thick hair, and you don’t have to use very much, so each tub will last you a long time. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor Rachel Lubitz/CNN Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen As a redhead with a bunch of freckles, I’ve had to take skin protection very seriously. That’s meant going through bottles and bottles of terrible sunscreen that made me break out or look extremely greasy or smell terrible… The list goes on. There is absolutely no beating this formula. It’s completely clear (making it fantastic for a range of skin tones) and melts right into the skin for a matte finish. That’s what makes it such a great layer before makeup too. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor Kristin Magaldi/CNN Pureology Hydrate Shampoo & Hydrate Conditioner When I want to guarantee that my hair will look good, I use this shampoo and conditioner combo. My scalp can get very dry, and my hair is color-treated, which makes it even drier. When you put this in your hair and let it set before rinsing it out, you can actually feel it working. It tingles and cools your scalp, which feels incredibly refreshing and leaves your hair soft and hydrated long after you wash it. — Kristin Magaldi, associate editor Kiana Murden/CNN Clean & Clear Advantage Spot Treatment The Clean & Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment has been my go-to for as long as I can remember — my guess is since I really started breaking out when I was a teenager. The gel is made with 2% salicylic acid and witch hazel to reduce the signs of acne without stripping your skin. Because it’s a spot treatment, I just place a little less than a pea size amount of product on my stubborn zits before bed, and usually when I wake up the pimple is reduced just like magic. I’ve tried plenty of acne-fighting beauty products, and nothing holds me down quite like this. — Kiana Murden, associate lifestyle editor Stephanie Griffin/CNN Ilia Multi-Stick This multi-stick product does it all. It can be applied to your cheeks, lips, eyelids (you name it!) and glides on so seamlessly and smooth, resulting in a healthy, semisheer wash of color. This product is the perfect time and space saver and I couldn’t love it more. — Stephanie Griffin, social media strategist Rachel Lubitz/CNN Merit Brow 1980 I’ve talked about how much I love Merit’s products (namely the Flush Balm) before, and its brow pomade is honestly just as rave-worthy. With the perfect little spoolie brush that gets just the right amount of product on every time, and sleek gold packaging that feels expensive, I get a little thrill every time I reach for the tube. You can build the formula on your brows as well, and I honestly have not experienced a single smudge or messy gloop of product yet. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor Sarai Thompson/CNN Maybelline New York Pore Minimizer Master Primer If you’re a fan of the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, then you’ll love this Maybelline option. As a girl with combination skin, a good primer makes all the difference in your makeup look (especially in the summer). I use this primer before applying foundation or by itself to keep my face from looking fresh and oil-free. This is a major go-to product in my beauty drawer. — Sarai Thompson, social media coordinator"
Strippers Find Community on TikTok,10721,"Teauryajya DuBenion, 29, started her strip career in Los Angeles with the encouragement of a few friends. “In Los Angeles everyone is a stripper. Your local nurse is a stripper, the teacher is a stripper, the babysitter is a stripper, your dog walker is a stripper, ”she said. “I was sick of skipping meals.” Now, over two years later and 400,000 followers later, Ms. DuBenion, whose name is from @PicassoBae, considers herself TikTok’s stripper friend. “You can just run to me in the locker room if you have a rough night and just take a breath,” she said. “I’m like your colleague or work woman.” Ms. DuBenion is part of a growing community of strippers on TikTok who post under the hashtag #Striptok. Instead of gathering around a water cooler, they’ve built an online network to share professional advice, safety tips, and good old-fashioned strip club gossip. Ms. DuBenion recently created a viral TikTok advising dancers on stripping during menstruation. It offers expressive yet practical insights, such as “double panties”. The video had nearly half a million views and the comment section was a choir of women handing out feminine hygiene tips. “The comment area was awash with women offering additional advice on what worked for them, whether or not they were undressing,” Ms. DuBenion said. “It was fantastic.” She believes that many of her female followers who watch her TikTok don’t want to be strippers, but are simply women who are inspired by their charisma and charisma. “I’ve gotten messages from people telling me they have this newfound confidence, whether they’re getting naked, or in their current job, or in the life goals they set for themselves,” she said. “All because of the way I talk about my own stripping life experiences.” Another popular StripTok user is Sky Hopscotch, 27, as she is known on social media, who lightly tossed supplies on a shiny black bag and read a checklist on a chilly night at her Des Moines house not long ago: Lingerie, makeup, baby wipes, perfume and Tylenol. With a bored, dry voice she delivered every line from the off: “Who are we kidding? The men you dance on will also make you sweat. “ She uploaded this tutorial with a caption: “Is your life falling apart? Can’t pay your rent? What to bring on your first night as an exotic dancer. ”The next morning, the video hit two million views and her account grew to 30,000 followers. “That’s when I started posting only StripTok content,” she said. On the podium, she discovered an audience eager to inherit her wisdom as a stripper: the good, the bad, the banality of men’s attention. “I discovered that there was a whole community of strippers on TikTok,” she said. “Many women shared their experiences as strippers: some educated, others glorified the industry. I thought to myself, why don’t I share my experiences? “ In this enclave of the app, women gather to document dispatches from their lives as strippers. They show bruises from twerking, recite locker room melodramas, brag about counting bills, and complain of sexual harassment. StripTok has made it possible for strippers to get their jobs back in many ways, in part because they give each other advice and encouragement in an industry full of disappointment. When she started her career 10 years ago, Sky Hopscotch was what is commonly referred to as the “baby stripper” in the stripper community. Inexperienced strippers are even more susceptible to harassment and exploitation at the whim of bosses and customers. “The strip club clients picked me and asked me to lap dance because they knew I was inexperienced,” she said. “They could be more adept at scamming me out of money or trying to get me out of the club with them.” Many strippers on TikTok use their platforms with the aim of helping younger dancers avoid unsettling experiences. They hope that their advice will be a step in making strip clubs safer and friendlier workplaces for women. “It’s important that seasoned dancers share their secrets, like hiring a bouncer to take you to bachelorette parties so that new girls in the industry don’t have to get hurt,” said Sky Hopscotch. Under the pressure to satisfy male fantasies and competitiveness, strip clubs often become an oppressive environment for strippers. The mental health toll can be considerable. “I’ve struggled deeply with depression, drug and alcohol addiction, eating disorders – all kinds of things,” said Sky Hopscotch. “If I wasn’t pretty, if I wasn’t thin, I couldn’t pay my bills.” When the strip club is dominated by the male gaze, StripTok offers viewers something else: a place where strippers can present themselves freely. Many videos on StripTok show strippers in casual states – without make-up, stretching in changing rooms, idly at home in sweatpants. Others are in oversized t-shirts and advise strippers on how to get hair extensions tax deductible. Katt, 24, a Los Angeles stripper who wanted to be identified by only her first name, found refuge in StripTok after feeling disaffected with her job. She fears that the strip club will “tease out the most poisonous parts of me that the man wants to please”. When she became active in the StripTok community, she began to playfully experiment with her own gender representation. “You see me with short hair, long hair, different wigs. Different looks of makeup. No makeup, ”said Katt. “I have the feeling that people are always there to talk me up and respond to my experiences without making what I look like. That really confirms me. ” Katt is an American of Asian descent and said she was overly familiar with objectification, both on and off the clock. “I’ve seen it in every type of man all my life,” she said. “You see yourself in the media as a hot Asian or a nerdy Asian.” On her online platform, she shares her experiences of being bisexual and Asian in the stripping community, which often resulted in hundreds of positive comments and a network of support for other strippers from different backgrounds. Katt, who sometimes rap to music in their TikToks, hopes that by depicting the everyday life of the strippers, she will help to humanize the profession. “You come to work at 7pm. These girls just eat a Caesar salad, play on their phones and talk to each other about their man’s problems, ”she joked. The interest in the inner workings of strippers on TikTok is not without precedent. “It’s because of me,” said A’Ziah King, known as Zola, in a message on Instagram. “I started an era and created a trail for sex workers to share their experiences and I’m glad the door is now open.” In 2015, Ms. King posted a long thread – 148 tweets – about a dissolute weekend she spent stripping. Her posts were filled with intriguing details about betrayal, attempted murder, sex trafficking, and lost friendships. The story was trending worldwide within hours and was recently made into a film by Janicza Bravo, “Zola”. “I think it’s important that the community share all aspects and experiences of sex work, and only a sex worker can do that,” said Ms. King. “It is important that we share these experiences because it creates a safe space and a sense of community.” Although TikTok is a break from the red tape in strip clubs, like other social media sites, TikTok often censors strippers and sex workers. TikTok’s guidelines state that it “does not allow nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit content”. However, strippers say that informative TikToks about sexual health, safety tips, and general tutorials are also targeted. Ms. DuBenion has completely blocked her account and recently created a second account. StripTok posts often go missing, accounts get banned, and content is removed without explanation. This can affect livelihoods as some strippers depend on TikTok’s Creator Fund as a second source of income during times of financial drought at the club. Sky Hopscotch said her account is often deleted after educational posts about helping sex workers. During this time, their additional income decreases. “I made between $ 40 and $ 60 a day from the Creator Fund, and then I’ve made maybe 96 cents a day for the past three weeks,” she said. “We have to be very careful with what we say and do on TikTok for fear of losing the platform.” Many strippers use their platforms to raise awareness of FOSTA-SESTA, two bills passed in 2018 that are essentially aimed at curbing online sex trafficking. Many sex workers feel left out by the bills. “This has hurt many of us in the community, even though the intended goal was to stop the sex trafficking – statistics say it wasn’t done at all,” Sky Hopscotch said. “It continued to deplate people like me.” By lobbying, StripTok hopes to gain momentum to raise awareness of the harmfulness of anti-sex labor legislation. “One of the legacies of FOSTA-SESTA has made it much more dangerous for people who do sex work to do so in safer and healthier ways,” said Emma Llansó, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit Organization in Washington, DC that advocates for individual rights in technology policy. “There have been a lot of raids on websites where people can share information about health and wellness: all kinds of information sex workers really used to protect themselves, get informed, and help each other.” This censorship has spawned a mutated, hidden language on TikTok for discussing sex work. To conform to TikTok’s guidelines, strippers refer to their job as “bookkeeping” or “scripping” to disguise themselves. “Every time I talk about a stripper, I say ‘skrippa’,” said Ms. DuBenion. “Sometimes when I write it down I use dollar signs and an exclamation point for the I. There are things you have to do to make it work.” Despite the long nights and tight heels, she still loves being a stripper. She saves the money she makes stripping to fund a dorm for people with Down syndrome that her sister has. “I recently received donations from family, friends and even supporters through my social media platform,” said Ms. DuBenion. “I even saved all of the money I made from the TikTok Creator Fund for a down payment on the house. I never thought that stripping two and a half years ago would have such a positive impact on my life and the life around me. “ Ms. DuBenion shared how men walked into her strip club and handed her $ 100 bills because they were moved by their online charities. She hopes this experience will encourage other strippers to share their stories: express their own vulnerabilities and dissatisfactions. “I just want everyone to see that I am a real person and that I have a purpose in this world,” she said. “I’m doing it for a good cause and I’m relatable. I don’t know – I’m not an object. “"
Apple MagSafe Battery Pack review,9402,"
CNN
– The general truth about phones is that the battery life decreases as the design becomes thinner. The iPhone 12 family is no different – including 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max – and on intense days with FaceTimes, a lot of typing and gaming, the battery percentage can drop quickly. So what’s the solution? Traditionally, it’s a portable battery that you plug in or a battery bay that snaps onto your phone. The new solution is the $ 99 MagSafe Battery Pack that attaches to the back and wirelessly charges your iPhone. And we’ve spent several days with the MagSafe Battery Pack and used it across the iPhone 12 family. Let the lightning flash and unbox the latest iPhone accessories. Developed for the iPhone 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max If you want a custom-made battery that doesn’t add a lot of weight and offers a ton of features, we’d say the $ 99 MagSafe battery is for you. For whom is that: The MagSafe Battery Pack is a purpose-built accessory that takes advantage of the design of the iPhone 12 and aims to extend the battery life a little longer. It’s ideal when you don’t want to be bothered with having a separate portable charger. What you need to know: These accessories provide iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max users with an easy and fun way to extend battery life. In addition, it integrates with iOS in ways that other batteries or options cannot. However, it isn’t the most durable or fastest charger out there. How is that in comparison: Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack is neither the thinnest nor the fastest portable charging solution. Traditional battery packs may be larger and a completely separate device, but have more mAh and ports that allow you to charge more devices. Third-party solutions – like Anker or Hyper’s magnetic power banks – are still easy to attach to the back, but don’t offer the software integration and sleek design. They are often larger and produce a little more heat when in use. However, no other portable battery offers deep integration with iOS. The MagSafe Battery Pack is a fixed extender that won’t fully charge an iPhone, but it offers convenience and a few neat tricks for $ 99. We’ve spent the past few days using Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack, and this simple iPhone accessory has a lot going for it. Our tech and electronics editor breaks everything down: https://cnn.it/3eOpdeb Posted by CNN Underscored on Friday 23rd Jul 2021 The focus of the MagSafe battery pack is performance and design, with the latter taking advantage of the unique advantages of Apple’s MagSafe technology. This battery quickly clicks into place on the back of the iPhone 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max. Magnets built into the back of the iPhone match the magnets on the battery pack itself. And it snaps with a satisfactory thump on the back. Like Apple’s Smart Battery Cases, this accessory creates a hump on the back of your phone. The MagSafe Battery Packs are around 11 millimeters thick and weigh 113 grams, which is smaller than the original iPhone and almost the size of a MagSafe wallet. It’s a hard-shell plastic design that’s only available in white with a gray Apple logo on the top center. Previous Smart Battery Cases have opted for a soft silicone case, but this harder plastic seems to be better against denim and falls. It doesn’t scratch that quickly and after some early tests it doesn’t show the color of jeans. The bottom of the MagSafe battery has a Lightning connector and a single LED indicator that lets you know when it’s charging. A Lightning cable is not included, but you will need one to charge the battery. Here’s the best Lightning cable of 2021. When you plug the battery into a Lightning cable to charge, the LED indicator will glow orange and green for a while when it’s fully charged. Let’s imagine that Apple chose the Lightning port because you already have it for the iPhone it will be plugged into. Regardless of your iPhone – 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro, or 12 Pro Max – you now get the same MagSafe battery. It’s a one-size-fits-all approach. For an iPhone 12 Mini, it covers the lower back and fits the edges perfectly. With the 12 or 12 Pro you have a little more leeway left, right and below. With the 12 Pro Max, it sits in the middle on the back with plenty of space. The bigger the iPhone, the more back rooms. Jacob Krol / CNN So there is a small hump on the back that is noticeable but not annoying. The iPhone 12 or 12 Pro can still be held well with the MagSafe Battery Pack and the 12 Mini can simply be placed in the holder. We’re also excited to announce that it still fits in our skinny jeans front pocket. The magnet provides a strong bond that we couldn’t break our phone around or sliding in and out of rooms like jeans. There’s nothing really fancy here, though we can’t help but wonder why Apple didn’t offer these new accessories in other colors. A MagSafe Battery Pack color-coordinated with a purple iPhone 12 or blue 12 Pro would have been nice. @cnn underlined The new @apple #MagSafeBatteryPack is a game changer! Link in bio! #apple #magsafe #portablecharger #appleproduct #commissionearned @jakekrol ♬ Lazy Sunday – Official recording studio The MagSafe battery pack does not compete with traditional portable batteries or quick chargers. It is best thought of as a battery extension. When you’ve got a long day where the iPhone 12 has to go the extra mile, attach the MagSafe battery and you’re ready to charge. Apple doesn’t typically share many specs, and the company didn’t initially specify a battery size for the MagSafe Battery Pack. The back of the battery reveals the cell inside: 1,460mAh (11.3Wh). Both numbers refer to the total capacity, but the Wh is close to that of an iPhone 12 or 12 Pro, so we can imagine that it isn’t a tiny 1,460 mAh cell, but possibly two of them. Apple’s charging rate here is faster than alternatives from Anker ($ 45.99; amazon.com) or Hyper ($ 39.99; hypershop.com), which have larger cells and a cheaper price. And after nearly a week of testing, you can expect the MagSafe battery to deliver around 60% of the power for the iPhone 12 or 12 Pro. This percentage is higher on the iPhone 12 Mini and slightly lower on the 12 Pro Max. It’s a solid extender here, however, and the performance you get depends on what you’re doing on the iPhone while it’s charging. When the MagSafe battery is only connected to the iPhone, it charges wirelessly at a relatively slow 5 watts. This is for both battery health and warmth. And when it’s plugged in, it doesn’t generate a lot of heat either. It is comparable to the heat that a Smart Battery Case delivers. For example, using FaceTime or playing a game puts more strain on the battery and charger, so you won’t see a wild jump in real time, especially at 5 watts. We connected a fully charged MagSafe battery pack to a dead iPhone 12 and after an hour of charging it reached 46% with about 25% battery in the pack. That’s pretty awesome. During a long day at work, we attached the MagSafe Battery Pack before commuting home to make sure we had enough battery life. On a normal night we ended up at around 15-20% and we left at 30-40% while using the device to stream and communicate while commuting home. So, yes, the charge will vary, but it’s an extender if it just attaches to the back. If you’ve wired the MagSafe battery while it’s attached to the back of your iPhone 12, it will charge up to 15 watts. This is a much faster standard that the MagSafe Wireless Charging Puck can produce. It’s also pretty handy as the MagSafe battery has a dual purpose; You can use it to keep iPhone running on the go or have it wirelessly charge on your desk. Jacob Krol / CNN What’s really cool is that the phone charges the pack even after you’ve plugged in your iPhone 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro, or 12 Pro Max with the MagSafe battery attached. It does this by reverse wireless charging, and it’s the first time this feature has been unlocked on the iPhone. It’s similar to how the Pixel 5 or a Samsung Galaxy can charge a pair of earbuds or other Qi-enabled device from the back. This charging feature is a pretty nice bonus. In addition to a simple design and extra battery life, the $ 99 price tag also offers quite a bit of convenience. The MagSafe battery is integrated into iOS like no other battery. Similar to connecting a MagSafe wallet or case, the MagSafe Battery Pack will display a graphic and the battery level of the pack as soon as you connect it. The battery indicator in the upper right corner of iOS will glow green when it is receiving power. Once connected, it will power the iPhone. You need iOS 14.7 to take full advantage of the MagSafe battery pack. As with previous Smart Battery Cases, this is about convenience – not the size of the battery. You can get much larger batteries for less than the $ 99 price of the MagSafe battery, but they don’t snap into the back of your phone right away or integrate with iOS. You can monitor the battery life of the pack directly in a widget and the iPhone can power the MagSafe. If you’re looking for a purpose-built battery that doesn’t add a lot of weight and offers a ton of features, we’d say the $ 99 MagSafe battery will help you cross the finish line at the end of a busy day. However, it is not an endurance charger. If you are looking for a purely larger performance, you should take a look at the magnet packs from Hyper or Anker."
Facebook will require its US office workforce to be vaccinated,1387,"Facebook will require its employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus before they can return to their headquarters in Menlo Park and other offices in the United States. “When our offices reopen, we will require a vaccination from anyone who comes to work at any of our US locations,” said Lori Goler, Facebook vice president for people, on Wednesday. “We continue to work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone’s health and safety.” Much like Google, which announced a similar policy earlier in the day, the company said it will have a process for workers who cannot be vaccinated for medical and “other” reasons. It also says how the requirements are implemented in different areas around the world depends on local conditions and regulations. In June, Facebook announced that it was well on the way to reopening most of its US offices to 50 percent capacity by early September. Earlier this year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said employees could apply for permanent remote jobs. In the same post, he noted that within the next five to ten years, up to half of the company’s workforce could be teleworkers.

"Opinion | What if January 6 Wasn’t a Coup Attempt, General Milley?",5909,"This month, the first series of books on the end of Donald Trump’s administration sparked speculation: Was the President planning to stay in power through some sort of coup? The question arose because Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, in their book, I Alone Can Fix It, report that General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saw the president’s post-election maneuvers in this light. General Milley had no direct evidence of a coup plan. But in the days following Mr. Trump’s electoral defeat, when the president filled senior military and intelligence posts with what the general considered loyal mediocrity, General Milley grew nervous. “You can try,” but they would not succeed with any type of conspiracy, he told his aides, according to the book. “It won’t work without the military,” he continued. “You can’t do that without the CIA and the FBI. We’re the guys with the guns.” While some may welcome such comments with relief, General Milley’s thoughts should stop us. Americans have typically not turned to the military for help regulating their civilian policies. And there is something great about General Milley’s idea of ​​his place in government. He told his aides that on election night a “retired military buddy” called him to say, “You represent the stability of this republic”. In the absence of a coup, General Milley’s comments might be more of a cause for concern than relief. Were we really that close to a coup? The most dramatic and disturbing episode of Mr Trump’s opposition to the election was January 6, and the events of that day are ambiguous. On the one hand, one can hardly imagine a more serious attack on democracy than a forcible entry into a nation’s capital to overturn the election of its chairman. Five people died. Singing protesters called for the execution of Vice President Mike Pence, who had turned down Mr Trump’s request to reject certain votes for Joe Biden. On the flip side, January 6 was something familiar: a political protest that got out of hand. To contest the fairness of an election, rightly or wrongly, is not an absurd reason for a public gathering. For a newly defeated president, it is certainly irresponsible to call an election a “steal”. But for a group of citizens it was only hyperbolic to use the term, perhaps no more than to refer to suboptimal labor and health laws as a “war on women”. The eventual violence did not necessarily discredit the protesters’ cause, nor did the murder of five police officers in a July 2016 anti-police violence rally in Dallas allay their concerns. The stability of the republic never really seemed threatened. As Michael Wolff writes about Mr. Trump in his new book Landslide: The Final Days of the Trump Presidency, “There was no skill – or structure, or chain of command or process or expertise or a person who You have to call – to get things done. ”Mr. Trump ended his presidency with no more authority than he did with his responsibilities. That’s reassuring in a way. The problem is that Trump’s unfocused stolen election theory was distilling and concentrated radical tendencies – first among his associates and later among his supporters nationwide. Rational voices left his inner circle. After Attorney General William Barr told reporters he was unaware of any evidence of widespread election fraud, he was out. Rudolph Giuliani was there, along with a changing line-up of less stable freelancers, including lawyer Sidney Powell, with her theories about selector switches and Venezuelan cunning. Now the President was not only thinking badly; he did the same with poorer information. That was the first distillation. The effect of the president’s theory on disappointed voters was more complicated. Republicans had – and still have – legitimate complaints about the conduct of the last election. Pandemic conditions resulted in a more favorable electoral system for the Democrats. Without the benefit of the Covid-era expanded mail-in voting, the Democrats could have lost more elections at all levels, including the presidential election. Mr. Wolff writes that, from the Republican point of view, the Democrats “were saved by this happy emphasis; that was all she saved. “ It wasn’t all luck either; It was beneficial that the Democrats at certain points manipulated the system to get it. The majority Democratic Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in favor of a lawsuit brought by the Democrats to extend the postal vote beyond election day. Whether the country should now return to pre-Covid voting rules is a legitimate discussion. But Trump’s conspiracy thinking led to another “distillation,” this time among supporters of the perfectly rational thesis that electoral laws had been inappropriately changed to favor the Democrats. (To say that the proposal is rational does not mean that it is undeniably correct.) Those who advocate this idea in a moderate way seem to have constantly disconnected from Mr. Trump. On January 6, the reason for skepticism about the election remained unchanged. But they were being pushed by an angry and very unrepresentative hard core. The result was not a coup. Instead, it was chaos in the name of what had started out as a legitimate political position. Such mixtures of the acceptable and the untenable occur more frequently in democracies than we would like to admit. The question is who do we trust to unravel such ambiguities when they arise? For all Mr. Trump’s admiration for officers, they ended up being particularly reluctant to live up to his disorderly style of government. General Milley wasn’t alone. Think of retired generals like National Security Advisor HR McMaster and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, both of whom broke with Trump at the start of his term in office. We may be grateful for that. But our gratitude should not extend to assigning military leaders any role in judging civilian leaders."
Vaccinated people advised to wear indoors again,12098,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with high transmission as COVID-19 cases continue to rise and vaccination rates wane. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said new data shows the delta variant, which accounts for more than 80% of the new infections in the U.S., behaves “uniquely differently” from its predecessors and could make vaccinated people infectious. “Information on the delta variant from several states and other countries indicates that in rare occasions some vaccinated people infected with the delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others,” Walensky said in announcing the new guidance. “This new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendation.” Walensky emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated, saying so-called breakthrough infections of inoculated people are rare and typically don’t lead to serious illness. She also said the new guidance applies to schools as they gear up to begin the fall term, noting that students should return to in-person learning full-time. “CDC recommends that everyone in K-12 schools wear a mask indoors, including teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status,” Walensky said. Top infectious disease doctors have been calling for such a measure. Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the CDC, which in May said vaccinated Americans no longer needed to mask up in public, has been forced to reassess because of the emergence of the highly infectious delta variant. “The reality is you’re dealing with a much different strain of this virus than we were even earlier in the spring back in May,” Psaki said, adding that the CDC’s task is to “look at evolving information, evolving data and an evolving historic pandemic and provide guidance to the American public.” The delta variant has ripped through unvaccinated communities in the U.S., accounting for almost all recent hospitalizations and deaths. Public health officials have said vaccines largely protect vaccinated individuals from severe disease and death, but breakthrough cases are possible. Also in the news: ►The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, will require employees to provide proof of COVID vaccination when its offices reopen in September, the New York Times reported. ►The U.S. is again reporting more than 50,000 new cases daily on a rolling seven-day average. The country last hit that mark April 30, when cases were falling as vaccines took hold of the pandemic.  ►Two days before Thursday’s start of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago, the city added nine more states to its travel advisory list. Chicago is now advising unvaccinated people traveling from 14 states to get a negative COVID-19 test result no more than 72 hours prior to arrival or to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. ►Tokyo on Tuesday reported its highest number of new COVID-19 cases at 2,848, exceeding the earlier record of 2,520 cases on Jan. 7. Tokyo is under its fourth state of emergency, which is to continue through the Olympics until just before the Paralympics start in late August. ►At least 70% of adults in the European Union have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, keeping the 27-nation bloc on course to reach full vaccination in 70% of adults by the end of summer, the European Commission said Tuesday. Around 57% of adults in the EU are currently fully vaccinated.   Today’s numbers: The U.S. has had more than 34.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 611,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: Nearly 195 million cases and 4.17 million deaths. More than 163.3 million Americans — 49.2% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. What we’re reading: The CDC says masks for the vaccinated are optional.

President Joe Biden said Tuesday his administration is weighing the possibility of requiring all federal workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as infections surge across the nation with the widespread transmission of the delta variant. “That’s under consideration right now,” Biden told reporters. “But if you’re not vaccinated, you’re not nearly as smart as I thought you were.” Also Tuesday, the White House reinstated a policy requiring all its employees to wear masks regardless of their vaccination status. — Michael Collins Mask requirements at stores, the source of complaints and some confrontations — including one involving actor Ricky Schroder — may be back soon. Several of the nation’s largest retailers, among them Costco, Home Depot and Walmart, dropped those requirements after the CDC said in May that fully vaccinated Americans no longer needed to wear masks to protect them and others from COVID in public indoor spaces. Now that the agency has revised its guideline amid the rapid spread of the delta variant, retailers may follow suit. “The main issue with this will be one of compliance,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of consultancy GlobalData Retail. “There was already strong resistance to masks the first time around and this will likely be stronger as re-masking will be seen as a retrograde step.” — Kelly Tyko The California State University system announced Tuesday it would mandate COVID-19 vaccines for students, faculty and staff who come to campus, citing the spread of the delta variant. The university system had already planned to require COVID-19 shots, but the mandate was contingent on the Food and Drug Administration fully approving one of the available vaccines. Now, members of the Cal State community have until Sept. 30 to prove their vaccination status. The California State University system is one of the largest in the country, with 23 campuses and 486,000 students. On July 15, the University of California system — which has 285,000 students — said it would not wait for FDA approval and require the vaccine for the fall term. Most colleges have been encouraging their students to get vaccinated, and about 600 campuses have mandated vaccines, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. — Chris Quintana Congresswoman Julia Letlow of Louisiana, whose state and district barely reach the 40% vaccination rate, is making a passionate appeal for those who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 to get the shots. Letlow, who has two children under age 4, became a widow in late December when her husband, Representative-elect Luke Letlow, died of COVID-19 at age 41 just days before he was supposed to be sworn in to Congress. At the time, he wasn’t eligible for the then-scarce COVID vaccines. Julia Letlow won a special election to replace him in March. “It’s horrific to watch the person who you love the most gasp for breath and suffocate,” said Letlow, R-Start, her voice breaking. “My prayer is that not one more person would have to lose a life.  “The miraculous news is we have a tool scientists have produced to fight back in this war in the form of safe and effective vaccines.” — Greg Hilburn, Lafayette Daily Advertiser A church pastor in Tennessee is taking a decidedly defiant and partisan approach to masks worn to protect against coronavirus transmission. Pastor Greg Locke told members of the Global Vision Bible Church in Mount Julie, Tennessee, that he will kick out those wearing a mask in church. With the delta variant spreading across the country, the CDC announced Tuesday new guidelines encouraging even vaccinated people to wear a mask indoors when in public in high-transmission areas. “If they go through round two and you start showing up (with) all these masks and all this nonsense, I will ask you to leave,” Locke said during a Sunday service. “I will ask you to leave. I am not playing these Democrat games up in this church.” — Gabriela Miranda Missouri’s attorney general has filed suit seeking to halt a mask mandate that took effect Monday in the St. Louis area amid a rise in COVD-19 cases that are burdening a growing number of hospitals around the state. The lawsuit by Attorney General Eric Schmitt argues the mandates are “arbitrary and capricious because they require vaccinated individuals to wear masks, despite the CDC guidance that this is not necessary.” It also questions mandating children to wear masks in school, noting they are less likely to become seriously ill. The lawsuit came before the announcement Tuesday of the CDC’s revised guidelines for masking indoors.  The rise in infections around the U.S. is prompting other communities to require masking, including Los Angeles County and Savannah, Georgia.  The termination of eviction moratoriums in different states and municipalities likely led to hundreds of thousands of additional COVID cases and deaths, according to a study published Monday. The study, published by UCLA researchers, compared COVID cases across 43 states — some of which kept eviction moratoriums and others that did away with them in spring or summer of 2020. States that removed moratoriums saw an average of twice as many COVID cases and five times as many deaths, and ending eviction protections led to 433,000 COVID-19 cases and 10,000 additional deaths by September 2020, the study concluded. The federal eviction moratorium, preventing tenants who are behind on rent from being removed from housing on public health grounds amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, will end this Saturday. Pfizer and Moderna are expanding their vaccine trials for children ages 5 to 11, according to a new report. The New York Times reported that the decision came from the Food and Drug Administration’s push to investigate rare side effects, including heart inflammation, that have come up in vaccinated people below age 30. The FDA asked the two companies to incorporate 3,000 additional children between 5 and 11 into the group, the Times reported. Regulators will have to balance the potential side effects of the vaccines against the risk of COVID-19. Members of a CDC advisory committee believe the protection the vaccine offers for people older than 12 outweighs the risks of side effects. The United States has no plans to lift travel restrictions at this point given the rise of the delta variant, according to the White House. The decision means the country’s current travel restrictions — which deny entry for people from the European Schengen area, United Kingdom and other countries — will remain in place.  “Given where we are today… with the delta variant, we will maintain existing travel restrictions at this point for a few reasons,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a news briefing Monday. “The more transmissible delta variant is spreading both here and around the world. Driven by the delta variant, cases are rising here at home, particularly among those who are unvaccinated, and appear likely to continue in the weeks ahead.” Read more here. — Bailey Schulz Vanderbilt University Medical Center will require employees with leadership roles to receive the coronavirus vaccine. Employees were alerted to the mandate via an employee newsletter on July 15, VUMC spokesman John Howser confirmed in an email to The Tennessean. All VUMC leaders are required to get the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or provide a medical or religious exemption by Aug. 15. They must be fully vaccinated or have an approved exemption by Sept. 15. “The deadline for requiring all VUMC employees to be vaccinated or have an approved exemption is under consideration and will be communicated at a later date,” Howser said.

‘Can I Actually Sing?’ Meet New York City Ballet’s Songbird,7286,"Before the pandemic, Clara Miller had a secret that she kept from her dance world at the New York City Ballet. Well the caretakers knew. After dance performances, she went to empty studios to rehearse. But she didn’t dance. Armed with her voice and a piano, she wrote and sang songs – sometimes, as she remembered, she did not raise her voice above a whisper. Cover songs were also part of her repertoire. Once she used a rehearsal piano on the stage of the David H. Koch Theater and sang “Dancing in the Dark” in front of an empty house. “It felt like I was playing for an audience of ghosts,” she said in a recent Zoom interview. She often made videos of herself performing; she didn’t know how to write down her compositions. But one question remained: “I would listen and say, ‘Does my brain only hear my voice?'” She said. “‘Or am I really bad and just don’t hear it? Can I actually sing? ‘” “It was like my hidden, secret little passion,” she added, “that I didn’t want to share with anyone until I figured it out.” She found out. She can sing. Miller, 25 and a member of City Ballet since 2015, specializes in a mix of indie folk and indie rock, with a voice – pleading, ethereal, elated – that hovers in a space of vulnerability. It feels exposed and tender, but there is also an underlying trust: she knows she is giving out secrets. “Oath”, their debut EP, was released this month. On Friday she will perform at Bitter End. (She has recorded and appears under the nickname Clanklin, but will begin to use her full name.) Her songs don’t ignore the trauma she experienced, especially her difficult relationship with her father growing up – it’s better now – but they also deal with lighter subjects, like an unrequited crush. She calls Phoebe Bridgers her queen – “Women save music,” she said – but she also loves Lucy Dacus, who founded the Boygenius group with Bridgers and Julien Baker, Fiona Apple, Samia and Soccer Mommy. “And I’m always a fan of Stevie Nicks,” Miller said with big and serious blue eyes. “I have her photo on my bathroom wall. She is everything. “ Miller recently released a video of the first track, “Graveyard,” which was filmed by Devin Alberda, a member of the City Ballet, in Green-Wood Cemetery. Miller calls Alberda – who has also explored another type of art as a photographer – her mentor. (Wendy Whelan, the company’s assistant artistic director, republished the video, calling Miller “City Ballet’s own songbird.”) Miller and Alberda became close friends during the pandemic. “She writes these songs for herself,” he said, “and we’re lucky enough to hear her and see her transform through them.” Alberda added that he was impressed with “the empathy, tenderness and emotional maturity she can bring to her approach to life – she has gone through more physical trauma than almost anyone I know. I don’t know anyone who has had their backs opened twice. “ Miller has had two spinal surgeries – vertebral body tethering – to correct idiopathic scoliosis. The second occurred in October 2020; She knew the pandemic would give her ample recovery time. (The cover of their EP shows an x-ray of her spine.) In 2016, tethers were used to straighten her spine. But instead of giving her body enough time to acclimate, she returned to dancing too quickly. The tethers broke, “and my spine got curved again,” she said. “So they went in and fixed the tethers from the first operation and then they put on a whole different set of tethers and I was like, OK, I have to come back slowly.” Her first single “Old Car” released her from her hospital bed, where she had to stay for 10 days. “Songwriting was the only opportunity I had and I really appreciate that,” Miller said. “If I can’t dance, I have to express myself somehow, otherwise I’ll feel sick.” As a musician, she is basically self-taught. As a high school student, she took piano lessons at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, but taught herself to play the guitar – she called her first 18th birthday gift, Stevie – along with the ukulele, banjo and joe the drums. Learning covers served one purpose: it taught them how to perform. (“Oath” shows her take on Bob Dylan’s “One Too Many Mornings”.) “It’s like learning a ballet variation and looking at old tapes of ballet dancers and trying to copy some of their artistic moments,” she said. “I just played the songs I loved on the piano. And occasionally a caretaker would come in and I was just about to buckle up and I got so shy. “ When the pandemic broke out, Miller worked from her loft on the Upper West Side, where guitars hang from a brick wall and drums sit on the side. In the early days, she had a reverse sleep cycle, going to bed at 8:00 a.m. and waking up at 4:00 p.m. It was the first time in her life that she didn’t have a strict schedule. “I started playing the drums at 11pm,” she said, “and my poor neighbor came to my door and said, ‘Please stop.’ So I had to stop. “ What she has really tested in the last year and a half are her limits – both in terms of her dancing and musical self as well as her physical and mental health. Her relationships with several Juilliard alumni – friends who played a role in her musical development – helped. (Along with Steven Robertson, who shares the show with her at Bitter End, some of these friends, the “quarantine crew,” as she calls them, will be performing with her.) After a period of depression, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started taking medication, which made a real difference. “I had so much more access to my artistic voice because I was more stable,” she said. “And then writing just blossomed and when I wrote all of my EPs, that was from January to March.” But Miller, who has regular sessions with her physical therapist and takes classes at City Ballet, has no plans to stop dancing, which she called her deepest love. “To me, dancing means becoming one with the music, just like making music,” she said. “For me, it’s all about the music.” Before the pandemic, she found she danced more freely; she didn’t hold back. “Now I am rediscovering the same lesson with music,” she said. “Even the release of my album was a huge, huge public demonstration that I was nervous about – it’s a very illuminating thing. But at the end of the day my whole thing is, I never want to do anything for fear. Just let it out. “ Busking, mainly in the Times Square subway station and Washington Square Park, was an important teacher. “The first time I played in Times Square, I was sweating all over my body like I was trembling,” Miller said. “I just thought, okay, you have to do this. And the people were so supportive. They took photos and videos and were just so cute. It helped me overcome stage fright. “ As a young dancer, she danced for years – modestly, as she emphasized – for a tiny audience and at competitions on concrete, where, as she laughed, “everything was kind of nonsense”. Similarly, street musicians are about paying their dues. “I like the feeling of being humiliated and getting back to my roots,” she said. “It was definitely a test of my courage and my ability not to mumble. Sometimes I sing so softly. I mean, now I’m bringing a microphone because I just have to or people wouldn’t hear me. Yes, the microphone is necessary. “"
"After Covid Diagnosis, a Conservative Radio Host Sends a New Message",6288,"NASHVILLE – Mark Valentine knows that his brother Phil Valentine, a prominent Conservative radio host who poked fun at the need for a vaccination, had a huge impact on how his listeners view the pandemic and their own reaction to it. “The fact is, a lot of people didn’t get the vaccine because he didn’t,” said Mark Valentine. But after Phil Valentine contracted Covid-19 and was hospitalized in critical condition and made a statement advising others to get the vaccine, the news has divided his fans and critics – who continue to be about arguing the guilt of Mr. Valentine in his own illness and his influence on listeners who, like him, turned down the possibility of vaccination. Phil Valentine, who once wrote that he would not get the vaccine because his chance of dying from the virus was “far less than one percent”, is now being hospitalized, on a ventilator at night and on an oxygen mask during that time connected day so that he can breathe. Last month, Mr. Valentine performed a parody of the Beatles song “Taxman” called “Vaxman” that appeared to mock vaccines. But then, unimpressed, he announced his own diagnosis on July 11, saying he plans to return to his show in a day or two. “Unfortunately for the haters out there, it looks like I’ll make it,” he wrote. But less than two weeks later, his radio station 99.7 WTN announced that he had been hospitalized. According to an update from Sunday afternoon, it is in critical condition. “Phil wants his audience to know that while he has never been an ‘anti-vaxer’ he regrets not being an outspoken ‘vaccine advocate’ and looks forward to being more forceful in taking that position once he does it’s “back on the air that we all hope will be soon,” said the broadcaster. Since the news of his diagnosis broke out, his family and website have received hundreds of messages on social media from fans sharing their support, as well as critics, some of whom said he deserved to get sick. The response is a microcosm of the ongoing debate over the division among Americans as vaccination rates decline. Currently, 56.5 percent of people in the United States have received at least one dose and 48.9 percent are fully vaccinated, according to the New York Times database. Joe Bonsall, a longtime friend of Mr. Valentine’s, said he spent Sunday morning blocking hateful commentators on Twitter after his band, the Oak Ridge Boys, expressed their support on Twitter using the hashtag #PrayforPhil . “There are people who say Phil deserves this,” said Mr. Bonsall. “But nobody deserves that.” Mr Bonsall, who is conservative, is frustrated that the vaccine has become a “political issue” for many people rather than a public health concern. He said he got the vaccine as soon as he could get his hands on it because his band was on tour. But his wife, along with other family members, refuses to get vaccinated until they get full approval (the vaccines now have emergency approval) from the Food and Drug Administration. “It’s going to harm people,” Bonsall said of people’s refusal to get vaccinated. “It hurt Phil too.” But others say that it is not enough for Mr. Valentine, who also gained a following as a climate change denier, to advise listeners to do the recording now. Updated July 26, 2021, 2:04 p.m. ET “This is a person in a position of authority,” commented Phil Stokes on Mark Valentine’s social media posts updating his brother’s status, who lives in Hamburg, NY. “On the one hand, he has the authority to make decisions about his own health – but he has also put himself and his audience at risk.” Mr. Stokes said he appreciated Mr. Valentine’s family’s comments on his move to encourage everyone to get vaccinated. “Hopefully we don’t need more high-profile people to get this sick,” said Stokes. Interest in Mr. Valentine comes as the number of cases has quadrupled in the last month and concerns about vaccination rates and mask wear have re-emerged. Hospital stays and death rates have also increased, along with the advent of the delta variant, which is more contagious and can lead to more severe cases. On CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City, Missouri, expressed fears among officials about the spread of the virus and many people’s refusal to be vaccinated on Sunday. “We must continue to defend ourselves against negative messages,” he said. Mr. Valentine’s situation became a focus for many people. But that didn’t mean that even devoted listeners would follow his advice. “This is Phil Valentine’s ordeal – this is his cross, so to speak,” said a man who took just his first name Daniel and said he lived in Lascassas, Tennessee, 40 miles south of Nashville. “And that the family came out – ‘Just go get the tape,’ he said – well, no, I mean, I’m not that easy to be influenced by a radio talk show host.” He said he still didn’t see the need to get vaccinated. “I know Covid is real; I know people die from things like that, ”he said. “But I just know that in my current situation I didn’t have the urge to either travel where they need it or just go willingly and get it.” Mr. Valentine is one of 514 Covid-19 patients currently hospitalized in Tennessee, up 78 percent in the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. In Davidson County, where Nashville is located, 48 percent of residents are fully vaccinated. Although the vaccinated population in Nashville is higher than the rest of the state, it is still not good enough, according to Alex Jahangir, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and head of the Covid-19 Task Force in Nashville. He hoped that Mr Valentine’s reported support for the vaccine could have an impact on others. “The people I want to include have probably already been drafted,” said Dr. Jahangir. “The people we want are the ones who listen to people like Mr. Valentine.” According to Mark Valentine, his brother’s diagnosis has already had an effect: almost a dozen people in the audience turned to him and said they had the vaccine, he said. He said he also got himself vaccinated the day his brother was hospitalized. “The Lord works in a mysterious way,” said Mark Valentine. “Maybe this happened so that Phil could talk to people and make sure that more people don’t die.” Melina Delkic contributed to the reporting"
"CDC reconsiders mask guidance; mixing AstraZeneca, Pfizer shots study",7155,"Dr. Anthony Fauci says the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering revising their COVID-19 guidelines to recommend that even fully vaccinated individuals wear masks in public. Fauci, the nation’s senior government infectious disease official, told CNN’s State of the Union that he had participated in talks about changing the policy, which he described as “in active consideration.” In the past two weeks, COVID-19 cases across the country have increased 171%, powered by the Delta variant. The death rate has increased by 19% compared to the previous week. Eleven weeks ago, when more than 1 million Americans were being vaccinated a day and the number of COVID-19 cases was low, the CDC announced that most fully vaccinated people would no longer have to wear masks, even in crowded rooms. “There is more damage control to come. Whether it is about masking or closure, or whether your children need to get back to virtual learning, this is coming, ”said Dr. Jerome Adams, former US surgeon general, told CBS “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “And it’s coming because this pandemic is spiraling out of control again. And it’s getting out of hand because we don’t get enough people vaccinated. “ Los Angeles County and other communities require everyone to wear masks indoors. St. Louis announced that starting Monday, everyone aged 5 and over will be required to wear masks indoors, vaccinated or unvaccinated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal masking in schools. Around 1.5 million doses were given that weekend, according to the CDC. Sunday’s total of 779,000 represented an increase of 29% of Americans re-vaccinated from the previous week from a 7-day average, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, White House COVID-19 Director. But with 49.1% of the nation fully vaccinated, the US is far from herd immunity, compounded by the rapid spread of the Delta variant, which now accounts for 83% of cases nationwide. Also on the news: ►According to the Michigan Department and Human Services, at least 17 cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the past month from attendees at the Faster Horses Festival. Some of these people were at the festival while contagious. ►Multiple states, including Florida, Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota, scaled back their coverage of COVID-19 statistics this month as cases skyrocketed across the country and provided the public with real-time information on outbreaks, cases, hospital admissions, and deaths in their communities. ►The Chief of Staff of Chancellor Angela Merkel warned at the weekend that restrictions for unvaccinated people may be necessary if the COVID-19 infection numbers reach new heights in the coming months. The Tokyo Olympics organizers on Sunday announced 10 new positive tests in people associated with the Games, bringing the total to at least 137, including 16 athletes, the New York Times reported.  Today’s numbers: There have been more than 34.4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 610,800 deaths in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. The global totals: More than 194 million cases and 4.15 million deaths. More than 163 million Americans – 49.1% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. What we read: Florida leads the nation in new cases, recording more this week than California, Texas, New York and Illinois combined. And as elsewhere, the unvaccinated make up almost all hospital stays and deaths. But local residents, including many health care workers, are still suspicious of the shot. Continue reading.

A South Korean study found evidence of increased antibody levels when people received a mixed schedule of an AstraZeneca vaccine and then the Pfizer vaccine, Reuters reported. The study follows a study from the UK with similar results when mixing AstraZeneca and Pfizer instead of two cans of AstraZeneca. The FDA has not yet approved the AstraZeneca vaccine in the United States Public health officials have asked if a “mix and match” vaccine schedule would be safe and effective. It was also asked whether a booster dose is needed for those who received two syringes of Moderna or Pfizer or one syringe of Johnson & Johnson in the US as coronavirus variants spread. However, Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization, described the blended approach as a “dangerous trend” earlier this month, adding that it could lead to people choosing for themselves which vaccines to combine and how many doses to receive. Canada and Thailand have allowed some form of mixing and matching under certain circumstances, but as yet no such combination of vaccines has been authorized in the US Humans aren’t the only ones to contract COVID-19 during the surge. An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo contracted the coronavirus, according to a statement from the zoo. The 9-year-old snow leopard named Ramil tested positive for the virus Friday after a wildlife care specialist noticed he had a cough and nasal discharge, the statement said. According to the statement, the snow leopard seems to be doing well with no further symptoms. Ramil shared the same habitat as a female snow leopard and two Amur leopards, which may also have been exposed. They are believed to have been exposed and are currently in quarantine as veterinarians monitor their symptoms. In January, three gorillas tested positive for COVID at the San Diego Zoo, the first known case in monkeys. The San Diego Zoo announced on July 6th that animals at the zoo and safari park would be receiving COVID-19 vaccines for some of their animals, including wild cats and martens. The doses from Zoetis, a New Jersey-based veterinary drug company, require two vaccines three weeks apart, similar to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. It is not known how Zamil got infected. – Steven Vargas A conservative talk radio host from Tennessee changed his previously skeptical messages about vaccines after being hospitalized with COVID-19, his family said. Phil Valentine, who posted on social media to prevent his audience from getting vaccinated unless they “threaten to die” from COVID, has been hospitalized in intensive care and is given oxygen but is not on one Ventilator. according to his brother. Valentine told audience members after he was diagnosed – but before he was hospitalized – that he made a decision not to get a COVID vaccine because he thought he probably wouldn’t die from the disease. His brother Mark Valentine said on WWTN-FM in Nashville this week that his brother was never an “opponent against Vaxx” but was “pro-information” and “pro-choice” about the vaccine. “Firstly, he regrets that he has not been more involved in vaccination,” said Mark Valentine. “For those of you listening, I know if he could tell you this he would tell you, ‘Go get vaccinated. Stop worrying about politics. Stop worrying about all the conspiracy theories. ‘” – Jeanine Santucci Contributors: Karen Weintraub, USA TODAY; The Associated Press."
Wildfires scorch Western US as homes burn and thousands threatened,3116,"Thousands of firefighters across the country battled “extreme fire behavior” on Sunday when California’s largest fire tore down homes and forced thousands of residents to flee the rapidly spreading flames. The Dixie Fire in Northern California was one of at least 88 major forest fires that raged in 13 states, including one in Oregon that burned 640 square miles. More than 22,000 firefighters fought the flames, often battling rough terrain in hot, dry conditions, the National Interagency Fire Center said. “Northern Intermountain West will continue to experience very dry conditions, including poor overnight recovery for medium slopes and ridges,” the fire department warned. The Dixie Fire, which began less than two weeks ago, had grown to about 300 square miles on Sunday and destroyed more than 20 homes and buildings. Thousands of homes were threatened and more than 5,000 firefighters fought the fire, Cal Fire said. “Grateful for our firefighters fighting the Dixie Fire,” tweeted California Governor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency. “If you are in the area please stay safe and obey local official warnings.” From clouds of fire to fire tornadoes So forest fires can create their own weather Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea was among the police officers who went door-to-door to ensure residents of the areas at risk were evacuated. Compounding the extinguishing work was a number of smaller fires that broke out in the area, including some from people using machines, Honea said. “We can’t afford any more fires, and luckily Cal Fire managed to get these fires under control and keep them from destroying structures or from spreading,” Honea told the Enterprise Record. “But happiness won’t last. So if you’re out there doing things … that could start a fire – stop. “ Evacuations have been ordered for several communities in the counties of Butte, Plumas and Tehama. The cause of the fire has not been clarified. Elsewhere in California, the fire in Tamarack, south of Lake Tahoe, continued to burn through wood and chaparral and threatened communities on both sides of the California-Nevada state line. The fire that started by lightning in Alpine County on July 4 destroyed at least 10 buildings. Heavy smoke from this fire and the Dixie fire reduced visibility and can sometimes land planes assisting the firefighters. Air quality south of Lake Tahoe and across the state line into Nevada deteriorated to very unhealthy levels. The country’s largest wildfire, the southern Oregon bootleg fire, was nearly half encircled on Saturday as more than 2,200 crew members worked to contain it in the heat and wind, firefighters said. The growth of the widespread fire had slowed, but thousands of homes remained threatened on its east side, authorities said. “This fire is resistant to being caught on bulldozers,” said Jim Hanson, behavioral fire analyst with the Oregon Department of Forestry. “Given the critically dry weather and the fuels we are experiencing, firefighters must constantly reassess their control lines and look for emergency options.” Contribution: The Associated Press"
Why Some Americans Are Still Hesitant to Get Vaccinated,9757,"CHICAGO – They admitted they could have shown up months ago. Many were content to finally do the right thing. A few growled that they had no other choice. In a single day last week, more than half a million people in the United States flocked to high schools, pharmacies, and buses being converted into mobile clinics. Then they rolled up their sleeves and got their coronavirus vaccines. These are the Americans who are being vaccinated at this moment of the pandemic: the reluctant, the fearful, the hesitant. In dozens of interviews Thursday in eight states, at vaccination clinics, drug stores, and pop-up mobile sites, Americans who finally got their vaccinations offered a snapshot of a nation at a crossroads – facing a new surge in the virus but just slowly embrace the vaccines that might stop it. The people who are being vaccinated now are not among the eager crowds that rushed to early appointments. But even they are not decidedly against vaccinations in the group. Instead, they occupy a middle ground: they have been unwilling to get a coronavirus vaccine for months until something or someone – a stubborn family member, a job requirement, a growing sense of vaccination security – convinced them otherwise. How many people ultimately join this group and how quickly could determine the course of the coronavirus in the United States. Some of the newly vaccinated said they made the decision abruptly, even casually, after months of inactivity. A woman in Portland, Oregon waited for an inducement before getting her syringe, and when she heard a pop-up clinic at a farmers market were giving out $ 150 gift certificates, she decided it was time . A 60-year-old man in Los Angeles came over spontaneously to be vaccinated when he noticed that, for once, there was no line in a clinic. One construction worker said his work schedule made it difficult to get the shot. Many people said they arrived after strong pressure from family or friends for a vaccine. “‘You’re going to die. Get the Covid vaccine,” Grace Carper, 15, recently told her mother, Nikki White of Urbandale, Iowa, as they discussed when they would get their vaccinations. Ms. White, 38, woke up on Thursday up and said she would. “If you want to get your vaccine, get up,” Ms. White said to her daughter, who was looking forward to the vaccination, and the couple went to a Hy-Vee supermarket together. Others were moved by practical considerations: plans to attend college that requires vaccination, a desire to hang out with high school classmates, or a job that would require unvaccinated staff to wear masks. Their responses suggest that mandates or increased restrictions on the unvaccinated, increasingly debated by employers and government officials, could make a significant difference. Audrey Sliker, 18, of Southington, Connecticut, said she was given a chance because the New York governor announced that all students in the State University of New York schools would require it. She plans to be a newbie at SUNY Cobleskill this fall. “I just don’t like needles in general,” she said, walking out of a white tent that housed a mobile vaccination center in Middlefield, Conn. “So it’s more like, ‘Do I have to get them?'” Many of the respondents described their decisions in personal, somewhat complicated terms. Willie Pullen, 71, was nibbling on a bag of popcorn as he was leaving a vaccination center in Chicago, one of the few people to show up that day. He wasn’t exactly against the vaccines. Almost everyone in his life was already vaccinated, he said, and although he was at greater risk because of his age, he believed he was healthy and strong enough to think about it for a while. What drove him to a high school on the West Side of Chicago where free vaccines were being given was the illness of an aging friend’s mother. Mr. Pullen wanted to visit her. He felt it was irresponsible to do this without vaccination. “I persevered,” said Mr. Pullen. “I had reservations about the safety of the vaccine and the government that is doing it. I just wanted to wait and see. “ The campaign to vaccinate Americans widespread against the coronavirus began earlier this year in a roaring, high-energy surge as millions were vaccinated every day and coveted vaccination dates were celebrated with happy selfies on social media. Efforts peaked on April 13 when an average of 3.38 million doses were administered in the United States. The Biden government aims to have 70 percent of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4th. Updated July 24, 2021 at 11:34 a.m. ET But the vaccinations have been falling steadily since mid-April and have remained on a plateau in the last few weeks. Weeks after the July 4th benchmark passed, the effort has now dwindled, distributing an average of about 537,000 doses per day – a decrease of about 84 percent from the high. About 68.7 percent of American adults have received at least one injection. Conservative commentators and politicians have questioned the safety of the three vaccines the Food and Drug Administration has approved for emergency use, and in some parts of the country opposition to vaccination is politically linked. An analysis of the New York Times vaccine and electoral rolls in each county in the United States found both willingness to receive a coronavirus vaccine and actual vaccination rates in counties where a majority of residents voted for readmission has, on average, were lower. elects Donald J. Trump. Despite the delayed vaccination efforts, there are indications that alarming headlines about a new surge in coronavirus cases and the highly contagious Delta variant could lead more Americans to consider vaccination. On Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there had been “encouraging data” showing that the five states with the highest case numbers – Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri and Nevada – also had higher vaccination rates. In Florida, a Sarasota County clinic was quiet, a brightly lit waiting area full of mostly empty chairs. Several people came in, often no more than an hour or two in an hour. Lately they are vaccinating fewer than 30 people a day there. Paralegal Elysia Emanuele, 42, came in for a shot. One factor in her decision was the rising number of cases in the state, which she watched with concern. “If everything went smoothly, if we’d shut down immediately and did what we had to do and it seemed to have been wiped out,” she said, “I think I probably would have gotten the vaccine less.” Some people said they heard snippets they feared being taped on social media or cable TV – misinformation about vaccines is rife – but they said they ultimately rejected the rumors. In the shadow of a freeway underpass in South Los Angeles, volunteers and potential vaccinees attempted to chat over the roar of cars driving by. Ronald Gilbert, 60, said he doesn’t really believe in the vaccines and has never been a fan of needles, but with an increase in cases he argued that “it is better to play it safe”. “I feel better now if I do this seriously,” he said. “I’m going to run like a rooster, chest up, like, ‘Do you have the vaccine? I got the vaccine. ‘” News of the Delta variant also changed the mind of Josue Lopez, 33, who hadn’t planned on getting a vaccine after his entire family tested positive for the coronavirus in December. “I thought I was immune, but if this variant is more dangerous, it might not be enough,” he said. “Even now, I’m not sure it’s safe.” At a vaccination site at Malcolm X College in Chicago, Sabina Richter, one of the workers there, said it used to be easy to find people to get injected. More recently, they had to offer incentives: passes to an amusement park in the northern suburbs and Lollapalooza. “Some people come in and still hesitate,” she said. “We have to fight for each of them.” Cherie Lockhart, an employee at a Milwaukee care facility for the elderly and disabled, said she was concerned about the vaccines because she didn’t trust a medical system she believed had always treated blacks differently. She was not a vaccine opponent, she said, but just hesitated until she could be reassured. Her mother finally won her over. “My mom has never steered me wrong,” said Ms. Lockhart, 35. “She said, ‘I feel like this is right in my heart.’ So I prayed about it. And in the end I went with my guide light. “ Many of the people who checked for vaccinations said they wanted to see how the vaccines affected the Americans who were rushing to get them early. “I know people who got it and they didn’t get sick, that’s why,” said Lisa Thomas, 45, a home nurse from Portland, Ore. “I haven’t heard of any case that anyone has been injured.” of it, and there is a lot to benefit from. “ For Cindy Adams, who works for a Des Moines insurance company, her job requirement, as an unvaccinated person, was wearing a mask that forced her to go to the Polk County Health Department’s driving clinic for her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Ms. Adams, 52, said she was concerned about possible long-term effects of the vaccines. But now her husband, children, and most of her extended family have been vaccinated, as have most of their staff. “I’m just sick of wearing the mask,” said Ms. Adams. “We had an event yesterday and I had to wear it for five hours because I was with a lot of people. And I was sick of it. “Everyone else is healthy and hasn’t had any serious side effects, so I decided to join the crowd.” Julie Bosman reported from Chicago. The coverage included Matt Craig from Los Angeles, Elizabeth Djinis from Sarasota, Florida, Timmy Facciola from Middlefield, Connecticut, Ann Hinga Klein from Des Moines, Emily Shetler from Portland, Oregon, and Dan Simmons from Milwaukee."

However, Bitcoin and Ether remain depressed for a period of seven days. And the stock market is up today. What more could you want on a Wednesday? How about a huge series of startup and tech news? We can do this! – Alex Today we have a lot to tell from the world of startups thanks to the charged venture capital cadence around the world. Above, if you’re keeping an eye on Robinhood’s initial public offering, here are our latest notes. Now let’s talk about tech upstarts and private capital, starting with some fintech updates. To conclude our startup reporting, a few final remarks. Pangea raised $ 68 million for its men’s personal care brands. That’s cool. But don’t confuse it with Pangea of ​​Providence, Rhode Island, a recent Y Combinator graduate who has some news. More on that soon. If you want to dig deeper into the latest trending business books, the Equity team recently sat down with one of the writers on The Cult of We to talk about everything related to WeWork. For early stage startups, there is a temptation to claim that the go-to-market strategy is fully functional. In reality, GTM is a pure numbers game, and even with a solid plan, it can easily be thwarted by common problems like turf wars and poor communication. Finding GTM fit is a milestone for any startup that can encompass anything from expanding the engineering team to starting your first media purchase. But how do you know when you reached that magical moment? “There are three metrics to consider: gross churn, magic number, and gross margin,” said Tae Hea Nahm, co-founder and chief executive officer of Storm Ventures. High churn means that customers are not enthusiastic, low gross margins mean poor unit economy and this so-called magic number? “You can calculate it by dividing the new ARI by your marketing and sales expenses,” said Nahm. “But remember that the magic number is a lagging indicator and it can take a few quarters before you see a positive result.” (Extra Crunch is our membership program that helps founders and startup teams move forward.

J&J may not be as effective against delta variant: COVID updates,8198,"Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine may not be as effective as those using mRNA technology, according to a new study Tuesday. The study published by bioRxiv says the 13 million people who received the vaccine may need a second dose, ideally the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Although the study was not peer-reviewed or published, the results are consistent with studies of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which conclude that a dose of the vaccine was 33% against symptomatic disorders of the Delta variant and 60% against the variant after the second dose is effective. “The message we wanted to get across wasn’t that people were making the J. & J. Vaccine, but we hope it will either go with another dose of J. & J. or a boost with Pfizer or Moderna, ”Nathaniel Landau, virologist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine who led the study, told the New York Times. The results contradict the studies published by Johnson & Johnson that say a single dose of their vaccine is effective against the variant. The delta variant continues to spread in the US and accounts for about 83% of cases in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not all vaccines are 100% effective, as the increase in cases in vaccinated people shows, but they have been shown to save people from serious illness. Also on the news: ► The head of the World Health Organization says the Tokyo Olympics should not be judged by how many COVID-19 cases there are because it is impossible to eliminate risks. ►Las Vegas employees are now required to wear masks indoors, but the mandate won’t extend to tourists walking the Strip or congregating in crowded casinos, Clark County commissioners decided. The new mandate will remain in force until at least August 17th. ►Apple is reportedly postponing its return to office by at least a month until October due to the spread of the Delta variant, Bloomberg reported. CEO Tim Cook previously said employees would be returning to the office three days a week in September. ►A White House official and a staff member from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, tested positive for the coronavirus after attending an event together, a White House official confirmed. Both were fully vaccinated. ► Amazon will no longer test its warehouse workers at the end of the month due to vaccine availability and free testing, The Information reported. The initiative started last year when tests were difficult to secure, and reported that around 1.4% of their workers tested positive at some point in 2020. Today’s numbers: There have been more than 34.1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 609,000 deaths in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The global totals: more than 191 million cases and 4.1 million deaths. According to the CDC, more than 161.4 million Americans – 48.6% of the population – have been fully vaccinated. What we read: At a time when the infection rate has doubled, many remain unvaccinated, and the Delta variant is much more contagious than the original, it is important to realize that vaccines are not working properly.

Americans who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 can apply for up to $ 9,000 in funeral aid, but some find the money hard to come by. More than $ 710 million has been distributed to 107,000 people so far. However, some applicants said they could provide FEMA with evidence that their relative had died of COVID if another cause of death, such as underlying conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, was listed on the death certificate – especially in the early days of the pandemic when testing was limited. FEMA says it is streamlining paperwork, but Kalpana Kpoto says she submitted paperwork to the FEMA website three times after her mother died last year. Her documents were eventually approved, but she didn’t see any money. “I’m still waiting,” said Kpoto, “It’s a process.” The United States saw the largest one-year decline in life expectancy since World War II during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Hispanic and black populations saw the largest decline, according to government data released Wednesday. Life expectancy at birth fell 1.5 years to 77.3 years in 2020 – the lowest level since 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. Between 1942 and 1943, during World War II, life expectancy in the United States decreased by 2.9 years. “The numbers are devastating,” said Chantel Martin, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health at Chapel Hill. “The declines that we are seeing, particularly in the Hispanic and non-Hispanic black populations, are massive.” Health experts said the life expectancy data is further evidence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on color communities. According to the data, COVID-19 deaths contributed approximately 74% of the decline in life expectancy in the general US population. Another 11% of the decrease can be attributed to the increase in deaths from accidental or accidental injuries, including deaths from drug overdose.

Boston Children’s Hospital researchers estimate that, according to their model, published Tuesday in The Lancet, more than a million children could have been orphaned from deaths related to COVID-19. They defined orphans as the loss of at least one parent. Countries with the highest numbers of children who have lost primary caregivers include the United States, South Africa, Peru, India, Brazil, and Mexico. Read more here. – Adrianna Rodriguez Scientists from Nevada argue in a new study that forest fire smoke can increase the risk of contracting the coronavirus. A study published last week by scientists at the Desert Research Institute found that coronavirus infection rates rose disproportionately during the 2020 forest fire season, when smoke from fires in neighboring states covered much of northern Nevada. In an article in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, Desert Research Institute researcher Daniel Kiser and four co-authors note that the test positive rate in Washoe County was during times when monitors measured high levels of particulate matter in the air , wildfire smoke increased significantly. For every 10 micrograms per cubic meter of tiny particles known as PM2.5 in the air, the positivity rate increased by about 6.3% two to six days later, the study found. Kiser said the study was an observation and found the increase was due to other factors, such as the second increase last year, student return to schools, or changes in local restrictions. However, he said brief spikes during periods of high pollution suggest a link between smoke and the spread of the virus. “This temporary connection in the midst of a huge surge in overall cases convinced us that something was going on,” he told the Associated Press. Shelby County Schools, Tennessee’s largest district, will continue to require masks from all students and staff regardless of vaccination status, the district said. All district students must return to face-to-face learning on August 9 for the first time since the district closed in March 2020. Since then, personal participation has been optional for students. The teachers had to return in person in March last year. The district says it is encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations but will not require them from students or staff. “The district is aware of the increasing cases and the spread of the Delta variant,” says the SCS announcement. The move is in line with guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday urging students to study in person this school year and requiring all people to wear masks in schools regardless of vaccination status. – Laura Testino, Commercial Appeal in Memphis Contribution: The Associated Press"
Twitter Suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene for Posting Coronavirus Misinformation,4519,"SAN FRANCISCO – Twitter announced Monday that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene would be suspended from her duty for 12 hours after posting news that violated her policy on disclosing misleading information about the coronavirus. Ms. Greene, a Republican from Georgia, was a staunch opponent of vaccines and masks as a means of containing the pandemic. In tweets on Sunday and Monday, she argued that Covid-19 is not dangerous for people unless they are obese or over 65 and said vaccines shouldn’t be required. But cases of the coronavirus are on the rise, and the highly contagious Delta variant accounts for more than half of all new infections in the United States, federal health officials said this month. In Ms. Greene’s home state of Georgia, new cases have increased 193 percent in the past two weeks. Twitter said Ms. Greene’s tweets were misinformation and banned her from duty until Tuesday. “We have initiated enforcement measures against the account @mtgreenee for violating the Twitter rules, in particular the misleading Covid-19 information guidelines,” said a Twitter spokesman. The company also added labels to Ms. Greene’s posts about the vaccines, calling them “misleading” and pointing out information about the safety of the vaccines. In a statement, Ms. Greene said Silicon Valley companies are working with the White House to attack freedom of expression. “These big tech companies are doing the Biden regime’s commandments to restrict our voices and prevent the distribution of messages that are not state-approved,” she said. Twitter took action after President Biden urged social media companies to do more to combat the spread of vaccine misinformation on their platforms. On Friday, Mr Biden said sites like Facebook “kill people” by allowing misinformation to flourish unchallenged, adding, “Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and that – and they are killing people . “ His statement ended weeks of frustration in the White House over the spread of online misinformation that resulted in hesitant vaccination, health officials say. Facebook, which took the brunt of the criticism, argued that Mr Biden’s testimony was unfounded. “The Biden administration has chosen to blame a handful of American social media companies,” said Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, in a blog post on Saturday. “The fact is that the adoption of vaccines by Facebook users in the US has increased.” On Monday, the president tempered his criticism, saying that it was not Facebook but certain users who were responsible for the spread of misinformation. The company should do more to combat “the outrageous misinformation” spreading on its platform rather than taking what it says is a personal insult, added Mr Biden. Twitter has long banned users from sharing misinformation about the coronavirus that could cause harm. In March, the company rolled out a policy explaining penalties for sharing lies about the virus and vaccines. Updated July 19, 2021, 9:32 p.m. ET “We have seen the emergence of persistent conspiracy theories, alarmist rhetoric that is baseless in research or credible reporting, and a wide range of baseless rumors that, out of context, can deter the public from making informed decisions about their health and individuals, families, and others communities at risk, “the company said in its policy against the disclosure of Covid misinformation. Individuals who violate this policy are subject to escalating penalties known as strikes and could face a permanent ban if they repeatedly spread misinformation about the virus. A twelve-hour ban, as Ms. Greene learns, is Twitter’s response to users who have either two or three strikes. After four strikes, Twitter bans users for seven days, and after five strikes, Twitter bans the user altogether. Other Republicans who have been banned from Twitter have complained that the social media company is censoring them. In January, President Donald J. Trump banned Twitter after the company found his social media posts played a role in inciting violence during the riot in the U.S. Capitol. Mr Trump has argued that Twitter and Facebook, which also blocked his account, censored him, saying the companies need government oversight. Ms. Greene had previously been banned from Twitter in April, but the company said it was a bug caused by one of its automated spam and abuse detection systems. “Everyone knows this is a LIE and it wasn’t a mistake,” Ms. Greene tweeted after her suspension was lifted."
Pediatrics experts recommend all wear masks at schools: COVID news,8077,"The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued recommendations for the 2021-22 school year that include anyone over the age of 2 who wear masks regardless of vaccination status. The Academy also “strongly” recommends face-to-face learning and urges anyone who may be eligible to get vaccinated to protect against COVID-19. AAP said it reinforces recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for ventilation, testing, quarantine, cleaning and disinfection of buildings in the updated guidelines. Dr. Sonja O’Leary, chair of the AAP Council on School Health, said the pandemic has taken a “heartbreaking toll” on children. “Our priority must be getting children back into school with their friends and teachers – and we are all helping to ensure that it happens safely,” said O’Leary. The announcement comes as new coronavirus cases surge across the country. Infections rose on Sunday in all 50 states for the fourth day in a row on a seven-day moving average, an ominous run that has not been seen since the spike in spring 2020. The weekly rolling average for cases in the United States nearly tripled in the past month. The number of deaths has also risen sharply – 24.7% from its low point two weeks ago. Fact check:COVID-19 vaccines do not cause magnetic reactions or contain tracking devices Also on the news: ►US stocks, which traded at record highs for the past few days, fell sharply in early Monday trading on concerns that the pandemic is worsening in hotspots around the world. Global stocks swooned too. ► United States MP Vern Buchanan, R-Florida, said Monday he tested positive for the COVID-19 virus despite being fully vaccinated. He said he had mild flu-like symptoms. ►A federal judge allows Indiana University to continue its COVID-19 vaccine requirement for all students and staff. Eight IU students who tried to block the request. ► Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte urges people to go back to work from home. Dutch infection rates skyrocketed soon after the government eased almost all lockdown measures last month, including reopening nightclubs. ► Right-wing British commentator Katie Hopkins was deported from Australia on Monday after bragging on social media about planning to break quarantine rules. Hopkins was scheduled to appear on a reality TV show and was in mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine in Sydney. Today’s numbers: There have been more than 34 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 609,000 deaths in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The global totals: More than 190.5 million cases and 4 million deaths. According to the CDC, more than 161.2 million Americans – 48.6% of the population – have been fully vaccinated.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said a “seasonal pattern” that primarily affects the Sun Belt states is largely responsible for the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. DeSantis, a Republican who opposes virus-related mandates, said he thinks “not the way to reach the people” to berate or ridicule people who have concerns about the vaccine or who just don’t want it. But he said it was important that people get vaccinated. “If you’re vaccinated and test positive but don’t get sick, the game is keeping people out of the hospital,” DeSantis said. “Seventy-five percent of Florida’s over 50s have had an injection, we think that’s very, very positive.” Kara Eaker, a deputy of the U.S. women’s gymnastics team, tested positive for COVID, coach Al Fong confirmed in a text message to USA TODAY Sports. The alternate Leanne Wong, who trains with Eaker, is also in quarantine after being classified as close contact, Fong said. The opening ceremony of the Tokyo Games is scheduled for Friday. US tennis star Coco Gauff announced on Sunday that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and announced that she would retire from the Tokyo Olympics a few days before the Games begin. Olympic organizers announced on Sunday that three residents of the Olympic village, including two athletes, had tested positive for COVID-19, although arrival logs were initially clarified. A bipartisan group of criminal justice advocates is calling on President Joe Biden to pardon and commute sentences given to federal prisoners who were allowed to serve their sentences at home because of the pandemic but now have the option to return to prison. Lawyers have urged Biden to use his powers aggressively, citing his campaign promise to reduce federal prisons. “This is your opportunity to give thousands of people who are already safely out of prison a second chance to reintegrate into society, reconnect with loved ones, find a job and get back to school go, “said the letter from 20 interest groups on Monday. including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, and NAACP. Two other Democratic state Texas lawmakers who fled to Washington, DC to prevent the passage of a restrictive GOP-backed electoral law tested positive for COVID-19, according to the leadership of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, despite them have been vaccinated. This increases the total to five. A group of MPs took a private plane to Washington, DC, to campaign in Congress to pass federal electoral reform. However, lawmakers drew some criticism after photos appeared from the plane showing them traveling without masks. The federal pandemic guidelines require masks to be worn on commercial flights, but not on private aircraft. More and more experts are calling for vaccinated people to mask themselves as COVID rises across the country. Nearly 5,500 fully vaccinated people have been hospitalized or have died of COVID-19, among the more than 160 million people who were fully vaccinated, the CDC reports. “Instead of cheating OR masking it, the emerging data suggests that CDC should advise numbing and masking it in areas of (increasing) cases and positivity until we see the numbers go down again,” the former US -General surgeon Dr. Jerome Adams said on Twitter. “If I’m in an area where I think there might be a lot of unvaccinated people, I’ll be careful when wearing my mask indoors,” said current US surgeon general Dr. Vivek Murthy to CNN. Public health officials for the Biden government targeted social media platforms like Facebook on Sunday for being seen as inactive to stop misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines. It comes two days after the President himself said that internet untruths “kill people”. Alerted by the rise in coronavirus infections across the country and frustrated by ongoing conspiracy theories about the pandemic, public health officials are more critical of the media and technology platforms that they claim are putting the public at risk. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the federal government’s top health advisor, said on Sunday that “misinformation is still spreading like wildfire in our country, supported by technology platforms”. – Matthew Brown UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will self-isolate for 10 days after contact with a confirmed coronavirus case. His office’s announcement on Sunday reversed an earlier statement that, unlike most people, he would not be quarantined. Johnson met with Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Friday, who later tested positive for COVID-19. Contact persons from positive cases usually have to self-isolate for 10 days. Johnson contracted the disease in April 2020 and spent several days in the hospital before making a full recovery. The UK government is still planning to lift any remaining legal restrictions on social contact and other public health measures on Monday, despite the UK registering more than 50,000 new cases of COVID-19 for the first time in six months and a terrible warning from The UK UK Government’s chief medical advisor.

adyn founder Elizabeth Ruzzo is on a mission to make scientific discovery more inclusive,6585,"adyn CEO Elizabeth Ruzzo. (adyn photo) As a scientist, Elizabeth Ruzzo likes to make decisions based on data. When she went through trial and error with several doctors trying to find a method of contraception that would not make her unhappy, she was angry and confused. She consulted a doctor only to learn what she called “medical gaslighting” about her symptoms. “I decided to devote my expertise in precision medicine to promoting a new standard of care,” said Ruzzo. Part of that journey took her to adyn, a startup she founded and runs in Seattle, which is launching a test this fall to analyze genetic and hormonal data in women and identify possible side effects caused by various methods of birth control. “Adyn’s scientific approach means eliminating painful years of trial, error, and even self-doubt,” said Ruzzo, our newest geek of the week. Ruzzo said she has been interested in understanding the genetic causes of human disease since learning about DNA. Born and raised in Seattle, she received her PhD in human genetics and genomics from Duke University and learned how to analyze data from a technology then emerging called next generation sequencing. “My research included exploring how biology and genetic markers can be used to understand disease and predict drug response,” she said. “I discovered over 36 genes and linked them to certain human diseases and also used machine learning to uncover 16 new autism genes, which provides clear evidence of an inherited risk of autism.” Ruzzo’s mission at adyn is to make scientific discoveries more inclusive and to fill the gaps caused by what Ruzzo calls “historical inequality in medical research”. “Medical studies are targeting men and people of European descent, which keeps hindering our ability to develop integrative diagnoses and treatments that help everyone,” she said. “People who use adyn to optimize their birth control can register as anonymous research participants to fill the gap in medical gender and race research.” There are a number of different directions in precision medicine that the startup is exploring beyond birth control side effect testing. adyn raised $ 2.5 million in April. After studying in North Carolina and Los Angeles, Ruzzo said she couldn’t resist the chance to build adyn in Seattle amid the booming tech scene. When she’s not working, she likes to cook, train and play soccer. Find out more about our newest geek of the week, Elizabeth Ruzzo: What is the most important thing people should know about your specialty? There are so many important and surprising things to know about precision medicine and genetics, so I’ll give you two: In terms of DNA, we are all 99.9% the same. It is this 0.1% that makes every person unique – from their appearance to their response to medication. These tiny differences can explain why you react differently to a particular drug than your friend or even your sibling. Women did not have to be enrolled in clinical trials in the United States until 1993. This gap in medical research has had a massive impact on women’s health: women are more likely than men to experience drug side effects because drug dosage recommendations were based on clinical trials conducted on men in the past. Where do you find your inspiration? Past and present scientists who make discoveries and share them with the world. Also the stories of the Adyn community … women shared their contraceptive odyssey with us and I read each one. No two stories are alike, but the effects wrong (or right) birth control can have are amazing. Which technology could you not do without and why? DNA sequencing. This technology has allowed me to identify the causes of several diseases and it inspires me to continue making discoveries about human biology. What does your workplace look like and why does it work for you? I finally cracked and bought a standing desk converter. I love my external monitor and my solar powered keyboard. I have a window in my office that makes it possible to have (and keep alive) a plant that I’ve heard can relieve stress, increase productivity, and even increase creativity. I also have a scientific illustration of a rhinoceros my sister drew behind me, which adds a touch of allure to an otherwise pretty normal workplace! Your best tip or trick for coping with everyday work and life. (Help us, we need it.) We are a distributed team with a strong line-up of east coast riders. As a West Coaster, I spend the first hours of the day making phone calls and meetings. I’ve adjusted my schedule so that I take a break from training at the end of the East Coast lessons and then go back to things. It gives my brain and eyes a break from screen time and boosts my energy for the rest of the day. Mac, Windows or Linux? Mac. Favorite superhero or science fiction character? Deanna Troi (also my 4th grade Halloween costume). Transporter, time machine or invisibility cloak? Transporter all the way! My wish-list of destinations and friends to visit is far too long for any other choice. If someone gave me $ 1 million to start a startup, I would … They did! And I started adyn. I got in line for … Taco truck tacos (OK, maybe more than once). Your role models: My grandmother. She was 103 years old and would have lived longer without Covid. She lived through the Great Depression and taught me the importance of not wasting anything. She was a home economics teacher and an incredible quilter. She always loved good jokes (even the slightly inappropriate ones). She was stubborn and independent. She lived alone for years and continued to quilt even though she was legally blind. She made a mean devil egg and was more popular than I’ll ever be. Greatest game in history: “Code names.” Best gadget ever: Bluetooth audio sunglasses – these are at the top of my “Treat yourself” list. First computer: PowerBook G3. Current phone: iPhones. Favorite app: Insight timer. Favorite cause: Health equity. Most important technology of 2021: adyns birth control optimization test. Most important technology of 2023: Personalized medicine for everything – birth control, anxiety, depression, AD (H) D, acne, etc. Final advice for your fellow freaks: I’ve wasted a lot of time and energy in my career fighting Impostor Syndrome. What I noticed is that nobody knows what they’re doing (definitely not at first). So work hard, stay curious, and be open to learning. Build your expertise and trust your own hard work. Surround yourself with people who are similarly curious and hardworking. Website: Surname Twitter: @sequinlabcoat LinkedIn: Elizabeth Ruzzo"
VanMoof X3 e-bike review: Transportation revelation – TechCrunch,16644,"Like some of the best consumer tech from the last decade, I didn’t know I needed an e-bike until I was on one, breezing down the bike lane contemplating my newfound freedom. Before buying a Nintendo Switch, I would have never guessed how much a candy-colored gaming console that I could pop out of a dock and into my backpack for long flight would fill me with joy. An e-bike, particularly this e-bike, the VanMoof X3, feels like that. I live in Portland, Oregon, land of ample bike lanes and naked bike rides. When I first moved here, I biked everywhere, but that habit slowly dissolved over the years. First, I bought a car for weekend camping trips, which slowly became weekday errand running. A few years later, I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and suddenly found myself much less confident in what my body could do and where it could comfortably take me. Over time, my bike would only see a handful of rides a season on beautiful days, when I’d always sigh and think I wish I biked more — it makes me feel good! Before testing the X3, I’d find excuses to drive short distances instead of riding my bike. What if I got tired and didn’t feel like biking home? What if it starts pouring rain? What’s if it’s too hot? What if I’m too sweaty when I get to the office? Riding an e-bike erases most of those concerns outright. The X3 is an effortless enough ride that I can still zoom to work if it’s 95+ degrees out. It’s fast enough that I can get out of a surprise rainstorm quickly if need be. If I don’t want to be sweaty at the start of the day, I can lean on sweet, sweet electricity to whisk me away, rolling up to my office without breaking a sweat. And it can’t go unstated that going fast on a bike — the whole time, with as much or little effort as you feel like putting in — is really, really fun. If you haven’t had a chance to try an e-bike, know that the sensation of effortlessly zipping around, electricity near-imperceptibly humming beneath you, is difficult to describe and best experienced first-hand. VanMoof’s handsome pair of high tech bikes, the X3 and its larger cousin the S3, are far from the only options on the market, so some of their pluses would hold true for any electric bike. But that doesn’t make the VanMoof interchangeable either. The VanMoof X3 has a very specific look, feel and feature set that will perfectly suit a certain kind of rider (myself included) but other e-bike shoppers will still want to play the field. We’ll get into that — here goes! Matrix display shows battery life, speed and other key info. I tested the VanMoof X3 over the S3 not by choice — its geometry is a little wacky looking in pictures — but because I’m 5’4″. The X3, which fits anybody from 5′-6’5″, is a little smaller and less traditional looking than the S3, which suits anyone taller than 5’8″. The X3 has 24″ wheels rather than the S3’s 28″ wheels and it has a little bungee-corded platform in the front where presumably you could carry something, but I still have no idea what (You can also buy an add-on front basket that slots in there and looks very cute.) Like most e-bikes, the X3 is much, much heavier than a normal road or commuter bike. The listed weight is 45.8 lbs and you’ll feel every pound of it if you ever need to carry it very far. I live in a standalone house in Portland, Oregon and had to carry the X3 down a very short front step to ride it — totally fine! I used to live in a fifth floor walkup in Brooklyn and carrying it up or down that would have been impossible. If you can’t store the X3 (or most any e-bike) around ground level with access to a charger, it might not be a good fit for you. (Note that in our pictures, the small platform above the chain area is where an optional external battery pack, discussed later, sits. The platform is removable.) Though on paper I’d prefer the look of the S3, the X3 doesn’t look strange at all IRL, whether parked or with somebody riding it. It’s cute, futuristic but not conspicuous and gets plenty of compliments. My wife described its aesthetic as “Death Star chic” and while I don’t totally know what that means, she’s not wrong. On the way to my office a sanitation truck driver rolled down his window to bellow “HEY—THAT’S A REALLY COOL BIKE.” Thanks, my dude! The current generation of VanMoof e-bikes are coated in matte paint and you can choose between a classic, sexy matte black or a pleasantly cheery matte light blue. A previous version of the bikes used glossy coating, but apparently the matte is supposed to be more scratch resistant. The paint does seem pretty tough though it’s not totally bombproof. Somehow the handlebars picked up a little nick in the paint, though I still have no idea where it came from or what did it (owls?). Something important to note is that neither the VanMoof X3 or S3 look like e-bikes. They don’t have an ugly bulge jutting out from the frame and the top tube and down tube are both thick but uniform — and not so thick you’d think twice about it. The electronic components are nestled away in the frame and even the drivetrain is tucked away and enclosed. And while there’s a deeply cool LED matrix display embedded in the top tube, only the rider really sees it. For anyone looking for an e-bike that doesn’t scream e-bike!!!! the VanMoof is one of the best choices if not the best choice you could make. It’s an awesome looking bike — not just an awesome looking e-bike. VanMoof X3 in the city of roses. The VanMoof X3 is a nice-looking bike — you get it. But what about, you know, the biking? I can confidently report that from the first time you hop on it to your twentieth commute to work, the X3 is an absolute joy to ride. As an e-bike newcomer I had reservations. Would the electric assistance cheapen the magic of riding a bike? Do I really want a bike doing the shifting for me? As it turns out, quite the opposite and yes, absolutely. The VanMoof X3 (and its sibling the S3) give you an electric boost while pedaling — you’ll still be pedaling but it feels enticingly easy and you’ll go faster with less effort. The bike also features a Turbo Boost button on the right-side handlebar that gives you a big boost on top of the smoother normal electronic assistance, up to 20 miles per hour in the U.S. You can choose the amount of help that you want. Using the VanMoof app, which we’ll get to, or a physical button, you can select what level of power assist you’d like from zero to four. Zero is you pedaling a heavy-ass bike alone with no help (it sucks) and four makes everything feel so easy there’s almost no way to break a sweat. In my time testing the bike, I’d use “two” when I felt like getting a bit of a workout with extra pep in my pedal, four when I was in a hurry to get to my co-working space in the mornings and three the rest of the time, like riding to brunch on a weekend. Being able to choose the level of pedal assistance is a huge perk and it makes the bike feel flexible for different uses. The kick lock button, back wheel and enclosed chain. Whatever mode you’re on, the turbo boost button is a killer feature. It flattens steep hills and makes it feel way safer to zip across busy intersections where you’re not sure drivers are paying attention. It’s fun and awesome for safe, defensive city riding. It takes a little bit to get used to the automatic electronic shifting but that’s silky smooth too. I initially assumed that, like many things that worked perfectly well before having some extraneous “smart” high-tech nonsense draped over them (fridges! lamps! vibrators!) the technology would fail just often enough to be a nuisance. After a long period of testing, I can report that the X3 rides as smooth and seamless as ever. Every once in a while I’d crunch down on the pedal or a gear won’t catch right away but it’s super rare. You can even use the app to customize when the bike shifts up and down and it’s worth playing around with that to find something that feels just right. What else? The X3’s maximum assisted speed is in the U.S. is 20 mph (32km/hr), but anyone in Europe will be limited to 15.5 mph (25km/hr). The U.S. speed feels great and it’s painless to get up to 20mph and maintain that speed with the X3 in a way I’d have to destroy my quads to manage otherwise, even on my zippy non-electric road bike. Beyond that, the seat is very comfy and the ride is pleasantly upright and natural. After riding the X3 for a while I had a hard time going back to hunching over on my (adorable) little Bianchi and pined for the comfy ride I’d gotten so used to. Tail light from the future. The VanMoof X3 is an excellent value, all things considered. The company has a weird habit of tinkering with its pricing, but after a redesign and a colossal price drop in 2020 ($3,398 to $1,998 at the time) the bikes feel very well priced. Now they’re retailing for $2,298 — $300 more than the previous price but still a fine deal for anyone looking for a very full-featured e-bike without spending more than around $2,000. That’s not very much more than you’d spend on a regular bike, sans electricity and many, many cool bells and whistles. And if you’re into higher end bikes, it could even be a lot less. It’s also substantially less than the high end of e-bike competition, which the VanMoof bikes feel like they compete with, even with the wallet-friendlier price tag. Still, it’s kind of stressful that VanMoof is quietly messing around with the pricing with the bikes already out in the wild. It would suck to plan to buy one only to see the price shoot up before you’d pulled the trigger. The company should be more transparent about this, giving set future dates for planned price changes. There also seem to be updates within generations of the bikes, so an X3 you buy now might differ from an X3 you could buy in 2020. That’s confusing and all of it should be made clearer somewhere obvious on the website. The VanMoof app’s in-app ride tracking and summary stats. One of the biggest considerations with an e-bike (or an e-anything!) is range. VanMoof says the X3’s range is 37 miles using “full power” and up to 93 miles in economy mode. If you’re getting 93 miles out of the battery, you probably aren’t even using the pedal assistance at all, so you can just toss that number out. The low end estimate of 37 miles might be a little generous for someone who’s using the bike on the fourth power assistance level and smashing the turbo boost regularly, but 35-45 miles feels about right from my testing (usually mode 3 or 4, occasionally 2, light use of turbo button). The range feels good. Even using the X3 most days out of the week, charging is infrequent enough to never feel annoying. In my case, that meant daily short rides (2.5-5 miles, usually) and the occasional longer ride (10-20 miles). If you’re using the X3 or S3 to commute to work somewhere that’s farther away, you’re going to find yourself plugging in more. Even so, I never got into a situation where I was concerned that I’d run out of battery far from home. And even if you do, you can still pedal the bike — it’s just really heavy. Most people will probably charge up overnight, but you can fill up the battery in four hours if you need to. Something to note is that you’ll plug in a wall charger directly to the bike to charge it. For anyone who can’t charge and store the X3 on ground level, know you’ll have to carry the whole dang bike to an outlet. The lack of a removable battery might be a strike against the VanMoof bikes for folks who live in walk-ups or small apartments, but for people with somewhere easy to store it, this wasn’t something I thought twice about. While the built-in range is totally adequate for a lot of use cases, VanMoof just introduced an external add-on battery pack for both the X3 and S3. The battery slots into a little platform, pictured below and mounted on our test bike, and it extends the X3’s range considerably. VanMoof sells the PowerBank accessory for $348. The thing isn’t small — it weighs six pounds — but VanMoof says it’ll give you anywhere from 28 to 62 miles of extra range. Again, almost nobody is going to hit the high end of this, but even at the low end it almost doubles the bike’s existing range. External PowerBank via VanMoof The PowerBank is big and pretty clunky. It doesn’t look awful, but it definitely makes the X3 look like an e-bike. It’s not elegant like the removable battery on the Cowboy, another extremely handsome e-bike, but it’s ok. If everything else about a VanMoof suits you perfectly but you need more range, it’s great to have the option, even if you’ll be shelling out for it. The tech bells and whistles are something that really makes the VanMoof X3 and S3 stand out from the crowd. The X3’s price feels reasonable for a reliable, great-looking e-bike, but on top of that you’ll be getting an electric steed with some pretty sweet tricks: VanMoof support for “Find My” app in iOS Overall, something great about the X3 is that the tech features aren’t just fancy tricks — they really enhance the experience. And even so, they’re optional. You can ride the bike and benefit from the power assistance without using the app. You can use a regular lock and skip the alarm system if you choose to, or use a physical button code to disable it manually. You can change the power assistance mode with the same button. This is all huge and lets you use the e-bike how you want to. Personally, I’d never buy an e-bike that required connectivity, a phone or an app to operate it; that’s just asking for trouble. Shipping and Assembly: The VanMoof X3 and S3 come in the mail in a big box. The assembly process was almost painless — except for this one really fiddly bit you have to slide into another fiddly bit which took me the better part of an hour and some searching on the VanMoof subreddit (not the only one with this problem!) Extra Support: VanMoof offers three paid plans to keep your bike in working order and in your possession. You can buy a three-year maintenance plan for $348, a three-year theft recovery plan for $398 or a combined plan for $690 (broken down via VanMoof below). Maintenance: Where you live should be a major consideration when thinking about buying a VanMoof. In my time testing it for reliability over an extended period, I was surprised by how few problems came up. I had to mess around with re-centering the front wheel at some point because a brake pad was rubbing, but aside from occasional app connectivity issues, that was pretty much it. Of course, significant wear and tear means any bike could benefit from a pro tune up from someone who knows the model. VanMoof has full-fledged stores in Amsterdam, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Tokyo. Beyond its flagship stores, the company relies on an expanding network of service centers and “certified workshops” to maintain its bikes, so be sure to check what’s near you. Personally, I’d want to be near enough to a VanMoof store or at least a service center to guarantee my $2,000+ investment and its many, many technological bits could be maintained in perfect health. Nobody wants to ship a bike back for repairs, especially a heavy, technologically complex one. Prior to testing out the X3, e-bikes aren’t something I’d thought a lot about and I wasn’t really sure who they were for. I first heard of VanMoof a couple of years ago when a close friend and much more serious biker than me bought one for towing her dog (the goodest girl) on a long work commute. We rode to the farmer’s market together and her bike looked very cool, but I was skeptical that something with so much technology under the hood could prove reliable over time. Bikes are mechanical and simple — that’s something wonderful about them! Could an e-bike really translate the joyful simplicity of biking into something much more high tech? As it turns out, yes. After test riding the VanMoof X3 to get a sense of its reliability over time and how its features hold up in normal day-to-day use, I regret my early skepticism. I don’t know if I can overstate how much riding an e-bike, specifically this e-bike, enhanced my life in small ways for the better while I tried it out. Biking more — and e-bikes do get people biking more — makes me happier and healthier. Biking more has helped me ease out of the intensely sedentary pandemic period into new habits that make me feel more connected to the world around me. I’m seeing my city with fresh eyes, biking to new neighborhoods I’ve never explored and appreciating all of the little things I took for granted. My only e-bike regret is not hopping on one sooner."
Native American activists urge Biden to hear them out on sacred lands,6815,"Two dozen Native American activists in 10 cars are hauling a totem pole across the country. While this protest caravan may seem small, its message to Congress is oversized: give tribal peoples a say before granting access to land that tribal peoples consider sacred. The counter-argument: public land is there for everyone and the nation’s energy needs cannot be ignored. Nowhere is this debate more heated than at the Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah, a formidable archaeological and natural wonder that activists will accomplish on Saturday. Former President Barack Obama reserved 1.35 million acres for the memorial at the end of 2016. Conservatives criticized the move as a government excess, and then-President Donald Trump reduced the size of Bears Ears by 85% in 2017. His fate is still at stake. “Holy places and public lands are under sustained pressure from climate chaos and fossil fuel reliance, and we believe that under this administration we can change the role of federal government in that equation,” said Judith LeBlanc, director of the Native Organizers Alliance who spoke to USA TODAY as the caravan passed through Utah. “This is the political moment.” Local organizers were helped by the appointment of former US Congressman Deb Haaland of Laguna Pueblo, New Mexico to lead the Home Office and President Joe Biden’s restoration of the White House Native American Council. Activists say the role of indigenous peoples in the recent elections should give them more say in policies that can help provide tribes with jobs, education and health care. “Native Americans need to be at the decision-making table,” said LeBlanc, who belongs to the Caddo Nation of the southeastern states. For most of the country’s nearly 600 nationally recognized tribes, land use and ownership are a top priority. While some tribes have succeeded on that front – last year the Supreme Court ruled that half of Oklahoma is on indigenous land, which had an impact on legal proceedings – most have spent the last few years protesting access to state , many of them in Indian countries granted by the Trump Administration to energy and mining companies. From the Gila River to Bears Ears: Environmental activists renew their push to protect public land in the American Southwest amid changing politics The result, say activists, is deep concern over land looting by fracking and oil pipelines, which are often of deep historical and religious significance to the indigenous people. “Just as Notre Dame Cathedral is a symbolic structure for Catholicism, these landscapes are our cathedral,” said Pat Gonzales-Rogers, executive director of the Inter-Tribal Council of Bears Ears, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “We ask people to be in the same respectful mindset and show respect for this landscape as our people and tribal leaders do.” Gonzales-Rogers added that while no sacred site is more important than another, Bears Ears, named after two towering ear-like buttes, is likely to test the power of the Presidency when it comes to oversight of the Antiquities Act of 1906, empowered by the President to “declare historical landmarks by public proclamation”. Bears Ears supporters say Obama did this when he made it a memorial in one of his final gestures in office. Critics say the law was not designed to make such large areas of land available, potentially restricting access to a number of users. “This bill should be used to prevent looting for the smallest negotiable area,” said Jeffrey McCoy, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian public-interest law firm that represented ranchers who said Obama’s statement denied them access Land took a long time. This case has been put on hold as Biden is reviewing his predecessor’s action. McCoy said it is not up to the presidents of either party to decide the fate of massive state holdings, but “that is the job of Congress and the National Park Declaration.” Bears Ears chairman Gonzales-Rogers said activists are pushing lawmakers to increase the size of the national monument over what Obama has granted to nearly 2 million acres. Realizing that the fate of the Indian country has long been tied to federal politics, various indigenous groups came up with the idea of ​​driving from Washington State to Washington, DC, and stopping at some of the most controversial indigenous holy sites. The journey, called Red Road to DC: A Tote Pole Journey for the Protection of Sacred Places – a name that refers to a journey from addiction to sobriety – started last week in the coastal nation of Lummi north of Seattle and ends with events on the nation’s capital on July 29th. Stops along the meandering trail include Chaco Canyon in New Mexico (July 18), where fracking is underway in an area where thousands lived between AD 850 and AD 1200; Standing Rock, North Dakota (July 24), the site of years of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline; and Mackinaw City, Michigan, where tribes are fighting to close a pipeline over fear a spill could contaminate lake water. Dig deeper into race and identity: Subscribe to This Is America, USA TODAY newsletter The idea of ​​taking the trip along with a massive carved totem pole was in line with best protest tradition: having something that makes those who see it ask questions, LeBlanc said. “It’s about raising people’s awareness of what is happening to our nation’s land,” she said. Totem poles are a traditional feature of the Indian tribes from the Pacific Northwest and are considered sacred symbols. This particular totem was made by Lummi artisans called House of Tears Carvers over three months. It is 25 feet high, 43 inches wide, and was carved from 400 year old red cedar. The predominant imagery of the colorful totem includes an eagle plunging to earth, a praying man, and a salmon. There is also a woman with a girl nearby, a tribute to the way grandmothers often teach the Aboriginal customs and language to the younger generation. Also carved into the totem are seven tears that, according to the organizers of Red Road to DC, represent seven generations of Native Americans who have suffered at the hands of non-natives. As the caravan continues, activists hope to use the totem and their gatherings to draw attention to the universal need to protect nature at a time when climate crises – from fires in the west to storms in the east – are a growing threat. Native Americans, they argue, are uniquely willing to be stewards of land that once belonged to them alone. “Since the beginning of time, our peoples have gone to sacred places to collect medicines, connect with our ancestors, pray, and lift their spirits,” said LeBlanc. “We know how best to preserve and protect these places to ensure that these places continue to be there for our people and all people.”"
The Morning After: Valve made a $399 handheld gaming PC,2861,"Valve surprised us all with a handheld console. The $ 399 Steam Deck will arrive in December, with availability expanding to additional regions later. The hardware looks like an unholy alliance between Sega’s Game Gear and the Nintendo Switch and contains a 7-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 1,280 x 800 and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. There is also no lack of control options, with two thumbsticks, two fairly large square trackpads, an old-school D-pad, four main buttons, triggers, and a quartet of grip buttons. Valve Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is barely a foot long. Esh. Valve made sure there was enough power inside to seduce PC gamers who already have an extensive Steam library. There is an AMD 2.4-3.5 GHz processor and a 1.0 to 1.6 GHz GPU with eight RDNA 2 processing units. Inside there is 16 GB of LPDDR5 RAM. Valve promises a battery life of between two and eight hours on a single charge, depending on how much power you need for your games. Given the power many AAA PC games require, you can probably expect many experiences to be around the lower estimates. While the Steam Deck may not be as powerful as your gaming PC, Valve uses Proton, a compatibility layer that allows games to run without developers having to work on porting titles – you apparently have access to your full library of games. That price point makes it a little more expensive than the Switch and the same price as the all-digital PS5. However, because of its steam hooks, it’s an entirely different proposition. How Well Do PC Games Play on a 7 Inch Handheld? – Mat Smith Kris Naudus / Engadget Elgato’s first $ 200 web camera isn’t that unique. It’s a chunky rectangular box that you can easily clip onto a monitor, and it lacks a microphone or something that approaches 4K resolution. It shoots 1080p at 60 fps, which should be enough for streamers that use the camera output as picture-in-picture. Continue reading.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The importance of being vaccinated,12556,"It has been neck and neck for a while, and honestly, I was ready to cheer a vaccine victory. We nearly dropped to an average of fewer than 10,000 new cases a day, an important number because, according to President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, that number moves the country into “containment” — a time when we would finally get our arms around the spread. We came tantalizingly close: 11,299 cases in late June. But, then the variants caught some speed, and the vaccine started to fall behind; we are now at an average of 23,472 new cases a day as of Tuesday, and all indications point to that number rising. There are many countries around the world that now are seeing case rates increase against a backdrop of sparse vaccine supply. Here in the United States, we have plenty of vaccine available, a precious commodity almost every country around the world wishes they had. We have the means to distribute vaccines and have even made them totally free of charge. I believe most of us also fundamentally understand the best way to get a handle on the pandemic and return fully to life as we know it is to vaccinate enough people. What we are lacking is the will. It may be that some parts of the country really haven’t gotten the memo on the importance of vaccines — or even worse, they are receiving another far more insidious message: that it’s the vaccines themselves that are the problem. They aren’t the problem. They are our best shot at being rescued from this ongoing pandemic. Research from the Commonwealth Fund estimates the Covid-19 vaccines have already saved about 280,000 lives and averted up to 1.25 million hospitalizations in the United States. A vaccine protects not only the person getting it but those around them as well — including children under the age of 12, for whom the current coronavirus vaccines are not yet authorized, or those who have weakened immune systems that prevent their bodies from generating a strong immune response after vaccination. That is the very definition of herd immunity: providing a ring of protection around the vulnerable. In order to get there, around 70% of people need to be fully vaccinated. That level of immunity will make it so that we are no longer such willing hosts to the virus and put us on a path to eventually run it out of town. The vaccines also directly protect us from future variants; mutated versions of the virus that emerge in infected people and can be more contagious than the original strain. Right now, it’s the Delta variant that is wreaking havoc in the United States and elsewhere, but the more the virus spreads, the higher the chances another variant of concern will take its place. Vaccinations slow these mutations from happening because if a person doesn’t get infected in the first place, their body can’t possibly become a breeding ground for a mutation. President Joe Biden set what initially appeared to be an attainable goal: have 70% of the adult population with at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot by July 4th. But after months of steady vaccine progress, the numbers began to dwindle and the goal was missed. Currently about 59% of the US population has at least one dose and 48% is fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that doesn’t tell the full story. The United States cannot be painted with a single brush stroke, and nowhere is that more true than with this pandemic. As things stand now, the top five states have 60% or more of their population fully vaccinated versus less than 36% for the bottom five states. According to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the CDC, states that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents reported an average of 2.8 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people each day last week, compared to an average of about 7.8 cases per 100,000 people each day in states that have vaccinated fewer than half of their residents. That’s almost a three-fold difference. It’s in those states with the highest vaccination rates where you can see the vaccines truly work their magic. It’s not just cases decreasing, but more importantly, hospitalizations and deaths plummeting as well. The vaccines accomplished exactly what they were designed to do. Early data from a number of states suggests that 99.5% of those Covid-19 deaths during the first six months of the year have been in unvaccinated people. Just consider that if a patient in the United States is hospitalized or dies of Covid, 99 times out of 100 they are unvaccinated. Dying at this stage in the pandemic is almost like a soldier dying after a peace treaty has been signed. Heartbreaking and largely preventable. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky called any suffering or death from Covid-19 “tragic,” and noted that available vaccines mean that “the suffering and loss we are now seeing is nearly entirely avoidable.” “We have seen the successes of our vaccination program over the last eight months with cases, hospitalizations and deaths far lower than the peaks we saw in January,” she said. “And yet on the other hand, we are starting to see some new and concerning trends.” One of those trends is the falling rate of vaccination. An average of 282,143 people are reaching “fully vaccinated” status each day — one of the lowest daily rates since the end of January, when vaccination efforts were just picking up steam. And it’s almost a 50% drop from last week, when an average of about 535,000 people became fully vaccinated each day. At our peak in mid-April, an average of nearly 1.8 million people — more than six times as many — were becoming fully vaccinated every day. Another new and concerning trend involves the rise of the Delta variant, which is believed to be much more contagious; it now makes up more than 50% of Covid-19 cases in the US — and in some places, that number tops 80%. Its dominance is making the vaccination issue even more pressing. Fauci called it “a real bad actor virus” on CBS earlier this week. The Delta variant, first identified in India, is likely behind the current uptick in cases. The US is now averaging more than 23,000 new Covid-19 cases each day, according to Johns Hopkins University, almost double two weeks ago. The average number of daily cases is rising in 46 states. And we’re seeing 261 new Covid-19 deaths each day — a 21% increase from last week. Again, deaths that are largely preventable. How contagious is the Delta variant? If you remember back to the start of the pandemic, we measured how infectious a communicable disease is using a mathematical term called R0 (R-nought), also called the reproduction number. It basically estimates the average number of people one infected individual will go on to infect. If the R0 number falls below 1, the disease eventually dies out. According to estimates, the original virus found in Wuhan, China had an R0 between 2.4 and 2.6. The Alpha variant, which had been the dominant variant and was first identified in the United Kingdom, was between 4 and 5. The Delta variant’s reproduction number is estimated to be somewhere between 5 and 8. That means the Delta variant is estimated to be two to three times more contagious than the original virus first seen in Wuhan, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said via email. What does that look like in real life? Unforgiving. A remarkable look at CCTV footage from Australia revealed a simple encounter between two people passing each other at an indoor shopping area that resulted in two separate instances of transmission. The encounter was brief. The premier of New South Wales, where the incidents occurred, even called it “scarily fleeting.” That is why the rise of the Delta variant coupled with low vaccination areas is really worrying public health experts, just as they were ready to start looking at Covid in the rear view mirror. A new data analysis by researchers at Georgetown University has now identified 30 clusters of counties with low vaccination rates and significant population sizes that are vulnerable to surges in Covid-19 cases and could become breeding grounds for even more deadly Covid-19 variants. The five most significant clusters are sprawled across large swaths of the southeastern United States and a smaller portion in the Midwest. No surprise, most are already seeing increases in Covid-19 cases. “We can’t have it both ways; we can’t be both unmasked and unvaccinated. That won’t work,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, said Monday. Or as Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the NIAID and one of the developers of the Moderna vaccine, told me: The country will no longer be split into vaccinated and unvaccinated; it will simply be split into vaccinated and infected. That’s where this road leads. The simple answer is: Get vaccinated. You know that by now, and again, most people do. The doctors, nurses and health care teams recommending this are not political, but I can understand why you might think otherwise lately. During the Conservative Political Action Conference’s summer gathering in Dallas last weekend, attendees cheered author Alex Berenson when he pointed out that the Biden administration fell short of its vaccination goal. At least 34 states as of June have introduced bills that would limit requiring someone to demonstrate their vaccination status or immunity against Covid-19 in certain areas such as workplaces or government buildings, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures; 13 of those bills have passed into law. That includes at least seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah — that enacted legislation this year that would restrict public schools from requiring either coronavirus vaccinations or documentation of vaccination status. And in Tennessee Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician who has served as the state’s medical director of the vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization for two years, says she was fired after she shared information about a decades-old state policy that allowed some teens to be immunized without parental consent. It’s true that there have been a few concerning possible side effects associated with the vaccines. They include reports of a rare neurological condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome developing in some who received the Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine as well as reports of rare blood clots in others; and heart inflammation in a small number of people who received Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. While these are all serious conditions, it’s important to remember these events are very, very rare occurrences out of the almost 185 million people who have received at least one shot in this country. And it’s reassuring to know that in the vast majority of cases, those who developed these side effects recovered. The same can’t be said for Covid-19, which has killed more than 607,000 people in this country, caused almost 34 million infections, and can cause symptoms that linger long after the person has “recovered.” It’s also true there have been breakthrough cases of Covid-19 among the fully vaccinated, but that is to be expected. Even if an infection occurs, the important thing to remember is that the vaccines offer excellent protection against severe disease and death — the two most important outcomes. And that’s true even for the Delta variant, according to recent data from Israel and the United Kingdom.Some progress is being made. A new poll released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that about 20% of Americans who were initially hesitant about or squarely against getting the Covid-19 vaccine have since gotten their shots. Of course, seen from the glass-half-empty perspective, that means 80% haven’t. Convincing most unvaccinated Americans to get their shots will take more time than initial phases of vaccinations, White House Covid-19 chief Jeff Zients told reporters at a Covid-19 response team briefing earlier in the month. “Each person in this phase will take longer to reach, but that makes them no less important. And the spread of the Delta variant, which poses a particular threat to our young people, only strengthens our resolve to reach everyone,” he said. That’s an effort I am 100% behind.

Twitter now lets you change who can reply to your tweets,1437,"Last year, Twitter introduced a few changes that made it easier to choose how to reply to Tweets and manage who can reply to your Tweets. Now a new feature is added that can help you make sure your answer area is clean and friendly. Using the social network, you can now change who can reply to your tweets, even if you have already sent them. All you have to do is tap the ellipsis button in the top right corner of your post and select the “Change who can reply” option. In August last year, the company removed its response-limiting function from the experimentation phase and made it available to all users. On this rollout, you were able to choose who could reply to you – everyone, people you follow, or people you mention – before sending your tweet. This addition gives you even more control over the discussion in your answer area. The new feature is likely part of the platform’s efforts to “improve the health of public conversation,” what Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey previously described as his company’s sole goal. As you can imagine, being able to choose who can answer you has been controversial with some users, but it could also limit the toxic behavior you encounter on the platform.

Why Am I Waking Up at 3 A.M.? Ways to Fight Insomnia and Fall Back Asleep,2704,"It is normal to wake up a few times during the night as the brain goes through various phases of deeper and lighter sleep. Older people also often have to get out of bed once or twice at night to use the toilet. Waking up at night is usually harmless. Most people have no problem getting back to sleep and may not even remember their nightly awakenings the next morning. However, if you frequently wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, this could be an underlying problem. If this happens at least three times a week for at least three months, it could be chronic insomnia, said Dr. Kannan Ramar, a sleep physician at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and past president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Two of the main causes of insomnia are stress and anxiety. If you wake up and look at the clock and then worry about getting rested for work the next day, paying your bills, or experiencing other life stresses, it could activate your sympathetic nervous system, called the fight-or-flight response . The adrenaline level, the so-called stress hormone, rises, increases the heart rate and leads to a state of increased excitement, which makes it particularly difficult to fall asleep again. “You might ask, ‘Is this the same time I woke up last night? Why does this always happen? ‘”Said Dr. Ramar. “These thoughts are not helpful in getting back to sleep.” If you find that you’ve been awake for 25 minutes or more, experts advise you to get up and do some quiet activity that calms your mind – all to suppress the stressful thoughts that were keeping you awake. Gentle stretches or breathing exercises can help, as can meditation, which has been shown in studies to help combat chronic insomnia. You can sit on the couch and knit or read a book or magazine in low light. Experts recommend not reading on smartphones, as the blue light these devices emit can suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that makes us sleepy. However, you can pull out your phone to use a calming app like Calm or Headspace that is designed to help you sleep and meditate. When you finally feel tired, go back to bed and try to doze off. Then, the next day, perform the following sleep hygiene habits to increase your chances of getting a good night’s sleep. If these measures don’t help, a sleep specialist can assess whether you may have a more serious underlying problem, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, that needs medical attention. A sleep clinic could also put you in touch with a cognitive behavioral therapist who could help you identify and treat specific behaviors that could be causing your chronic insomnia. Do you have a health question? Ask well"

"J&J, AstraZeneca may alter COVID vaccines because of blood clots",6390,"Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca PLC, and the University of Oxford are doing early stage research into whether potential modifications to their coronavirus vaccines could reduce or eliminate the risk of rare but serious blood clots, the Wall Street Journal reported. Quoting sources described as being close to the process, the journal said that outside scientists are also joining the effort and that emerging evidence of clot formation raises hopes of identifying the cause. AstraZeneca hopes to update its recording by next year, the Journal said. It is too early to know whether the J&J recording or the AstraZeneca recording can be modified or whether it would make economic sense, the journal wrote. AstraZeneca said it was “working actively with regulators and the scientific community” to learn more about the rare blood clotting events, including information about early detection and treatment. Aside from the scientific hurdles, modifications may require changes in property rights or regulatory approvals. Still, the unprecedented scale and urgency of the adoption of COVID-19 vaccines could accelerate scientific research and legal problems, as the journal said, as does vaccine development. Use of the J&J vaccine, touted for its ease of use, was suspended for 10 days in April while federal health officials looked at reports of several women who developed severe blood clots within two weeks of receiving the vaccine. Authorities later found that the vaccine’s benefits outweighed its risks. Almost 13 million J&J shots were administered. Also on the news: The Tennessee state government on Monday fired its chief vaccination officer, making it the last of around two dozen states to lose years of institutional knowledge about vaccines amid the coronavirus pandemic. ►Malaysia closed a mass vaccination center Tuesday after more than 200 medical staff and volunteers tested positive for the coronavirus. ►Utah Governor Spencer Cox apologized Monday after his administration discovered last week that a state agency incorrectly stated that 70% of the state’s residents had received a dose.

Nearly 1 million people in France set vaccine appointments in a single day under pressure to save the summer vacation and save the French economy. An app that centralizes France’s vaccine appointments, Doctolib, announced Tuesday that 926,000 people had scheduled appointments on Monday, a daily record since the country’s introduction of coronavirus vaccines in December. 65% of the new hires were younger than 35 years. Infections are on the rise in France, which is fueling discussions that President Emmanuel Macron could announce vaccination requirements – and new demand for appointments. About 41% of the French population are fully vaccinated. The Food and Drug Administration warns of a possible link between this Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the autoimmune disease known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. In a statement, the agency said the data suggest “a link” between the vaccine and a higher risk of disease, but not enough “to establish a causal link”. Approximately 12.8 million doses of the J&J shot were administered. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on their website that people with Guillain-Barré Syndrome can be vaccinated against COVID-19 and that no cases of the disease have been reported in clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. One case has been reported in J&J studies, the CDC said. The death toll from a catastrophic fire that broke out the day before in a coronavirus hospital ward in southern Iraq rose to 64 on Tuesday, Iraqi medical officials said. Two health officials said more than 100 people were also injured in the fire that set al-Hussein Teaching Hospital’s coronavirus ward in Nasiriyah city on Monday. Tortured relatives were still searching for traces of their loved ones Tuesday morning, searching the debris of charred blankets and belongings in the burned remains of the station. A blackened skull of a deceased patient from the ward was found. Many cried openly, their tears colored with anger, blaming both the provincial government of Dhi Qar, where Nasiriyah is based, and the federal government in Baghdad for years of mismanagement and neglect. “The whole state system collapsed, and who paid the price for it? The people in here. These people paid the price, “said Haidar al-Askari, who was at the location of the fire. Overnight, firefighters and rescuers – many only with flashlights and blankets to put out small fires that are still indulging in places – desperately searched the station in the dark. As dawn came, sheet-covered corpses were laid on the floor in front of the hospital. Officials previously said the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit but did not provide any further details. Another official said the fire started when an oxygen cylinder exploded. The officers spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to speak to journalists. – Associated press In the past seven days, new COVID-19 cases in the US were up 97.4% from the previous week, with 47 states now reporting an increase in infections, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"Covid-19 News: Variants, Vaccines, and Updates on Restrictions",38689,"Checking ticket holders’ temperatures outside the Duchess Theater in London on Saturday.Credit…Jeremie Souteyrat for The New York Times LONDON — Most remaining coronavirus restrictions in England will be lifted starting July 19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday, a long-awaited milestone some critics have called reckless, meaning nightclubs will reopen and social gatherings, weddings, funerals and sporting events can take place without limits. Though Mr. Johnson said they would “expect” people to wear face coverings in public transportation and other confined spaces with strangers, they will not be mandatory and social-distancing requirements will end in most places. The government will no longer instruct nonessential employees to work from home and customers do not have to legally leave contact details when entering pubs and restaurants. But they urged nightclubs and other venues with large crowds to use the National Health Service’s Covid passes at entry points, to check vaccination status as a matter of “social responsibility.” However, legal restrictions on international travel will remain, including a color-coded traffic-light system for countries depending on their caseload and entry rules requiring proof of vaccination or negative coronavirus tests. Also starting July 19, the government has said, travelers fully vaccinated with a N.H.S.-administered vaccine returning to England from countries designated to be in the “amber” category will no longer have to quarantine. Mr. Johnson said there was no “easy answer” on the best date to reopen the economy, but that reopening in the colder months would allow the virus to acquire a greater natural advantage. “We know we’re going to see more hospitalizations and more deaths from Covid.” he said. With upcoming school holidays acting as a firebreak, “now is the right moment to proceed.” But proceeding with caution was vital, he warned, and the removal of legal limits was not an invitation to have a celebration. “This pandemic is not over,” he said, adding: “We cannot simply revert instantly from Monday, 19 July to life as it was before Covid.” Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also working to reopen on separate, though similar, timelines. Some scientists and health experts have criticized Mr. Johnson’s government for the proposed move. An article in the medical journal The Lancet called the plans “dangerous and premature” as the Delta variant has driven a third wave of the virus in recent weeks. Studies suggest that vaccines remain effective against the Delta variant. While the increases in cases were mirroring the rise during Britain’s second wave last fall, deaths and hospitalizations remained relatively low, though they are rising, officials said. Last week, Britain reported a daily average of 31,116 new infections, and cases have risen by 113 percent compared with that figure two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database. There was an average of 29 deaths per day over the past week, a 64 percent increase. Officials have predicted that new cases could rise to up to 100,000 a day when the rules are relaxed, and Mr. Johnson said they would not rule out imposing restrictions in the future if, for example, other variants emerged. “We will not hesitate to use the means we have at our disposal.” The government had already delayed the reopening by a month in an attempt to vaccinate more of the population. That delay, said Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, had helped reduce pressure on the health care system and appealed for people to continue getting their vaccines. As of Saturday, about 87 percent of adults in Britain had received at least one vaccine dose, and officials have said that they will accelerate plans to administer second doses for those under 40. A tray holding Pfizer coronavirus vaccines at a vaccination event in May hosted by the Health Pediatrics of the University of Miami in in Florida.Credit…Saul Martinez for The New York Times Representatives of Pfizer are expected to meet with top U.S. scientists on Monday to make a case for eventual federal authorization of coronavirus vaccine booster shots, even as top health officials say the extra doses are not necessary at this time, according to two White House officials. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced last week that they were developing a version of their coronavirus vaccine that targets Delta, a highly contagious variant, and reported promising results from studies of people who received a third dose of the original vaccine. The companies said in a news release that booster doses may be needed to fend off virus variants. The data are not yet published or peer-reviewed, but the companies said that they would submit results to the Food and Drug Administration for eventual authorization of booster shots — an announcement that caught the Biden administration by surprise. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, later told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that the Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, called him to apologize for not giving Dr. Fauci a “heads up” about the recommendation. In an unusual joint statement issued Thursday evening, hours after the Pfizer announcement, the F.D.A. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pushed back. “Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,” the statement said, adding, “We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.” The clash between the companies and the Biden administration, however muted, prompted Biden officials to invite Pfizer representatives to present their data to the White House, according to one of the officials, both of whom are not authorized to speak publicly. The attendees will be a who’s who of government doctors: Dr. Fauci; Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health; Dr. Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General; Dr. Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary for health; Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting F.D.A commissioner; and Dr. David Kessler, a former F.D.A. commissioner who is heading the Biden administration’s vaccine distribution effort, among others. Officials from Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dr. Fauci said Sunday that there was no evidence at this point that booster shots were needed for either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which require two doses, or the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine. “Right now, given the data and the information we have, we do not need to give people a third shot, a boost,” Dr. Fauci said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” though he added, “There are studies being done now ongoing as we speak about looking at the feasibility about if and when we should be boosting people.” At least one outside infectious disease expert, Dr. Carlos Del Rio of Emory University, criticized Pfizer-BioNTech for creating confusion and staging a “publicity stunt.” He also complained about Monday’s meeting being conducted in private instead of by the C.D.C.’s advisory committee on vaccine practices, known as A.C.I.P., which will ultimately make a recommendation on whether booster shots are necessary. “I want to see the data and I think they should present it in an A.C.I.P. session,” Dr. Del Rio said, adding, “It’s very inappropriate of the company to, first of all, announce that we’re doing this, second to say we need a booster where there’s no evidence for that.” Since the onset of the pandemic, Pfizer-BioNTech have pursued a “get to market first” strategy in manufacturing and marketing their coronavirus vaccine. The companies did not take federal money or participate in Operation Warp Speed, former President Donald J. Trump’s fast-track vaccine initiative. They were the not only the first to win F.D.A. authorization for their coronavirus vaccine, the first to use novel mRNA technology, but also the first to gain authorization for their vaccine’s use in adolescents. The strategy has “paid off as handsomely as anyone could ask for,” said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities, a research investment bank focused on biotechnology. Slightly more than two-thirds of American adults — 67.6 percent — have had at least one Covid-19 shot, according to the C.D.C. That figure falls short of the Biden administration’s goals; the president had hoped to have 70 percent of adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. Still, the national vaccination campaign has made clear that the vaccine succeeds at preventing disease, and studies suggest that vaccines remain effective against the Delta variant. Outbreaks are occurring in areas with low rates of vaccination, and the national caseload has ticked up recently; according to a New York Times database. With so many people still hesitant, persuading people to get booster shots may be tough. “At this point the most important booster we need is to get people vaccinated,” Dr. Del Rio said. World Health Organization officials emphasized on Monday the importance of prioritizing resources for global vaccine production and distribution over the development of boosters in light of the stark gap between vaccination programs in different countries. “It’s not to say one or the other, it’s putting things in a crisis in order,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the W.H.O. Health Emergencies Program, in reference to addressing what the organization calls a two-tier pandemic. Lauren McCarthy contributed reporting.

Blue for The New York Times Throughout the pandemic, wrenching scenes have played out across the United States as doctors found themselves in the unfamiliar position of overtly rationing a treatment. But it was not ventilators, as initially feared: Concerted action largely headed off those shortages. Instead, it was the limited availability of ECMO — which requires expensive equipment similar in concept to a heart-lung machine and specially trained staff who can provide constant monitoring and one-on-one nursing — that forced stark choices among patients. “Patients died because they could not get ECMO,” said Dr. Lena M. Napolitano, co-director of the Surgical Critical Care Unit at the University of Michigan. This spring, she was overwhelmed with requests to accept patients considered good candidates for ECMO. “We could not accommodate all of them,” she said. Doctors tried to select individuals most likely to benefit from ECMO, a last-resort treatment that can mechanically substitute for badly damaged lungs. But dozens of interviews with medical staff and patients across the country, and reporting inside five hospitals that provide ECMO, revealed that in the absence of regional sharing systems to ensure fairness and match resources to needs, hospitals and clinicians were left to apply differing criteria, with insurance coverage, geography and even personal appeals having an influence. “It’s unsettling to have to make those kinds of decisions,” said Dr. Ryan Barbaro, a critical care physician in Michigan and head of an international registry of Covid-19 patients who have received ECMO — short for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — about half of whom survived hospitalization. Close to 8,000 patients worldwide have received ECMO to date, including nearly 5,000 in North America. Despite the progress the United States has made against the coronavirus, some doctors are still having to ration ECMO, which is offered in less than 10 percent of hospitals. “It’s something we’re balancing every day,” said Dr. Erik Eddie Suarez, a cardiovascular surgeon at Houston Methodist. If the hospital accepts too many Covid patients for ECMO, he said, “we can’t do cardiac surgery,” because some of those patients also need the treatment. A ferry dock in Sydney, Australia, on Monday. The city entered lockdown more than two weeks ago after an airport limousine driver contracted the virus, which then spread rapidly.Credit…Loren Elliott/Reuters Officials in Sydney, Australia, warned on Monday that the city’s lockdown could be extended as an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus showed no signs of slowing down. The city, Australia’s most populous, entered lockdown more than two weeks ago after an airport limousine driver contracted the virus, which then spread rapidly. On Monday, officials reported 112 new cases, the highest one-day total yet in an outbreak that has grown to 678 cases since it began in mid-June. “We are at an absolutely critical phase of this disease,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of the state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney. Although Ms. Berejiklian did not say whether the lockdown would be lifted on Friday as scheduled, she stressed that it was contingent on minimizing the number of people who were moving about while infectious. “All of us want to get out of this lockdown,” Ms. Berejiklian said. “It’s up to all of us to see that number of exposures in the community go down.” Though Australia has been relatively successful in managing the virus through strict border closures and contact tracing, only about 9 percent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated, and the rapid spread of the Delta variant is a major concern. Studies suggest that vaccines remain effective against the Delta variant. On Monday, citing the outbreak, Sydney officials said that the AstraZeneca vaccine would be made available to people as young as 40. That is a break from national health guidance, which recommends the AstraZeneca shots only for those over 60 because of blood clotting concerns. For younger people, the guidance is to use the Pfizer vaccine. Boxes of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine in Shepardsville.Credit…Pool photo by Timothy D. Easley The Food and Drug Administration is planning to warn that Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine can lead to an increased risk of a rare neurological condition known as Guillain–Barré syndrome, another setback for a vaccine that has largely been sidelined in the United States because of manufacturing problems and a temporary safety pause earlier this year, according to several people familiar with the plans. Although regulators have found that the chances of developing the condition are low, they appear to be three to five times higher among recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine than among the general population in the United States, according to people familiar with the decision. Federal officials have identified roughly 100 suspected cases of Guillain-Barré disease among recipients of the Johnson & Johnson shot through a federal monitoring system that relies on patients and health care providers to report adverse effects of vaccines. The reports are considered preliminary. Most people who develop the condition recover. “It’s not surprising to find these types of adverse events associated with vaccination,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the F.D.A. under President Barack Obama. The data collected so far by the F.D.A., she added, suggested that the vaccine’s benefits “continue to vastly outweigh the risks.” The database reports indicate that symptoms of Guillain-Barré developed within about three weeks of vaccination. One recipient, a 57-year-old man from Delaware who had suffered both a heart attack and a stroke within the last four years, died in early April after he was vaccinated and developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, according to a report filed to the database. The Biden administration is expected to announce the new warning as early as Tuesday. The F.D.A. has concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing severe disease or death from the coronavirus still strongly outweigh the risk, but it plans to include the proviso in fact sheets about the drug for providers and patients. European regulators may soon follow suit. No link has been found between Guillain-Barré syndrome and the coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, the other two federally authorized manufacturers. Those rely on a different technology. Nearly 13 million people in the United States have received Johnson & Johnson’s shot, but 92 percent of Americans who have been fully vaccinated received shots developed by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. Even though it requires only one dose, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine has been marginalized by manufacturing delays and a 10-day pause while investigators studied whether it was linked to a rare but serious blood clotting disorder in women. That investigation also resulted in a warning added to the fact sheet. The new safety concern comes at a precipitous moment in the nation’s fight against Covid-19. The pace of vaccinations has slowed considerably just as a new, more contagious variant called Delta is spreading fast in under-vaccinated areas. Federal health officials are worried that the news could make some people even more hesitant to accept the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, even though well over 100 million people have received those vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost one-third of the nation’s adults remain unvaccinated. The Biden administration has shifted away from relying on mass vaccination sites and is now enlisting community workers in door-to-door campaigns, supplying doses to primary care doctors and expanding mobile clinics in an attempt to convince the unvaccinated to accept shots. Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, speaking on Sunday in Venice. “What happens in any part of the world affects all other countries,” she said.Credit…Andrea Merola/EPA, via Shutterstock Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Sunday that she was concerned that coronavirus variants could derail the global economic recovery and called for an urgent push to vaccinate more people around the world. Her comments, made at the conclusion of a gathering of the finance ministers of the Group of 20 nations, came as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus was driving outbreaks among unvaccinated populations in countries such as Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Portugal. “We are very concerned about the Delta variant and other variants that could emerge and threaten recovery,” Ms. Yellen said. “We are a connected global economy. What happens in any part of the world affects all other countries.” Many cities and countries have started to declare victory against the pandemic, easing restrictions and returning to normal life. But Ms. Yellen warned that the public health crisis was not over. She said that the world’s top economic officials had spent much of the weekend in Venice discussing how they could improve vaccine distribution, with the goal of getting 70 percent of the world inoculated by next year. Ms. Yellen noted that many countries had been successful in financing the purchase of vaccines, but that the logistics of getting them into people’s arms were falling short. “We need to do something more and to be more effective,” she said. The spread of variants has started to dampen optimism about the trajectory of the recovery. Analysts at Capital Economics said last week that they planned to lower their economic growth outlook for the year to below 6 percent. “The divergence across economies is intensifying,” Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the I.M.F., said on Saturday. “Essentially, the world is facing a two-track recovery.” The I.M.F. executive board approved a plan last week to issue $650 billion worth of reserve funds that countries could use to buy vaccines and to finance health care initiatives. A vaccination center in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this month.Credit…Allison Joyce/Getty Images The pandemic has been a cruel blow for thousands of migrant workers in South Asia who are out of work or unable to return to their jobs abroad. Countries like Bangladesh, India and Nepal rely heavily on migrant workers, who send billions of dollars home each year. But over the past year, many have lost their jobs and been forced to return to their native countries. Others still have jobs or have found new ones, but are struggling to make travel arrangements to take up the posts. The lack of Covid-19 vaccines has compounded the problem, with many countries requiring migrant workers to be inoculated to avoid quarantine or sometimes to enter at all. Ajay Sodari, a migrant worker in Kathmandu, Nepal, who needs to be vaccinated before he can start his job in South Korea, said, “I spent four years studying the Korean language, to get selected as a qualified worker in language tests and sign a labor agreement with the company.” He said that he had spent thousands of dollars to meet the employment requirements but that the pandemic had “shattered my dream.” The lack of vaccines has been most acute in Bangladesh and Nepal, both of which planned to source most of their doses from neighboring India until New Delhi stopped vaccine exports this spring to prioritize its own citizens. In Bangladesh and Nepal, only about 3 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database. In Nepal, where inward remittances account for a quarter of gross domestic product, migrant workers were not among the priority groups in initial phases of the vaccination campaign, which favored older adults, frontline health workers, security personnel and government officials. As many as 35,000 migrant workers are stuck in Nepal despite obtaining final work permit approval from the country’s government, according to the Nepal Association of Foreign Employment Agencies. The group says that most countries have stopped recruiting workers from Nepal because they are not vaccinated. In Bangladesh, there are at least 90,000 migrant workers waiting to get vaccinated before they can start their jobs abroad, said Shahidul Alam, director general at the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training, a government agency. Mr. Alam said that Bangladesh was stepping up its vaccination efforts among migrant workers, including with the introduction of an app. “In the last seven days, at least 45,000 workers registered in the app, and the vaccination for them is already started,” he said on Thursday. The workers’ situation is complicated by the fact that their destination countries sometimes require certain vaccines. Neither Saudi Arabia nor Kuwait, two of the most common destinations for Bangladeshi migrant workers, recognize the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine, which Bangladesh now largely relies upon for mass inoculation. To help the stranded workers, the government in Bangladesh is giving them the Pfizer vaccine at seven health facilities in Dhaka, the capital, using some of the 106,000 doses received through the Covax global vaccine-sharing program. Mr. Alam said that the workers would also receive some of the 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine received from the United States this month in partnership with Covax. In India, which has the world’s largest migrant population at nearly 18 million, vaccine shortages are worse in some states than others. The southern state of Kerala is home to the greatest number of migrants in India, with nearly four million Keralites living abroad. Though the state has recently prioritized vaccination for migrants, many said they had been stranded in India for months, unable to return to their jobs and worried their visas would expire. Hanees Babu, 52, has been waiting in Kerala for nearly nine months to return to Kuwait, where he owns a business selling automotive lubricants. He has received both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but that is not necessarily the end of his problems. His vaccine certificate lists the name of the vaccine as Covishield, as it is known in India, which can cause confusion in other countries. The Delhi High Court recently directed the central government to consider including the AstraZeneca name on vaccination certificates to make it easier for people to travel abroad. The Kerala state government is already issuing vaccination certificates that say AstraZeneca, but they have to be applied for separately. Several people seeking to travel abroad said that having two different vaccination certificates made the process more difficult and had led some countries to stop processing visa applications from India completely.

The small archipelago between Sicily and Libya, with a population of half a million, has the world’s highest proportion of fully vaccinated residents at about 70 percent, and about 74 percent have received one dose, according to data compiled by The New York Times. But as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads rapidly across Europe, coronavirus infections are increasing in Malta, with an average of 58 new cases a day, according to the Times data. Chris Fearne, the Maltese health minister, announced the latest measures at a news conference on Friday after new virus cases had doubled every day since the previous Monday, according to Reuters. “We will be the first E.U. country to do so, but we need to protect our society,” he said of the introduction of the restrictions. Starting Wednesday, the Maltese authorities will require vaccination certificates issued 14 days after the final dose. Documents issued by Malta, the European Union or Britain will be recognized. Children ages 5 to 12 must have a negative PCR test for Covid-19, while children under 5 are exempt. All children must be accompanied by a fully vaccinated adult with an authorized vaccine certificate. The government said on Friday that the rise in coronavirus infections showed very clearly that the country’s vaccination efforts were working, as most of the people who tested positive were foreign nationals who had not been inoculated. The restrictions were implemented to err on the side of caution to protect the country’s unvaccinated population, the government said. A vaccination center in Taipei, Taiwan, this month. For much of this year, it looked as if Taiwan’s efforts to acquire BioNTech vaccines had fallen victim to political tensions with China.Credit…Ann Wang/Reuters BioNTech on Monday announced a deal to provide 10 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to Taiwan, easing a serious shortage there and ending months of deadlock stemming from the self-ruling island’s complicated relationship with China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory. The deal is a convoluted one, reflecting the delicate needle that had to be threaded. The vaccines will be purchased, then donated to Taiwan’s government, by two of the island’s most prominent corporate titans — Foxconn, a major assembler of Apple’s iPhones; and TSMC, which makes the cutting-edge chips in Apple’s latest devices — in conjunction with the YongLin Foundation, a charity set up by Foxconn’s founder, Terry Gou. The shots will be sold by Fosun Pharma, the Shanghai company that is BioNTech’s manufacturing and distribution partner for mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. (BioNTech’s partner in other parts of the world, including the United States, is Pfizer.) And officially, the buyer will be Zuellig Pharma, a Swiss-owned company entrusted with the task by Foxconn, TSMC and YongLin. The New York Times reported last month that discussions had taken place about a deal that would include Zuellig, which is already working with Moderna to supply that company’s coronavirus vaccine in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. For much of this year, it looked as if Taiwan’s efforts to acquire vaccines from BioNTech, a German company, had fallen victim to political tensions with China. Taiwanese officials said that they had negotiated with BioNTech for months before unspecified “Chinese intervention” caused the talks to run aground. Officials in Beijing denied this and said that, given BioNTech’s partnership with Fosun, Taiwan should not have been dealing directly with the German drugmaker in the first place. Chinese officials have offered to donate vaccines made by Chinese companies and said that Taiwanese people were welcome to get inoculated in China. But Taiwanese law bars the import of Chinese-made vaccines, and opinion polls show that many people in Taiwan distrust them. So far, the island has administered first vaccine doses to around 15 percent of its 23.5 million residents. Many of those shots were donated by Japan or the United States. Foxconn, TSMC and YongLin sought to reassure the Taiwanese public in a joint statement on Monday, saying that the BioNTech vaccines they were buying would be imported directly from factories in the European Union and would bear the original labeling. The shots are expected to arrive at the end of September at the earliest, the statement said. Mr. Gou of Foxconn wrote on his Facebook page that the government in Beijing had not steered the purchase or interfered in it at all. Taiwanese health officials expressed their gratitude for the deal on Monday. A spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office also praised the agreement, though he added that if the island’s government “had considered the life, health and well-being of Taiwan compatriots, this issue could have been resolved sooner.” Health workers were monitored after receiving a Sinovac vaccine at a hospital in Bangkok in March. Thailand is the latest government to indicate doubts about the immunity provided by the Chinese company’s shots.Credit…Adam Dean for The New York Times Thailand said on Monday that health care workers who had received the coronavirus vaccine made by Sinovac of China would also be inoculated with the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech shots to give them greater protection as concerns grow about more transmissible variants as well as about the waning immunity provided by Sinovac. Anutin Charnvirakul, Thailand’s health minister, said that people vaccinated with one dose of Sinovac should be given the AstraZeneca shot as the second dose three to four weeks later. Those who have already received both shots of the Sinovac vaccine, he said, should receive a booster shot “right away.” “This will build immunity against the virus to a high level more quickly,” Mr. Anutin said at a news conference. Thailand is the latest foreign government to indicate doubts about the immunity provided by the Sinovac vaccine. On Friday, Indonesia said it would offer the Moderna vaccine as a booster to health care workers who had received two doses of the Sinovac shot. Both countries are facing their most serious coronavirus outbreaks of the pandemic, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant that was first detected in India. On Sunday, Thailand reported a record 9,418 new coronavirus infections, a day after it reported a record 91 coronavirus-related deaths. For at least two weeks starting Monday, the capital, Bangkok, and surrounding provinces will be under tight restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, including a curfew and a five-person limit on gatherings. Most medical workers in Thailand were inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine after it was approved in February, with the AstraZeneca vaccine becoming available only recently. Trial results have shown that the Sinovac shot is at least 51 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease, above the threshold set by the World Health Organization, and even more effective at preventing hospitalization and death. But several countries that were among the earliest recipients of the Sinovac vaccine have reported that their health care workers have fallen ill with Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated. On Sunday, the Thai Health Ministry said that out of the 677,348 medical personnel who had received two doses of Sinovac, 618 had become infected, citing data from April to July. One nurse has died and another medical worker is in critical condition. “Breakthrough infections” — infections that happen even in individuals who are fully vaccinated — can happen with any vaccine. But governments are especially concerned when it happens to health care workers, especially at a time when their hospitals are already under strain. On Sunday, Prof. Thiravat Hemachudha, a specialist in clinical, virological, and immunological studies at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said that a study of people who had received two doses of the Sinovac vaccine showed that their level of antibodies, at 70 percent, was “barely efficacious” against the Alpha variant first detected in Britain or against the Delta variant. Professor Thiravat said it was imperative that the Thai government gave frontline medical workers booster shots because they faced higher risks of infection. Thailand is producing the AstraZeneca shots locally, the only country in Southeast Asia to do so. It does not have any Pfizer vaccines on hand but expects to receive a donation of 1.5 million doses from the United States this month. While studies suggest that most Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the Delta variant, which the W.H.O. says is likely to become the dominant form of the virus worldwide in coming months, less is known about the Sinovac vaccine. One of China’s top epidemiologists, Zhong Nanshan, has said that a study of 160 people infected with the Delta variant in the southern city of Guangzhou showed that China’s vaccines, developed by Sinovac and another company, called Sinopharm, were 69 percent effective in preventing infection among close contacts, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. Sinovac has not provided any data. Elsie Chen contributed research. A line, mostly consisting of residents of Iran, waited to receive Covid-19 vaccines in Yerevan, Armenia, on Friday. Armenia’s offer of free vaccines to any foreign visitor has drawn many from neighboring countries.Credit…Lusi Sargsyan/PHOTOLURE, via Associated Press Thousands of Iranians frustrated with the government’s chaotic vaccine rollout and desperate for protection after enduring wave after wave of the coronavirus are flocking by air and land to neighboring Armenia to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Iran is enduring a fifth wave of the pandemic, with Tehran and 143 cities declared high-risk “red” zones and the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus spreading quickly. Over the past two weeks, Iran’s average daily caseload has risen by 63 percent, to nearly 17,000, according to a New York Times database. Only about 2 percent of Iran’s 84 million people have been fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. With U.S.- and British-made vaccines banned by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top leader, the country is waiting for shipments of vaccines made by China and Russia. Across the border in Armenia, a country of three million, there are more vaccine doses than people willing to take them, largely because of widespread conspiracy theories and misinformation. Officials there announced in May that they would provide free vaccines to foreigners without registration. Mobile clinics were set up in the streets to make them easily accessible to tourists and visitors. Iranians don’t need a visa to travel to Armenia, and the drive from the border to the capital, Yerevan, is about seven hours. Based on Iran’s vaccine eligibility chart, Parvin Chamanpira, 53, and her husband calculated that it would be months before they qualified, so they traveled from Tehran to Yerevan last week and received their shots from an ambulance parked on the side of the road. She said it took about five minutes, requiring only a blood pressure check and no paperwork. They will return in a few weeks for their second shots. “This is not an ideal choice for Iranians to be forced to travel and spend a lot of money and be stressed out for getting a vaccine,” Ms. Chamanpira said. “We would not do it if we didn’t have to.” Armenian officials have not said how many foreign nationals have received vaccinations, but the number of flights between Tehran and Yerevan has been increased to meet the demand. Tickets are sold out until late August, travel agents said. Bus tours centered around vaccinations are also booked. Some Iranians are chartering their own buses and vans or driving their own cars across the border, according to several people organizing the trips. In a social media group dedicated to planning vaccination trips to Armenia, Iranians at the border posted videos on Friday showing lines of cars and people stretching for miles, saying the wait was at least 13 hours. Among ordinary Iranians and medical workers facing the surge in cases, anger at the government is mounting. Some prominent physicians have called for the health minister to be prosecuted for his mishandling of the pandemic and the vaccine rollout. “Our only weapon is immediate and fast vaccination of the public,” Dr. Saeedreza Mehrpour, the head of Shariati Hospital in Tehran, said on his Instagram page on Thursday, criticizing the country’s leaders for putting defiant ideology over public health. “I wish we had better relations with the worlds.” President Hassan Rouhani said this month that Iran would expand its vaccine distribution effort in the coming weeks by importing more foreign vaccines and producing domestic ones. So far it has received more than 2.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through Covax, the global vaccine-sharing program. In the meantime, Iranians seeking vaccination have been largely left on their own, including those in higher-risk groups. Fahimeh Hosseini, 72, a retired banker, said she recently waited for four hours with dozens of other older people outside a clinic in Tehran for a second dose of the vaccine, only to be told there were no more. The clinic told them appointments for a second dose could not be scheduled because there was no predicting when the vaccine would be in stock. “They told us to keep coming back until you get lucky,” she said."
Live Covid-19 Vaccines and Delta Variant News Updates,17775,"July 11, 2021Updated  July 11, 2021, 3:46 p.m. ET July 11, 2021, 3:46 p.m. ETDr. Anthony S. Fauci said on Sunday that federal agencies were still gathering data and studying whether booster shots for Covid would be necessary.Credit…Pool photo by Jim Lo Scalzo Dr. Anthony S. Fauci made the rounds of the morning TV news shows on Sunday, trying to quell confusion over the latest federal pandemic guidance for the start of school in the fall as well as growing questions about the necessity of booster shots. On Sunday, Israel’s health ministry announced that it would begin offering boosters to adults with weakened immune systems who already had two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in light of the rising number of cases there caused by the Delta variant. The news was first reported by Reuters. Asked about the development on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Dr. Fauci emphasized that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was committed to following the science and said that boosters were not recommended “right now,” given that more than 90 percent of Covid-related new hospitalizations were in unvaccinated patients. But he did not rule out the possibility that boosters might eventually be advisable for certain populations. Pfizer and BioNTech announced last week that they were developing a vaccine targeted to the Delta variant and also had promising results from studies of people who received a booster shot. With a third shot, “You get five to 10 times the number of antibodies that you had from the second dose,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration who is now on Pfizer’s board, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” But while Dr. Gottlieb noted that Pfizer and federal agencies would be meeting early in the week to discuss the data on boosters, Dr. Fauci said that additional studies were necessary. “What the pharmaceutical company Pfizer did, they did their own study and said, ‘You know, we think you’re going to need a boost,’” he said on “Face the Nation.” Federal agencies, he added, were doing their own independent research on the booster question. Dr. Fauci’s answers to the questions that continue to dog us, well over a year into the pandemic, reflected his dual role: officially, as President Biden’s chief medical adviser, and unofficially, as the public’s chief medical assuager. On Friday, the C.D.C. released new guidelines for school reopenings that included a laundry list of options about face masks, social distancing and ventilation. But in emphasizing that the top priority should be a return to in-person classroom education, the agency said that not every item had to be fulfilled and that local jurisdictions should issue their own guidance. Dr. Fauci deflected criticism that the C.D.C. appeared to be flip-flopping with its successive guidelines. He noted that the agency responded to data at large but that local districts had to be nimble in responding to their own situations. “If you can’t implement them, you should still do everything you can with testing, with guidelines that would allow people, for example, in lunchrooms when you gather, when you’re sick don’t come to school, do everything you can to keep the in-person classes going,” he said on the ABC program “This Week.” Read moreGraveyard workers taking a rest from burying coronavirus victims at a cemetery in Surabaya, Indonesia, on Friday.Credit…Juni Kriswanto/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In recent days, Indonesia has reported nearly twice as many coronavirus cases as the United States. Malaysia’s per capita caseload is roughly on par with those of Brazil and Iran. And the latest Covid surges in Japan and South Korea have prompted harsh new restrictions on movement there, effective Monday. Across the Asia-Pacific region, the Delta variant is driving new outbreaks in places where transmission was once kept relatively low, but where the pace of vaccination has been too slow to contain the latest outbreaks. One result is that everyday activities are again being restricted, just as they were in the anxious, early days of the pandemic — even as the West edges back to normalcy. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, is a case in point. Its government once hoped that its archipelagic geography and youthful population would spare it a debilitating outbreak. But only about 13 percent of its 270 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and the rise of Delta is pushing its health system to the brink and forcing some patients to hunt for oxygen. On July 3, the government closed mosques, schools, shopping malls and sports facilities on two of Indonesia’s major islands for two weeks. But the daily average of new cases — more than 33,000 as of Sunday — has continued to climb. Officials said on Friday that they would extend the same emergency rules to other islands. Intensive care wards in and around the capital, Jakarta, have been operating at full capacity, and doctors who received the vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac have been falling ill or dying. The government has said it will administer a third dose, of the Moderna vaccine, to about 1.5 million health workers starting this week. In other Southeast Asian countries, too, the percentages of populations that have gotten even one shot are in the single or low double digits. And as variant-driven infections proliferate, some are seeing their worst outbreaks yet. In Myanmar, where health workers have been striking to protest the military’s February coup, cases are sharply rising and schools have been closed until July 23. People in several Malaysian cities are chafing under strict lockdowns as the country reports the region’s highest per capita caseload. Vietnam is restricting movement in its two major cities and scrambling to import vaccines. And a terminal at Thailand’s largest international airport is being converted into a field hospital. Richer countries in the region have more resources to throw at the virus. But they, too, are vulnerable because they have made little progress in their vaccination drives. In Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, less than one person in three has had a shot, according to a New York Times tracker. New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, reported its largest daily increase in cases this year on Sunday, as well as Australia’s first coronavirus-related death this year, a woman in her 90s. Sydney, the state capital, has already been under a stay-at-home lockdown, and the authorities have warned that it could be extended past July 17, when it is set to expire. South Korea reported 1,378 new cases on Saturday, its third consecutive daily record. The government plans to raise restrictions to the highest level in Seoul, the capital, and some neighboring regions as of Monday. Schools will be closed, bars and nightclubs will be shut, and no more than two people will be allowed to meet in public after 6 p.m. And in Japan, Tokyo’s fourth state of emergency will take effect on Monday, less than two weeks before the Summer Olympics begin there. Restaurants, department stores and other businesses will be asked to close early, and organizers of the Summer Games have said they will bar spectators from most events in Tokyo and its surrounding areas. A ceremony marking the Olympic torch’s arrival in the city late last week was held in a nearly empty park. On Saturday, Fukushima Prefecture said that it would also ban spectators from Olympic events because of the surging caseload, reversing a position announced two days earlier by Olympic organizers.

Armenia’s offer of free vaccines to any foreign visitor has drawn many people from neighboring countries.Credit…Lusi Sargsyan/PHOTOLURE, via Associated Press Thousands of Iranians frustrated with the government’s chaotic vaccine rollout and desperate for protection after enduring wave after wave of the coronavirus are flocking by air and land to neighboring Armenia to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Iran is enduring a fifth wave of the pandemic, with Tehran and 143 cities declared high-risk “red” zones and the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus spreading quickly. Over the past two weeks, Iran’s average daily caseload has risen by 62 percent, to more than 16,000, according to a New York Times database. Only about 2 percent of Iran’s 84 million people have been fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. With U.S.- and British-made vaccines banned by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top leader, the country is waiting for shipments of vaccines made by China and Russia. Across the border in Armenia, a country of three million, there are more vaccine doses than people willing to take them, largely because of widespread conspiracy theories and misinformation. Officials there announced in May that they would provide free vaccines to foreigners without registration. Mobile clinics were set up in the streets to make them easily accessible to tourists and visitors. Iranians don’t need a visa to travel to Armenia, and the drive from the border to the capital, Yerevan, is about seven hours. Based on Iran’s vaccine eligibility chart, Parvin Chamanpira, 53, and her husband calculated that it would be months before they qualified, so they traveled from Tehran to Yerevan last week and received their shots from an ambulance parked on the side of the road. She said it took about five minutes, requiring only a blood pressure check and no paperwork. They will return in a few weeks for their second shots. “This is not an ideal choice for Iranians to be forced to travel and spend a lot of money and be stressed out for getting a vaccine,” Ms. Chamanpira said. “We would not do it if we didn’t have to.” Armenian officials have not said how many foreign nationals have received vaccinations, but the number of flights between Tehran and Yerevan has been increased to meet the demand. Tickets are sold out until late August, travel agents said. Bus tours centered around vaccinations are also booked. Some Iranians are chartering their own buses and vans or driving their own cars across the border, according to several people organizing the trips. In a social media group dedicated to planning vaccination trips to Armenia, Iranians at the border posted videos on Friday showing lines of cars and people stretching for miles, saying the wait was at least 13 hours. Among ordinary Iranians and medical workers facing the surge in cases, anger at the government is mounting. Some prominent physicians have called for the health minister to be prosecuted for his mishandling of the pandemic and the vaccine rollout. “Our only weapon is immediate and fast vaccination of the public,” Dr. Saeedreza Mehrpour, the head of Shariati Hospital in Tehran, said on his Instagram page on Thursday, criticizing the country’s leaders for putting defiant ideology over public health. “I wish we had better relations with the worlds.” President Hassan Rouhani said this month that Iran would expand its vaccine distribution effort in the coming weeks by importing more foreign vaccines and producing domestic ones. So far it has received more than 2.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through Covax, the global vaccine-sharing program. In the meantime, Iranians seeking vaccination have been largely left on their own, including those in higher-risk groups. Fahimeh Hosseini, 72, a retired banker, said she recently waited for four hours with dozens of other older people outside a clinic in Tehran for a second dose of the vaccine, only to be told there were no more. The clinic told them appointments for a second dose could not be scheduled because there was no predicting when the vaccine would be in stock. “They told us to keep coming back until you get lucky,” she said. The lack of vaccines has led some Iranians to turn to the black market. One 37-year-old manager of a trade company, who declined to use his name because he had acted illegally, said he was told he was buying the AstraZeneca vaccine but had no way to know if that was true. Iran’s intelligence ministry announced this week that it had made arrests among several networks illegally selling and distributing Covid vaccines. Read moreEmily Robart, a clinical research coordinator at the University of Ohio, demonstrated the Covid-19 breathalyzer test that is currently under review by the F.D.A.Credit…Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Scientists have long been interested in creating portable devices that can quickly and painlessly screen a person for disease simply by taking a whiff of their breath. But delivering on this dream has proved to be a challenge. Different diseases may cause similar breath changes. Diet can affect the chemicals someone exhales, as can smoking and alcohol consumption, potentially complicating disease detection. Still, scientists say, advances in sensor technology and machine learning, combined with new research and investment spurred by the pandemic, mean that the moment for disease-detecting breathalyzers may have finally arrived. “I’ve been working in the area of breath research for almost 20 years now,” said Cristina Davis, an engineer at the University of California, Davis. “And during that time, we’ve seen it progress from a nascent stage to really being something that I think is close to being deployed.” In May, when musicians from dozens of countries descended on Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for the Eurovision Song Contest, they had to pass a breath test before they were allowed onstage. The musicians were asked to exhale into a device the size of a water bottle called the SpiroNose, which analyzed the chemical compounds in their breath to detect signatures of a coronavirus infection. If the results came back negative, the performers were cleared to compete. The SpiroNose, made by the Dutch company Breathomix, is just one of many breath-based coronavirus tests under development across the world. In May, Singapore’s health agency granted provisional authorization to two such tests, made by the domestic companies Breathonix and Silver Factory Technology. And researchers at Ohio State University say they have applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an emergency authorization of their coronavirus breathalyzer. “It’s clear now, I think, that you can detect this disease with a breath test,” said Paul Thomas, a chemist at Loughborough University in England. “This isn’t science fiction.” Read more GLOBAL ROUNDUP Auckland, New Zealand, in June. The country, which closed its borders early in the pandemic, has all but eliminated the coronavirus.Credit…Sylvie Whinray/New Zealand Herald, via Associated Press Strict lockdowns in New Zealand last year appear to have contributed to a recent outbreak in children of respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., a highly contagious, flulike illness whose symptoms include a runny nose, coughing, sneezing and fever. Children in New Zealand were mostly stuck indoors amid lockdowns last autumn, which runs from March to May in the Southern Hemisphere. After the country reopened last winter, health officials say, few of them contracted seasonal viruses and infections, probably because they had been underexposed to germs. In a typical year, New Zealand sees a peak of cases of respiratory infections from June to September. But in 2020, the country experienced “the complete absence of an annual winter influenza epidemic,” with a 99.9 percent reduction in flu cases and a 98 percent reduction in R.S.V., according to a study published in Nature in February. This year, however, the same children have been more vulnerable than usual to those same ailments. Since the start of winter five weeks ago, during which there have been no coronavirus restrictions, children’s wards in New Zealand have seen dozens of patients, many of them infants, battling the sometimes deadly disease, while some elementary schools have reported having as many as half their students absent because of respiratory illnesses. The country has reported 969 cases of R.S.V. in five weeks, compared with an average of 1,743 cases over the entire 29-week winter season in the five years before the pandemic, according to New Zealand’s Institute of Environmental Science and Research. The recent surge has yet to reach a plateau, said Dr. Sue Huang, a virologist at the Institute of Environmental Science and Research and the lead author of the Nature study. “The exponential increase is very sharp,” she said in a statement. “The absence of R.S.V. last winter meant there is a young cohort of children from last year, plus a new cohort this year, who have not been exposed to the seasonal virus.” Doctors around the world have warned of the risk of “immunity debt,” when a decline in the number of viral and bacterial infections during lockdowns is followed by more sickness once restrictions are lifted. In a paper published in May in the journal Infectious Diseases Now, a team of French medical researchers suggested that less exposure to microbial agents could create a lack of “immune stimulation” for susceptible people, particularly in children. “The longer these periods of ‘viral or bacterial low-exposure’ are, the greater the likelihood of future epidemics,” they wrote. New Zealand closed its borders early in the pandemic, unveiling stringent lockdown measures that were lifted last April and May and have allowed the country to all but eliminate coronavirus transmission. No community cases have been reported for more than four months. In other developments around the world: Read more"
Virgin Galactic launch set for Sunday,5663,"Welcome to the space race, billionaire edition. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Galactic, is scheduled to take off into space on Sunday, if the weather and technical controls permit. If the mission is successful, Branson will beat competitor Jeff Bezos, who recently stepped down as CEO of Amazon, by days. Bezos’ own rocket company Blue Origin plans to launch him into space on July 20th. Branson will be launched from Sierra County, New Mexico and Bezos from a desert location north of Van Horn, Texas, which is over 160 km east of El Paso. Here’s what we know about both space travel and its potential impact on commercial space travel. A live stream of the flight from VSS Unity is scheduled to begin on Sunday at 9 a.m. ET. It is broadcast on Virgin Galactic’s website and on social media platforms. TheLas Cruces Sun-News, part of the USA TODAY Network, will also broadcast the stream online. The two space launches will take place in very different spacecraft. Branson will fly Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity, a spacecraft that will take off from the air after being brought to a great altitude by the VMS Eve aircraft. From there, the Unity will fly to the edge of space using rocket power. Branson becomes part of a six-person crew consisting of two pilots and four mission specialists. Meanwhile, Bezos will visit space in a capsule on a rocket. When Blue Origin’s New Shepard launches from West Texas, the crew pod will separate from the missile just three minutes after launch. A minute later, those on board reach apogee – the flight point furthest from Earth. In flight, the capsule will pass the Kármán Line, a 62 mile high boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and space in one flight. That is a higher peak than what Virgin Galactic has achieved so far. In its easy test on May 22nd, pilots Dave Mackay and CJ Sturckow reached an altitude of 55.45 miles. This means that even if Branson flies first, Bezos could still claim to have hit the higher limit. The state space agency NASA regards the limit of space as 80 kilometers above sea level, while many agencies internationally use the Kármán line as the limit. After reaching the apogee, the pilotless Blue Origin capsule returns to Earth with its passengers and parachutes to land near the launch site. The rocket is also supposed to land itself. On board will be Bezos, his brother Mark, Bezos’ guest of honor Wally Funk and a passenger to be named, who won a $ 29.7 million ticket offer at a charity auction in June. Proceeds from the $ 4.8 million high bid will go to Club for the Future, a company-sponsored foundation promoting science, technology, engineering, and math. Neither the VSS Unity nor the New Shepard capsule can reach the speeds required for orbital flight, but rather are aimed at suborbital flights that give passengers a brief opportunity to view the earth from above and experience weightlessness. After taking off from its carrier aircraft, the Unity flies to the edge of space. On its test flight on May 22nd, it reached a speed of March 3rd, or three times the speed of sound. The passengers experience weightlessness for about 4 minutes before sliding back onto the ground. From takeoff to landing, the Bezos flight will reach space in around four minutes. Once there, passengers and crew can take off their seat belts for about three minutes to experience weightlessness before returning to their home planet. Why does Branson go into space? A child’s call helped launch Virgin Galactic. Since Bezos started Blue Origin in 2000 and Branson launched Virgin Galactic in 2004, both companies have had their share of success and operational risk. Both companies have developed new technology to advance the development of spacecraft the way they will both fly. But it wasn’t all smooth. In 2014, an earlier prototype of Virgin Galactic’s rocket plane, the VSS Enterprise, crashed over California’s Mojave Desert during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another. A recent book by New York magazine journalist Nicholas Schmidle revealed that a subsequent test flight in 2019 posed a potentially fatal safety hazard when a seal peeling off a stabilizer attached to the aircraft’s wing. Last December, a test flight was safely canceled after an on-board computer lost contact with a rocket motor. The company’s third successful manned flight took place on May 22nd and took off for the first time from Spaceport America in southern New Mexico, the base of Virgin Galactic’s operations. New Shepard has now flown 15 successful test flights, with the exception of one booster that crashed during a test in 2015. None of his previous tests included passengers. Virgin Galactic said Branson’s flight would “test the private astronaut experience”. The company plans to resume ticket sales for a 90-minute journey soon after Branson’s flight. Approximately 600 reservations have been made for rates up to $ 250,000. Blue Origin is reportedly set to charge $ 200,000. Virgin Galactic hopes to launch commercial flights with full revenue in 2022. “Neither of us will be able to build enough spacecraft to meet demand,” Branson told Reuters. Branson also said he doesn’t expect prices to drop for another decade, and even by then, those looking for a ride-on ticket could pay as much as $ 40,000. However, the business model is not limited to expensive rides. Virgin has contracts with NASA and other agencies to fly research payloads and train Italian Air Force personnel to become astronauts. Virgin is also involved in research and development for supersonic air travel on Earth. Money:Companies to watch as a new, more corporate-centric space age emerges"
TikTok will automate video removals for nudity and violence,2227,"TikTok uses automation to detect and remove many of the videos that violate its guidelines. For the past year, the service has tested and optimized systems to find and remove such content. It will roll out these systems in the US and Canada over the next few weeks. First, the algorithms will look for posts that violate policies regarding minor safety, violence, graphic content, nudity, sex, illegal activity, and regulated goods. When the systems detect a violation, they immediately remove the video and the user who posted it can appeal. Users can still report videos for manual review. Automated reviews are “reserved for categories of content where our technology has the highest level of accuracy,” TikTok said. Only one in 20 of the automatically removed videos was false positive and, according to the company, should have stayed on the platform. Hoping to improve the accuracy of the algorithms, TikTok notes that “claims against the removal of a video have remained consistent”. According to TikTok, automation should give its security staff the freedom to focus on content that requires a more nuanced approach, including videos that feature bullying, harassment, misinformation, and hate speech. Crucially, the systems can reduce the number of potentially disturbing videos that the security team must watch, such as videos depicting extreme violence or child exploitation. For example, Facebook has been accused of not doing enough to protect the well-being and mental health of content moderators who are tasked with reviewing content that is often disruptive. Elsewhere, TikTok is changing the way users are notified when they break rules. The platform now tracks the number, severity and frequency of violations. Users can see details about these in the Account Updates section of their inbox. They can also view information about the consequences of their actions, such as: For example, how long they’re blocked from posting or interacting with other people’s content.

Pfizer booster extends COVID vaccine protection: Latest updates,7715,"A booster of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine greatly expands protection, as a new study by the companies shows as the number of cases in the US has been rising for weeks and the rate of hospital admissions has started to rise. While the companies plan to submit the data to the Food and Drug Administration for approval, neither they nor the government recommend booster injections until their safety and effectiveness can be fully evaluated. Another study published Thursday in the journal Nature found that a single dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines “barely inhibits” the Delta variant, first discovered in India. However, a second dose “produced a neutralizing response” in 95% of people, even if it was slightly less effective than against previous versions of the virus. “On the one hand, we’ve seen the success of our vaccination programs over the past eight months … and on the other, we’re seeing some new and worrying trends,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Thursday. Because the approved vaccines largely protect against hospitalization and death from the Delta variant, this trend has been largely driven in unvaccinated populations, she said. Also on the news: ►Do you need a vaccination certificate for the trip? The answer is no – at least for now. ►All reported coronavirus deaths in Maryland last month consisted of unvaccinated people, as well as most new cases and hospitalizations, the state reported Tuesday. ► Cases have increased over 160% in the past week in Los Angeles County, although vaccinated people continue to be well protected, the Los Angeles Department of Health said. ►Trinity Health, one of the largest Catholic healthcare systems in the United States, requires all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to stop the spread and protect patients, employees, and their communities. Trinity is one of the first hospital groups to require vaccinations. ►Australian authorities are further tightening restrictions in Sydney after reporting 44 new cases in the community, the highest number since a coronavirus outbreak began there last month. The city of more than 5 million people is already in lockdown. ►Arizona hit a coronavirus milestone on Thursday as 50% of its population, or nearly 3.6 million people, received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Today’s numbers: There are more than 33.79 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 606,400 deaths in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. The global total: more than 185.5 million cases and more than 4 million deaths. More than 158.28 million Americans – 47.7% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. What we read: As COVID-19 vaccination rates continue to decline, several states have spent millions of dollars on lottery prizes to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get their vaccination.

While the economy took a big leap forward in June when employers created 850,000 jobs, many companies say they are struggling to find workers. Some employers and Republican lawmakers blame federal unemployment assistance for the shortage, which they believe is preventing people from returning to work. Economists disagree on whether the additional support is holding back job hunting, even if 26 states end the federal hike of $ 300 a week before it officially ends on September 6. What is more evident is that some workers, especially those with low wages, are more picky about their job. They are determined to find better paying and more fulfilling jobs than those they left or lost during the pandemic. “They know they have to go back to work,” says Andrew Stettner of The Century Foundation, a left-wing think tank. “People are looking for the right job that suits their sense of security.” – Charisse Jones and Jessica Menton State health officials said Thursday a third shot of the COVID-19 vaccine was not yet required after a new study found a booster dose of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine greatly extended protection. The companies said they were developing a vaccine that directly targets the Delta variant, and the data showed that a third dose of their vaccine given six months after the second produced neutralizing antibodies to the original virus and beta Variant increased by five to ten times. In a joint statement late Thursday, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasized that people who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster vaccination yet. “The FDA, CDC and NIH are running a science-based, rigorous process to see if or when a refresher might be needed,” the government statement said. “This process takes into account laboratory data, clinical trial data, and cohort data – which may include data from certain pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely solely on that data … We are prepared for booster doses if and when science supports it.” – Karen Weintraub The Iowa Department of Public Health’s pandemic reporting website is no longer updated daily as the state continues to “move on to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to the state memo. State officials explained the changes in a June 24 memo to local health officials. The changes to Coronavirus.Iowa.gov went into effect on Wednesday. All positive and negative tests will continue to be reported, along with demographics such as location, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. The positive case analysis, the hospital stay analysis, the regional medical coordination center dashboard and the special pages for the death analysis are still active. The changes come as the case numbers continue to fluctuate from April 2020, just before the pandemic started and before the coronavirus hit the state. On Wednesday, 85 people were hospitalized in Iowa with COVID-19, an increase from the recent low of 46 on June 24, but a far cry from the November increase that saw more than 1,500 COVID-19 patients on a single Day hospitalized. In March, the Oklahoma State Department of Health adjusted the amount of information previously reported in its daily updates. Oklahoma residents cannot see much of the information previously provided last year; The sex and age of the victims are no longer available, but deaths are still reported with their general whereabouts. – Nick Coltrain, Des Moines Register Black and Latino communities often have low vaccination rates, and the reason is often due to vaccination reluctance. A study by CommuniVax shows that the reason is more nuanced. The medical anthropologists who contributed to the study said in The Conversation that many people in these communities are not “vaccine hesitant” but rather “vaccine disabled”. The people involved in the study stated that they felt excluded from the vaccination due to the lack of access. Challenges included finding transportation, internet access, and general information on how to get the vaccine. Some, according to the study, were ambivalent about the vaccine because they believed the vaccine had the same level of threat as being infected with COVID-19. They thought that either could lead to disease or complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 63.4% of adults received at least one injection, well below President Joe Biden’s July 4 goal of 70%. About 20 percent of Americans either refuse to get vaccinated or, according to the US House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, are unsure. – Steven Vargas Contribution: The Associated Press."
Covid News: Pfizer and BioNTech Are Developing a Vaccine That Targets Delta Variant,44789,"Medical staff prepare a dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in Sant Vicenc de Casteller, north of Barcelona, this month.Credit…Albert Gea/Reuters Pfizer and BioNTech announced on Thursday that they are developing a version of the coronavirus vaccine that targets Delta, a highly contagious variant that has spread to 98 countries. The companies expect to launch clinical trials of the vaccine in August. The Delta variant, first identified in India, is believed to be about 60 percent more contagious than Alpha, the version of the virus that tore through Britain and much of Europe earlier this year, and perhaps twice as contagious as the original coronavirus. The Delta variant is now driving outbreaks among unvaccinated populations in countries like Malaysia, Portugal, Indonesia and Australia. Delta is also now the dominant variant in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week. Until recently, infections in the United States had plateaued at their lowest levels since early in the pandemic. Hospitalizations and deaths related to the virus have continued to decline, but new cases may be rising, although it’s not yet clear to what extent the variant is responsible. A slowing vaccination drive and swift reopenings also are playing roles. In their news release, Pfizer and BioNTech also reported promising results from studies of people who received a third dose of the original vaccine, but the companies did not provide the data. A booster given six months after the second dose of the vaccine increases the potency of antibodies against the original virus and the Beta variant by five to tenfold, the companies claimed. The vaccine makers expect to submit that data to the Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks, a step toward gaining authorization for booster shots. Antibody levels in the blood may decline six months after immunization, the companies said, and booster doses may be needed to fend off variants. But antibodies are only part of the body’s immune response, and independent studies have suggested that immunity induced by full vaccination is likely to remain robust for years, even against variants. A study published in Nature on Thursday found that two doses of the vaccine are highly effective against the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants. Delta is in the spotlight now, but it is a harbinger of variants to come, underscoring the need to vaccinate the world as quickly as possible. Already the Gamma variant, first identified in Brazil, has found a foothold in Washington State, and a more recent variant, Lambda, is on the march in South America. Video transcript Back transcript “This week, the Delta variant is estimated to be the most prevalent variant in the United States, representing over 50 percent of sequenced samples across the country, up from 26 percent from the week ending June 19. And in some parts of the country, the percentage is even higher. For example, in parts of the Midwest and upper mountain states, C.D.C.’s early sequenced data suggest the Delta variant accounts for approximately 80 percent of cases. Although we expected the Delta variant to become the dominant strain in the United States, this rapid rise is troubling. We know that the Delta variant has increased transmissibility and it is currently surging in pockets of the country with low vaccination rates. We also know that our authorized vaccines prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death from the Delta variant and these results have been observed not just here in the United States, but in other countries as well. Of course, widespread vaccination is what will truly turn the corner on this pandemic. Please know if you are not vaccinated, you remain susceptible, especially from the transmissible Delta variant, and are particularly at risk for severe illness.” “If you are an elderly person or if you have a person with an underlying disease, you might want to go the extra mile of protection of wearing a mask if you were indoors in an environment with a high degree of infection in the community and a low level of vaccination.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the more transmissible and lethal variant is spreading rapidly in communities with low vaccination rates.CreditCredit…Bryan Anselm for The New York Times The Delta variant of the coronavirus can evade antibodies that target certain parts of the virus, according to a new study published on Thursday in Nature. The findings provide an explanation for diminished effectiveness of the vaccines against Delta, compared with other variants. The variant, first identified in India, is believed to be about 60 percent more contagious than Alpha, the version of the virus that thrashed Britain and much of Europe earlier this year, and perhaps twice as contagious as the original coronavirus. The Delta variant is now driving outbreaks among unvaccinated populations in countries like Malaysia, Portugal, Indonesia and Australia. Delta is also now the dominant variant in the United States. Infections in the country had plateaued at their lowest levels since early in the pandemic, though the numbers may be rising. Still, hospitalizations and deaths related to the virus have continued a steep plunge. That’s partly because of relatively high vaccination rates: 48 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, and 55 percent have received at least one dose. But the new study found that Delta was barely sensitive to one dose of vaccine, confirming previous research that suggested that the variant can partly evade the immune system — although to a lesser degree than Beta, the variant first identified in South Africa. French researchers tested how well antibodies produced by natural infection and by coronavirus vaccines neutralize the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants, as well as a reference variant similar to the original version of the virus. The researchers looked at blood samples from 103 people who had been infected with the coronavirus. Delta was much less sensitive than Alpha to samples from unvaccinated people in this group, the study found. One dose of vaccine significantly boosted the sensitivity, suggesting that people who have recovered from Covid-19 still need to be vaccinated to fend off some variants. The team also analyzed samples from 59 people after they had received the first and second doses of the AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Blood samples from just 10 percent of people immunized with one dose of the AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were able to neutralize the Delta and Beta variants in laboratory experiments. But a second dose boosted that number to 95 percent. There was no major difference in the levels of antibodies elicited by the two vaccines. “A single dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca was either poorly or not at all efficient against Beta and Delta variants,” the researchers concluded. Data from Israel and Britain broadly support this finding, although those studies suggest that one dose of vaccine is still enough to prevent hospitalization or death from the virus. The Delta variant also did not respond to bamlanivimab, the monoclonal antibody made by Eli Lilly, according to the new study. Fortunately, three other monoclonal antibodies tested in the study retained their effectiveness against the variant. In April, citing the rise of variants resistant to bamlanivimab, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revoked the emergency use authorization for its use as a single treatment in treating Covid-19 patients. Volunteers walked door to door last week, during an outreach campaign to inform residents of an upcoming coronavirus vaccination event in Birmingham, Ala.Credit…Elijah Nouvelage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is now the dominant variant in the United States, accounting for 51.7 percent of infections, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As health officials had expected, the Delta variant has rapidly overtaken Alpha, the variant that spread through the United States this spring. Alpha, first detected in Britain, now makes up just 28.7 percent of infections, according to the C.D.C. Still, overall, the average numbers of new virus cases and deaths across the country, as well as hospitalizations, are significantly down from the devastating peaks during previous national surges. Delta was first detected in India. Research suggests that most vaccines still provide good protection against it and remain highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths. In England, for instance, where the variant now causes almost all infections, case numbers have risen sharply in recent weeks, but hospitalization rates have increased more slowly and remain low. Next week, a final decision will be made about whether to lift most remaining restrictions in England, including mask rules, on July 19. Studies suggest, however, that a single shot of a two-dose regimen provides only weak protection against Delta, and public health experts have been encouraging Americans to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible. As of Wednesday, 67.2 percent of adults in the United States have had at least one vaccine dose, and 58.4 percent are fully vaccinated. Still, vaccination coverage remains highly uneven, both in the United States and globally, and public health experts say Delta poses a serious threat to unvaccinated populations. On Tuesday, President Biden again urged Americans to get their shots, citing concerns about Delta. “It sounds corny, but it’s a patriotic thing to do,” he said. Health experts say the Biden administration may need to take more aggressive action to encourage vaccination, including urging employers and schools to adopt vaccine mandates. As of Wednesday, administering about 0.73 million doses per day on average, about a 78 percent decrease from the peak of 3.38 million reported on April 13, according to federal data. As for the virus itself, the country has been averaging fewer than 15,000 new coronavirus cases a day for nearly a month, the lowest levels since testing became widely available and a fraction of what was reported in January, when the nation routinely identified more than 200,000 cases in a day. In recent days, however, the average number of new cases has started to trend slightly upward nationally, driven largely by localized outbreaks in places with low vaccination rates, including parts of Missouri, Arkansas and Nevada. As the Delta variant has spreads across the globe, the World Health Organization recently reiterated its longstanding guidance that everyone, vaccinated or not, should wear masks as a precaution. In the United States, however, the C.D.C. has not changed its advice that those who are fully vaccinated can skip masks in most situations. U.S. health officials have suggested that the W.H.O.’s blanket suggestion was informed by its global purview, since many countries have had far less access to vaccines than the United States. In New York City, efforts to monitor the spread of the virus have been scaled back, reflecting a steadily low caseload and a sense held by many that the virus is less of a wide threat. More than 51 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, according to city data, though large parts of the city still have lower rates. Coupled with concerns about Delta, some public health experts and elected officials are worried that the city may be pulling back on its surveillance measures too soon. On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that the Biden administration was unlikely to impose new national mitigation measures, even if cases rise. “The states are going to have to make evaluations and local communities are going to have to make evaluations about what’s in their interests,” she said.

The continent is short of vaccines, and the virus is sickening its young people and overwhelming its already fragile health care systems. More than 251,000 new cases were reported in Africa in the week ending July 4, a 20 percent increase from the previous week, according to Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the W.H.O. regional director for Africa. For several weeks now, the continent has been experiencing a brutal wave of infections driven by the more contagious Delta variant, which is increasing hospitalization and fatalities, filling intensive-care beds, depleting oxygen supplies and pushing governments to institute new lockdown measures. Sixteen African countries are reporting a resurgence in infections, with Malawi and Senegal added to the list this week. New case counts are doubling every 18 days, Dr. Moeti said, and have been rising for seven straight weeks. “A few weeks ago, we projected this milestone would be reached shortly, and it brings me no joy to be right,” Dr. Moeti said at a news conference on Thursday. “For Africa, the worst is yet to come,” she warned, adding, “The end to this precipitous rise is still weeks away.” A third wave of the pandemic is ripping through countries mainly in southern and eastern Africa, and one country in North Africa — Tunisia — is experiencing its fourth wave. Namibia, a nation of just over 2.5 million people, has been recording more than 1,000 new cases a day, and several senior government officials have succumbed to the virus. A spike in cases in Zambia has pushed the government to restrict social gatherings and close schools. In Uganda, which was praised for its initial coronavirus response, hospitals have been stretched thin, with some patients racking up huge medical bills. Rwanda restricted movement in its capital late last month, and Kenya instituted partial lockdowns and extended curfew hours in over a dozen counties where the Delta variant was contributing to surges. Many African countries continue to face challenges in detecting and sequencing virus variants, Dr. Moeti said. Testing and tracing remain limited as well: In a continent of 1.3 billion people, just over 54 million Covid-19 tests have been conducted, according to Dr. John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa C.D.C. But the biggest challenge has been vaccination. With just over 53 million doses administered, only about 1 percent of Africa’s population is fully vaccinated. African officials have accused wealthy nations of hoarding vaccine doses while millions of Africans remain vulnerable. Most African countries are dependent on the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative, which has been severely hampered by the Indian government’s decision in April to hold back doses manufactured there for domestic use and restrict exports. As cases surge in Africa, some wealthy nations have begun donating vaccine doses to nations on the continent. And as more supplies come in, health officials are urging African countries to prepare to receive and administer the doses quickly. “Governments and partners can do this,” Dr. Moeti said, “by planning to expand vaccination sites, improving cold chain capacities beyond capital cities, sensitizing communities to boost vaccine confidence and demand, and ensuring operational funding is ready to go when it is needed.” VideoOfficials said the declaration was due to the spread of the Delta variant. Organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, which will begin on July 23, said that they would bar spectators from most events at the Games.CreditCredit…Kazuhiro Nogi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Olympic organizers said on Thursday that they would bar spectators from most events at the Games scheduled to open in two weeks, a decision that followed the declaration of a new state of emergency in Tokyo in response to a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. Officials have long insisted that they can hold the Tokyo Games safely amid a pandemic. Last month, they announced that they would allow domestic spectators at the events despite public fears that the Games could become a petri dish for new variants of the virus. Now, the virus has again wreaked havoc on the planning of Olympic organizers, who gathered in an emergency meeting on Thursday night to decide how to respond to the latest challenge of a pandemic that had already delayed the Games by a year. The announcement came only hours before the Olympic torch was set to begin the last — and long-delayed — leg of its trip through Japan. Officials decided this week that there would be almost no actual running during its two-week perambulation through Tokyo and its suburbs, replacing the marathon with a series of ceremonies that would be closed to the public. Addressing reporters on Thursday night, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga acknowledged the challenge the country faced as the more contagious Delta variant had begun to spread. He warned about the danger of the virus spreading beyond Tokyo as people traveled home for the summer holidays. But at the same time, Mr. Suga pledged to deliver an Olympic Games that would go down in history not as another victim of the pandemic, but as an example of fortitude in the face of adversity. Viewers will be tuning in from around the world, he said, and “I want to transmit to them a message from Tokyo about overcoming hardship with effort and wisdom.” A street market in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, last month.Credit…Joseph Odelyn/Associated Press The assassination of President Jovenel Moïse of Haiti on Wednesday could complicate efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic in the Caribbean nation, which has yet to begin vaccinating its citizens, officials from the World Health Organization warned. Carissa Etienne, the director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of the W.H.O., said her organization had made Haiti a priority in recent weeks as reported cases have surged. “I am hopeful that the arrival of vaccines in the country can start to turn the tide of the pandemic and bring some relief to the Haitian people during these very difficult times,” Dr. Etienne said. “We continue to stand with them now and will redouble our efforts.” Haiti did not experience the kind of surge early in the pandemic that many experts feared could devastate the country, the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. But the pandemic has grown worse in recent weeks, with a rise in reported cases that experts say is almost certainly an undercount, considering the country’s limited testing capacity. Last month, Covid-19 claimed the life of René Sylvestre, the president of Haiti’s Supreme Court — a leading figure who might have helped to establish order in the wake of an assassination that has plunged the country into even deeper political uncertainty. Dr. Etienne’s organization said in an email that while it was too soon to evaluate the impact of the assassination, “further deterioration of the security situation in Haiti could have a negative impact on the work that has been done to curtail Covid-19 infections,” as well as on vaccination plans. VideoPresident Jovenel Moïse of Haiti was killed in an attack at his private residence on the outskirts of the capital, Port-au-Prince.CreditCredit…Andres Martinez Casares/Reuters The organization said that Haiti was also facing challenges from the start of hurricane season and the recent detection of the Alpha and Gamma virus variants on the island. Though “vaccines are expected to arrive shortly” in Haiti, the organization said it did not have a specific delivery date. In June, Dr. Etienne urged the global community to do more to help Haiti cope with rising coronavirus cases and deaths. “The situation we’re seeing in Haiti is a cautionary tale in just how quickly things can change with this virus,” she said. Haiti is an extreme example of the “stark inequities on vaccine access,” Dr. Etienne said. “For every success, there are several countries that have been unable to reach even the most vulnerable in their population.” Across Latin America and the Caribbean, there are millions of people who “still don’t know when they will have a chance to be immunized,” she said. She said the inequitable distribution of vaccines posed practical and moral problems. “If we don’t ensure that countries in the South have the ability to vaccinate as much as countries in the North, this virus will keep circulating in the poorest nations for years to come,” Dr. Etienne said. “Hundreds of millions will remain at risk while the wealthier nations go back to normal. Obviously, this should not happen.” A medical worker tended to patients infected with the coronavirus at Marlinksy Hospital in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday.Credit…Olga Maltseva/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images While highly effective Covid-19 vaccines were developed with unprecedented speed, the search for drugs to treat people infected with the coronavirus has lagged. Researchers hope that drugs already on the market for other diseases might be found to help Covid patients, but the challenge has been to identify the best candidates. In a new article published in Nature on Thursday, an international group of researchers, led by Andrea Ganna of the Institute for Molecular Medicine in Helsinki, reported that when they scoured the genomes of nearly 50,000 people in 19 countries who had Covid-19, they found 13 genetic areas of interest that might focus the search for useful drugs. The study cautioned that the genetic variations, which are inherited, could not themselves be used to predict who might contract Covid or, if infected with the coronavirus, who might become seriously ill. Each of the genetic variations appears to be associated with a minuscule additional risk of infection or severe disease. But even so, a drug for another disease that directs its effects toward a gene variation that also occurs in some Covid patients might also prove to help the Covid patients, the reasoning goes. The cases the researchers studied included people who were hospitalized with severe Covid, people whose electronic health record showed that they had a positive Covid test, and people who simply self-reported that they had had Covid infections. Each genetic area found by the researchers represents small differences in a segment of DNA. The most promising genetic variations, the researchers say, include those in a gene that has been previously reported as a risk factor for lung cancer. The variations result in increased expression of the gene in the lung and are associated with more severe Covid disease. The most severely affected Covid patients have trouble breathing, and some need respirators as the virus affects their lungs. A second genetic variation, also associated with severe disease, is known to reduce the risk of developing autoimmune diseases but to increase the risk of tuberculosis. The third genetic variation increases the risk of infection with the virus. This gene binds to a cell surface protein, ACE2, that the coronavirus uses to hitch itself to cells and enter them. The possible significance of other variations is less clear. Not all are in genes themselves — some are in areas of DNA between genes. The study’s authors caution in their paper that how important the research will be in finding Covid treatments remains to be seen. “Future work will be required to better understand the biological and clinical value of these findings,” the authors wrote. Patients were treated at a special facility for Covid-19 patients in Arequipa, Peru, last month.Credit…Diego Ramos/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Viruses evolve. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is no exception. So the emergence of variants is no surprise, and not every new genetic mutation poses a serious threat. But in recent weeks, a growing drumbeat of news coverage has started to raise alarm about Lambda, a variant first detected in Peru late last year. The variant, initially known as C. 37, has spread rapidly through parts of South America. On June 14, the World Health Organization designated it as a “variant of interest,” meaning, essentially, that experts suspect it could be more dangerous than the original strain. Only a handful of studies have looked at Lambda so far. Here’s what we know: Although more real-world data is needed, there is not yet any evidence that Lambda poses more risk than other circulating variants, such as the Delta variant. “I don’t think there’s any more reason to be concerned than before we knew about this variant,” said Nathaniel Landau, a microbiologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “There’s no reason to think that this is now something worse than Delta.” Gravediggers carrying the coffin of a Covid-19 victim during a burial in São Paulo, Brazil, in May.Credit…Mauricio Lima for The New York Times The world’s known coronavirus death toll passed four million on Thursday, a loss roughly equivalent to the population of Los Angeles, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. It took nine months for the virus to claim one million lives, and the pace has quickened since then. The second million were lost in three and a half months, the third in three months, and the fourth in about two and a half months. The number of daily reported deaths has declined recently. Those are officially reported figures, which are widely believed to undercount pandemic-related deaths. “The numbers may not tell the complete story, and yet they’re still really staggering numbers globally,” said Jennifer B. Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. Ms. Nuzzo said the number of excess deaths reported around the world suggested that “lower-income countries have been much harder hit than their official numbers would suggest.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, called four million dead a tragic milestone on Wednesday, and said the toll was continuing to mount largely because of dangerous versions of the virus and inequities in the distribution of vaccines. “Compounded by fast-moving variants and shocking inequity in vaccination, far too many countries in every region of the world are seeing sharp spikes in cases and hospitalizations,” Dr. Tedros said at a news conference. The official death toll numbers tell only part of the horrifying pandemic story. In many places, people have died without family to comfort them because of rules to prevent the spread of the virus. And many countries were completely overrun. The dead overwhelmed cremation grounds in India in May, where at least 400,000 confirmed deaths have been reported and the actual number is likely higher. That was also the case in funeral homes in the United States, which surpassed 600,000 known deaths last month. The virus has hammered Latin America since the start of the pandemic, and some of those nations have been grappling with their deadliest outbreaks to date. As of Tuesday, seven of the 10 countries with the highest death rates relative to their populations over the past week were in South America, according to data from Johns Hopkins, and the virus has been a destabilizing force in many countries in the region. Government health data in Colombia show that more than 500 people died from the virus each day in June. The country has also gone through weeks of explosive protests over poverty made worse by the pandemic that were sometimes met with a violent police response. A wave of cases in Peru cost many people their livelihoods, and thousands of impoverished people occupied empty stretches of land south of Lima. In Paraguay, which as of Tuesday had the highest number of Covid-19 deaths per capita of any country during the previous week, social networks often resemble obituary pages. Brazil, which recently passed 500,000 official deaths, had the highest number of new cases and deaths of any country in the past week. A recent study found that Covid-19 had led to a significant decrease in life expectancy in Brazil. Several vaccines have proven effective against the coronavirus, including the highly contagious Delta variant, and death rates have dropped sharply in many parts of the world where large numbers of people have been vaccinated, like the United States and much of Europe. But the virus is still running rampant in regions with lower rates of vaccination, like parts of Asia, Africa and South America. Some places with relatively high vaccination rates, like England, are also seeing spikes in cases, though fewer of those cases have been leading to hospitalizations and deaths. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, who works on coronavirus response for the W.H.O., said that there were “more than two dozen countries that have epidemic curves that are almost vertical.” “The virus is showing us right now that it’s thriving,” she said. Wealthy countries and international organizations have pledged billions of dollars to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing initiative, and nations like the United States have promised to supply hundreds of millions of doses. But those numbers pale in comparison with the 11 billion vaccine doses that experts estimate will be needed to rein in the virus around the world. To date, just under 3.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, according to vaccination data from local governments compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Nearly all have been of vaccines that require more than one dose to be fully effective. Country-to-country differences in progress are stark, with some already inoculating most of their adult citizens while others have yet to report administering a single dose.

Within two weeks, he had died of Covid-19. Hours after Cameron Melius, 26, was released from a Virginia jail in October, he was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he died. The coronavirus, the authorities said, was a contributing factor. And in New York City, Juan Cruz, 57, who fell ill with Covid while in jail, was moved from a hospital’s jail ward into its regular unit before dying. None of these deaths have been included in official Covid mortality tolls of the jails where the men had been detained. And these cases are not unique. The New York Times identified dozens of people around the country who died under similar circumstances but were not included in official counts. In some cases, deaths were added to facilities’ virus tolls after The Times brought missing names to the attention of officials. In other cases, people infected with the coronavirus while incarcerated were granted legal releases because of the severity of their illnesses but were not included in the death tallies of the jails where they got sick. Still other inmates’ deaths were left off facilities’ list of virus deaths for reasons that are unexplained. More than 2,700 people are reported to have died of Covid-19 in connection to U.S. prisons, jails and immigration detention centers, but the additional cases raise the prospect that the known toll on incarcerated people falls far short of providing the full picture. Concerns about how coronavirus deaths are documented have emerged throughout the pandemic, including a finding that the toll among nursing home residents in New York State was far higher than known because thousands who died in hospitals had not been included. Public health officials say the prospect of overlooked virus deaths tied to the nation’s prisons, jails and immigration detention centers carries particular risks. It is challenging, the experts say, to prepare prisons for future epidemics without knowing the accurate toll. For now, the publicly known death totals connected to incarceration largely come from the facilities themselves. “You can’t make good public policy if you don’t know what’s actually going on on the ground,” said Sharon Dolovich, director of the Covid Behind Bars Data Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, which tracks coronavirus deaths in American prisons. — Maura Turcotte, Rachel Sherman, Rebecca Griesbach, Ann Hinga Klein, Brendon Derr and Timothy Williams GLOBAL ROUNDUP Wearing face masks in Suva, Fiji, early this month.Credit…Leon Lord/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images As Fiji battles one of the fastest-growing coronavirus outbreaks in the world, the Pacific Island’s Olympic team departed on Thursday for Tokyo on a freight plane. Their fellow passengers? A shipment of frozen fish. The coronavirus outbreak had thwarted plans to get the athletes to Japan on regular planes after almost all passenger flights from the country were suspended until the end of July. Only a select number of repatriation and freight flights have been allowed to depart. The country has been pummeled by the Delta variant of the virus, with ​​an average of 57 daily new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. Just over 6 percent of the population is fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. So arranging travel was a “logistical challenge,” Lorraine Mar, the chief executive of the Fiji Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee, told The Associated Press. The solution: a freight plane hauling mostly frozen seafood, with just enough passenger space for the athletes and other officials. It’s a sharp contrast to other Olympians’ flashier modes of transport: U.S. basketball players Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton may travel to Tokyo in a private plane because of scheduling conflicts, while members of the British Olympian squad departed from Heathrow Airport in London on Tuesday wearing matching tracksuits in their team’s colors. Around midnight local time, about 50 athletes and officials from Fiji, including the country’s men’s and women’s sevens rugby squads, departed on the flight from Nadi, the principal international airport, to Tokyo ahead of the Summer Games. Before boarding, team members spent 96 hours in isolation and took tests 72 hours ahead of their departure, in line with guidelines set by officials in Tokyo. One official with the Fiji Olympic team who tested positive for Covid-19 was withdrawn from the event. Ahead of the team’s departure, the country’s National Olympic Committee posted a video showing masked well-wishers brandishing Fiji’s sky-blue flag as they waved goodbye. The country will compete in six sports, including archery, judo and table tennis. In 2016, 60 years after the country first competed in the Olympics, Fiji won its first medal when the men’s rugby team triumphed at the inaugural Olympic rugby sevens tournament in Rio de Janeiro. In other developments across the world: A medical worker in Munich filled a syringe with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in May. Germany plans to donate its supplies of the vaccine for use in lower-income countries. Credit…Andreas Gebert/Reuters Germany plans to take at least 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, which many of its own people are shunning, and donate them to developing countries, according to a federal health ministry memorandum. “It’s in our own interest to vaccinate the world,” said Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister. For the first time since its national vaccination drive got off to a slow start early this year, Germany now has enough vaccine doses in stock to fill all domestic orders, experts say. The country no longer sets priorities for who may be vaccinated; every adult is eligible. Both the authorities and the German people have shown a clear preference for the two authorized mRNA-based vaccines — those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — over the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, which use viral vectors. More than 70 percent of doses delivered in Germany have been the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was developed in Germany and the United States, compared with just 17 percent for the AstraZeneca shot, developed in Britain and Sweden. German distrust of the British-Swedish vaccine stems from reports of a rare but potentially fatal blood clotting condition in a handful of recipients, mostly young adults. The government briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca shot, and then recommended that it be used only in people 60 or older, for whom the risk of Covid vastly outweighs the risk of the rare clotting condition. There have also been concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine’s effectiveness against the Delta variant. Last week, German health authorities formally recommended that people who received an AstraZeneca shot as their first dose switch to one of the mRNA vaccines for their second. Doctors and nurses have administered at least one vaccine dose to nearly 58 percent of the German population, and 41 percent are fully vaccinated. Now that relatively few people in the country are becoming infected, many people are skipping their second vaccination appointments. To combat that, state governors in Germany have discussed the idea of fining people who sign up for a shot but fail to show up. The health ministry’s memorandum outlining the vaccine donation plans, which was presented to the German cabinet on Wednesday, says that at least 80 percent of the doses will go to Covax, the global vaccine distribution initiative, for use in low- and moderate-income nations. The rest would be earmarked for use in the western Balkan nations — where at least 3 million doses would be sent — and in Namibia, which was a German colony before World War I. More than 4,400 volunteers attended an experimental concert in Paris in May to assess health risks associated with large-scale indoor gatherings. Credit…Christian Hartmann/Reuters If everyone in attendance wears a mask, keeps their hands clean and has recently tested negative for the coronavirus, large concerts can be held safely indoors without requiring social distancing, researchers in Paris said on Thursday, based on an experiment they ran in May. The Paris Public Hospitals, which led the experiment, gathered 6,678 volunteers and divided them randomly into two groups: about two-thirds of the volunteers attended a special concert conducted for the experiment at the Accor Arena, and the rest did not. Half the volunteers had received at least one vaccine dose. All the volunteers were tested a week later, and the results showed no significant difference between the two groups. About 0.2 percent of the concertgoers’ tests came back positive, nearly the same positivity rate as the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris, over the two weeks preceding the event. The researchers said that analysis of saliva samples taken at the concert showed afterward that five of the eight concertgoers who eventually tested positive already had the virus when they arrived at the arena. The results suggest that “participating in a large indoor live concert with no physical distancing” was “not associated with an increased risk of Covid infection,” the Paris Public Hospitals said in a statement. The results were encouraging for French people who are starting to enjoy the complete reopening of public gathering places in their country, after three lengthy lockdowns over the course of the pandemic and a curfew that was imposed in October. Nightclubs, the last sector still subject to restrictions in France, are expected to reopen on Friday after being closed for 15 months. But the concert experiment followed strict sanitary protocols and took other measures that might not be maintained in commercial public settings, including screening the audience and keeping the bars and smoking rooms at the venue closed. The volunteer attendees were all between 18 and 45, and had declared that they had no Covid symptoms, no other significant health conditions and no recent contact with an infected person. Compliance with the facial mask requirement was tracked and evaluated by a continuous video-capture artificial intelligence system. Experimental concerts previously conducted in Barcelona, Spain, in March and Liverpool, England, in May yielded similar conclusions that indoor events held with strict safety measures would not lead to a significant rise in infections. The coronavirus situation in France remains worrisome. Daily new case reports have risen significantly over the past week in 11 regions of the country, including Île-de-France, and the more contagious Delta variant accounted for more than 40 percent of the new cases. Vaccination efforts have begun to stall with just 37.6 percent of the total population fully protected, and the government, fearing a new wave of infections before the end of the summer, is mounting a new push to speed them up again. People ate lunch alone in a Manhattan plaza last month. Feelings of loneliness increased during the pandemic, even as conditions that kept people apart improved.Credit…Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times Many Americans felt socially isolated during the pandemic, cut off from friends and family as they hunkered down and kept their distance to try to protect themselves from infection. But new research released Thursday suggests many people’s sense of isolation increased even as the public health crisis in the United States began to abate, with communities opening up and the economy improving. While the level of social isolation declined during the spring of the pandemic after the initial shock of the crisis subsided, it then increased sharply over the summer months last year, according to researchers at Harvard, Northeastern, Northwestern and Rutgers universities, before leveling off during the fall. People began to feel less disconnected last December through April of this year, but the levels of social isolation measured by the researchers increased again this June. The findings suggest recovery from the pandemic may take a long time and could affect people’s view of their relationships over time. “There were cumulative effects from the social isolation,” said David Lazer, a professor of political science and computer sciences at Northeastern and one of the study authors. To determine social isolation, the researchers asked each person about the number of people they could count on to care for them if they got sick, to lend them money, to talk to about a problem if they were depressed, or to help them find a job. Someone who said they had only one person, or no one they could turn to, in a given category was considered socially isolated. The researchers polled a total of 185,223 individuals over 12 different surveys from April 2020 to June 2021. Even now, with many more people vaccinated against the coronavirus and much more actively engaged in their communities, people may be thinking differently about those they previously relied on for help. “That pause in life may be causing a lot of revisitation in our relationships,” said Dr. Lazer, who pointed to the unusual number of people deciding to leave their jobs as the pandemic ends. “It takes a while to heal the social fabric.” The increase in feelings of isolation even when the most severe restrictions were lifted “is striking,” said Mario L. Small, a professor of sociology at Harvard who was not involved in the study. People may have felt they had fewer people to lean on because they remained physically distant from a broad network of acquaintances and friends, he said, even when the lockdowns had eased. The researchers found people’s isolation increased last summer even though they were seeing people more. “Our findings show that recovering from social isolation is hard and does not simply stem from increased social contact,” the researchers concluded. The researchers also point to a strong association between social isolation, particularly for those people who said they lacked people they could turn to for emotional support, and moderate or severe depression. Many of those hardest hit by the pandemic, with lower incomes and less education, seem slower to improve, Dr. Lazer said. “We definitely do see a separation of fates in respect to socioeconomic status,” he said, with some groups experiencing a longer and more uneven recovery.

"As Delta Spreads, Nevada Sees a Surge",36622,"Members of the Nevada National Guard offering coronavirus vaccines at a mobile clinic on the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Reservation and Colony in May.Credit…Sam Metz/Associated Press As the speed of vaccinations has slowed around the United States, reported coronavirus cases are on the rise in several states, including Nevada, where nearly 40 percent of the adult population has not gotten a shot. Nevada had the third-highest count of new coronavirus cases per capita of any state as of Wednesday, with 14 per 100,000 people, trailing only Missouri (where 45 percent of the population has had at least one shot) and Arkansas (where 42 percent have gotten at least one shot). But Nevada had the highest increase in average number of hospitalizations, which had risen nearly 62 percent over the previous two weeks, to 441. Dr. Fermin Leguen, the district health officer for Nevada’s southern district, which includes Clark County, said that about 95 percent of Covid patients hospitalized in the past three months had not been vaccinated. Both Nevada and Missouri have asked for help from federal “surge response teams” that the White House announced last week to help states with largely unvaccinated populations cope with the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 73 percent of the coronavirus infections in Missouri involve the Delta variant, as do about 40 percent of the cases in Nevada. The C.D.C. now estimates that Delta has become the dominant variant across the United States. Only full vaccination affords significant protection against it. Fifty-three percent of the country’s population has not been fully vaccinated, including many children under 12 who are not eligible. And persuading unvaccinated people to get inoculated is a critical challenge for the government. President Biden this week renewed his call to the nation to get vaccinated — pressing employers to give employees paid time off to get inoculated and to offer vaccines at work — after the country failed to meet his goal of at least partly vaccinating 70 percent of American adults by July 4. For most of the country, the virus has receded. The seven-day average of new reported cases has held steady at about 12,000 a day, the lowest totals since testing became widely available. That is a drastic drop from the worst days of the pandemic last winter, when new cases sometimes averaged more than 250,000 a day, according to a New York Times database. The surge in Nevada has also not come near winter’s levels, but the Times database shows that the seven-day average of cases there is about double what it was a month ago when Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, relaxed most of the state’s coronavirus restrictions. Most of the state’s surge in cases is in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and most of the state’s population. The city rejoiced when tourists were allowed return to the casinos, theaters and other entertainments on the strip without limitations after more than a year of economic stagnation. In a statement last week, Mr. Sisolak connected the state’s rise in cases to the emergence of the Delta variant and the low rate of vaccination in Clark County, where only 39 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. But Brian Labus, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, linked the rise to the relaxation of restrictions. “It’s not necessarily reopening the strip to tourists — it’s that our entire community is open 100 percent,” Dr. Labus said. “It’s not just the resort hotels. It’s every restaurant, store and business in southern Nevada.” California’s State Capitol, in downtown Sacramento, in January.Credit…Philip Cheung for The New York Times The California State Capitol in Sacramento has toughened its mask policy after finding nine recent cases of Covid-19 in the Assembly, including four cases in people who had been fully vaccinated, legislative officials said. The Capitol’s mask mandate is being tightened at a time when the highly contagious Delta variant, with its enhanced capacity to sidestep vaccines, accounts for nearly a third of cases in the state and more than half of cases in the country, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under the new policy, legislators and staff members, regardless of their vaccination status, must wear masks at all times in the Capitol, the Legislative Office Building and district offices. The policy, which went into effect on Tuesday, extends to lawmakers and staff members working in office suites. Under the previous policy, masks had been required only in public areas like hallways and hearing rooms. In addition, the Senate and the Assembly will begin twice weekly Covid testing of employees who are not fully vaccinated, according to memos from administrators in both of the branches. Over the last 10 days, nine Assembly staff members have tested positive, though one of them later tested negative, Assembly officials said. Eight of the cases were confined to one Assembly office, officials said. “We take this very seriously,” Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement. “It’s our job to serve the people and protect our staff, so that’s what we’re doing. The good news is the great majority of our staff is vaccinated.” Erika Contreras, the secretary of the California State Senate, said in a statement that the Senate “does not have any current cases and has a host of protocols in place that we will continue to adhere to.” Ms. Contreras pointed out that even fully vaccinated people can be infected, although they are less likely to suffer the most serious symptoms. Through the end of April, the C.D.C. had received 10,262 reports of such breakthrough infections from 46 states and territories, a number that was very likely “a substantial undercount,” according to the agency’s own report. In May, however, the C.D.C. stopped investigating breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated except in cases of hospitalization or death. Research suggests that full inoculation with the vaccines in use in the United States provides good protection against Delta — and remains highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths. But several studies have shown that while those vaccines used are effective against Delta, they are slightly less so than against most other variants. Researchers are concerned that fully vaccinated people may sometimes pick up asymptomatic infections and unknowingly spread the virus to others.

The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said that vaccines had “severely weakened” the link between infections and hospitalizations and deaths. About 51 percent of adults in Britain are fully vaccinated, according to data compiled from government sources by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. And despite a surge driven by the highly contagious Delta variant that has pushed average new cases past 27,000 a day, hospitalizations are in the hundreds and daily deaths remain in the lower double digits. “The vaccine has been our wall of defense — jab by jab, brick by brick, we have been building a defense against this virus,” Mr. Javid told the House of Commons on Tuesday. Mr. Javid spoke forcefully in support of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s bold experiment to jettison most virus restrictions — including capacity limits, social-distancing rules and mask mandates — even as cases are rising steeply and the highly contagious Delta variant is spreading globally. Mr. Javid said modeling suggested that infections could be as high as 50,000 per day, double the current rate, on July 19, or “Freedom Day,” as it has been dubbed by the British press. After that, Britain could reach 100,000 new cases per day, Mr. Javid said, although he cautioned that virus models are less certain further into the future. Britain reported 27,334 new cases on Monday and 178,128 over the last week, an increase of 53 percent over the previous week. In a speech to the House of Commons on Monday, Mr. Javid also warned that cases could rise, but said the vaccines would mitigate the worst effects of the virus. “There is no risk-free — absolutely risk-free — way to move forward,” Mr. Javid said then. “But we do need to start returning things back towards normal and learning to live with Covid.” A street market in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, last month.Credit…Joseph Odelyn/Associated Press The assassination of President Jovenel Moïse of Haiti on Wednesday could complicate efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic in the Caribbean nation, which has yet to begin vaccinating its citizens, officials from the World Health Organization warned. Carissa Etienne, the director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of the W.H.O., said her organization had made Haiti a priority in recent weeks as reported cases have surged. “I am hopeful that the arrival of vaccines in the country can start to turn the tide of the pandemic and bring some relief to the Haitian people during these very difficult times,” Dr. Etienne said. “We continue to stand with them now and will redouble our efforts.” Haiti did not experience the kind of surge early in the pandemic that many experts feared could devastate the country, the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. But the pandemic has grown worse in recent weeks, with a rise in reported cases that experts say is almost certainly an undercount, considering the country’s limited testing capacity. Last month, Covid-19 claimed the life of René Sylvestre, the president of Haiti’s Supreme Court — a leading figure who might have helped to establish order in the wake of an assassination that has plunged the country into even deeper political uncertainty. Dr. Etienne’s organization said in an email that while it was too soon to evaluate the impact of the assassination, “further deterioration of the security situation in Haiti could have a negative impact on the work that has been done to curtail Covid-19 infections,” as well as on vaccination plans. The organization said that Haiti was also facing challenges from the start of hurricane season and the recent detection of the Alpha and Gamma virus variants on the island. Though “vaccines are expected to arrive shortly” in Haiti, the organization said it did not have a specific delivery date. In June, Dr. Etienne urged the global community to do more to help Haiti cope with rising coronavirus cases and deaths. “The situation we’re seeing in Haiti is a cautionary tale in just how quickly things can change with this virus,” she said. Haiti is an extreme example of the “stark inequities on vaccine access,” Dr. Etienne said. “For every success, there are several countries that have been unable to reach even the most vulnerable in their population.” Across Latin America and the Caribbean, there are millions of people who “still don’t know when they will have a chance to be immunized,” she said. She said the inequitable distribution of vaccines posed practical and moral problems. “If we don’t ensure that countries in the South have the ability to vaccinate as much as countries in the North, this virus will keep circulating in the poorest nations for years to come,” Dr. Etienne said. “Hundreds of millions will remain at risk while the wealthier nations go back to normal. Obviously, this should not happen.” Volunteers walked door to door last week, during an outreach campaign to inform residents of an upcoming coronavirus vaccination event in Birmingham, Ala.Credit…Elijah Nouvelage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is now the dominant variant in the United States, accounting for 51.7 percent of infections, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As health officials had predicted, the Delta variant has rapidly overtaken Alpha, the variant that spread through the United States this spring. Alpha, first detected in Britain, now makes up just 28.7 percent of infections, according to the C.D.C. Still, overall, the average numbers of new virus cases and deaths across the country, as well as hospitalizations, are significantly down from the devastating peaks during previous national surges. Delta was first detected in India. Research suggests that most vaccines still provide good protection against it and remain highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths. In England, for instance, where the variant now causes almost all infections, case numbers have risen sharply in recent weeks, but hospitalization rates have increased more slowly and remain low. Next week, a final decision will be made about whether to lift most remaining restrictions in England, including mask rules, on July 19. Studies suggest, however, that a single shot of a two-dose regimen provides only weak protection against Delta, and public health experts have been encouraging Americans to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible. As of Wednesday, 67.2 percent of adults in the United States have had at least one vaccine dose, and 58.4 percent are fully vaccinated. Still, vaccination coverage remains highly uneven, both in the United States and globally, and public health experts say Delta poses a serious threat to unvaccinated populations. On Tuesday, President Biden again urged Americans to get their shots, citing concerns about Delta. “It sounds corny, but it’s a patriotic thing to do,” he said. Health experts say the Biden administration may need to take more aggressive action to encourage vaccination, including urging employers and schools to adopt vaccine mandates. Despite the spread of the Delta variant, the country has been averaging fewer than 15,000 new coronavirus cases a day for nearly a month, the lowest levels since testing became widely available. In recent days, however, the average number of new cases has started to trend slightly upward nationally, driven largely by localized outbreaks in places with low vaccination rates, including parts of Missouri, Arkansas and Nevada. As the Delta variant has spread, the World Health Organization recently reiterated its longstanding guidance that everyone, vaccinated or not, should wear masks as a precaution. In the United States, however, the C.D.C. has not changed its advice that those who are fully vaccinated can skip masks in most situations. On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that the Biden administration was unlikely to impose new national mitigation measures, even if cases rise. “The states are going to have to make evaluations and local communities are going to have to make evaluations about what’s in their interests,” she said.

By the end of August, they must attest that they are fully vaccinated if they wish to remain employed, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed, wrote in a memo posted to its website on Wednesday. Only employees who cannot get vaccinated because of medical conditions or religious beliefs will receive accommodations. “While some staff may be unhappy with this new requirement, we believe most will appreciate the actions we are taking on our collective behalf,” Mr. Kashkari wrote. The requirement will affect the bank’s 1,100 workers, of which about 82 percent are already fully vaccinated, he wrote. The remaining 18 percent have not disclosed their vaccination plans or don’t plan to get vaccinated. Mr. Kashkari said that the decision had been made out of a preference for face-to-face interactions in the office and that “there is no way for us to bring a critical mass of our staff back into our facilities and maintain social distancing.” The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said that companies can require those returning to offices to be vaccinated. Employers may also ask employees about their vaccination status, according to the Commission’s ruling. Other employers have announced vaccination requirements for their return-to-office plans. Morgan Stanley said last month that it would require vaccination for employees, contingent workers, clients and visitors at the bank’s buildings in New York City and Westchester County, N.Y. An Israeli medical worker preparing a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Tel Aviv on Monday.Credit…Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images As the Delta variant sweeps the world, researchers are tracking how well vaccines protect against it — and getting different answers. In Britain, researchers reported in May that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had an effectiveness of 88 percent protecting against symptomatic disease from Delta. A June study from Scotland concluded that the vaccine was 79 percent effective against the variant. On Saturday, a team of researchers in Canada pegged its effectiveness at 87 percent. And on Monday, Israel’s Ministry of Health announced that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 64 percent against all coronavirus infections, down from about 95 percent in May, before the Delta variant began its climb to near-total dominance in Israel. Although the range of these numbers may seem confusing, vaccine experts say it should be expected, because it’s hard for a single study to accurately pinpoint the effectiveness of a vaccine. “We just have to take everything together as little pieces of a puzzle, and not put too much weight on any one number,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University. In clinical trials, it’s (relatively) easy to measure how well vaccines work. Researchers randomly assign thousands of volunteers to get either a vaccine or a placebo. If the vaccinated group has a lower risk of getting sick, scientists can be confident that it’s the vaccine that protected them. But once vaccines hit the real world, it becomes much harder to measure their effectiveness. Scientists can no longer control who receives a vaccine and who does not. If they compare a group of vaccinated people with a group of unvaccinated people, other differences between the groups could influence their risks of getting sick. It’s possible, for example, that people who choose not to get vaccinated may be more likely to put themselves in situations where they could get exposed to the virus. On the other hand, older people may be more likely to be vaccinated but also have a harder time fending off an aggressive variant. Or an outbreak may hit part of a country where most people are vaccinated, leaving under-vaccinated regions unharmed. One way to rule out these alternative explanations is to compare each vaccinated person in a study with a counterpart who did not get the vaccine. Researchers often go to great lengths to find an unvaccinated match, looking for people who are of a similar age and health. They can even match people within the same neighborhood. “It takes a huge effort,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Health. For its new study, Israel’s Ministry of Health did not go to such great lengths to rule out other factors. “I am afraid that the current Israeli MoH analysis cannot be used to safely assess it, one way or another,” Uri Shalit, a senior lecturer at the Technion — Israel Institute of Technology, wrote on Twitter. Israel’s numbers could also be different because of who is getting tested. Much of the country is vaccinated. During local bursts of new infections, the government requires testing for anyone — symptoms or not — who came into contact with a person diagnosed with Covid-19. In other countries, it’s more common for people to get tested because they’re already feeling sick. This could mean that Israel is spotting more asymptomatic cases in vaccinated people than other places are, bringing their reported effectiveness rate down. Fortunately, all the studies so far agree that most Covid-19 vaccines are very effective at keeping people out of the hospital and have generally protected against the Delta variant. Israel’s Ministry of Health estimated that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is about 93 percent effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization. “Their overall implications are consistent: that protection against severe disease remains very high,” said Naor Bar-Zeev, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Because effectiveness studies are so tricky, it will take more work to determine how big a threat Delta poses to vaccines. Dr. Lipsitch said that studies from more countries would be required. “If there are five studies with one outcome and one study with another, I think one can conclude that the five are probably more likely to be correct than the one,” Dr. Lipsitch said.

Within two weeks, he had died of Covid-19. Hours after Cameron Melius, 26, was released from a Virginia jail in October, he was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he died. The coronavirus, the authorities said, was a contributing factor. And in New York City, Juan Cruz, 57, who fell ill with Covid while in jail, was moved from a hospital’s jail ward into its regular unit before dying. None of these deaths have been included in official Covid mortality tolls of the jails where the men had been detained. And these cases are not unique. The New York Times identified dozens of people around the country who died under similar circumstances but were not included in official counts. In some cases, deaths were added to facilities’ virus tolls after The Times brought missing names to the attention of officials. In other cases, people infected with the coronavirus while incarcerated were granted legal releases because of the severity of their illnesses but were not included in the death tallies of the jails where they got sick. Still other inmates’ deaths were left off facilities’ list of virus deaths for reasons that are unexplained. More than 2,700 people are reported to have died of Covid-19 in connection to U.S. prisons, jails and immigration detention centers, but the additional cases raise the prospect that the known toll on incarcerated people falls far short of providing the full picture. Concerns about how coronavirus deaths are documented have emerged throughout the pandemic, including a finding that the toll among nursing home residents in New York State was far higher than known because thousands who died in hospitals had not been included. Public health officials say the prospect of overlooked virus deaths tied to the nation’s prisons, jails and immigration detention centers carries particular risks. It is challenging, the experts say, to prepare prisons for future epidemics without knowing the accurate toll. For now, the publicly known death totals connected to incarceration largely come from the facilities themselves. “You can’t make good public policy if you don’t know what’s actually going on on the ground,” said Sharon Dolovich, director of the Covid Behind Bars Data Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, which tracks coronavirus deaths in American prisons. — Maura Turcotte, Rachel Sherman, Rebecca Griesbach, Ann Hinga Klein, Brendon Derr and Timothy Williams A health officer directed residents for coronavirus testing in Suva, Fiji, in June. Daily reports of confirmed Covid cases have rocketed upward in recent weeks.Credit…Leon Lord/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Fiji, which got through the first year of the pandemic almost untouched, is now battling one of the fastest-growing Covid-19 outbreaks in the world. The number of new coronavirus cases reported daily in the Pacific island nation of 900,000 people has soared into the hundreds over the past month, after never exceeding single digits before late May. Officials said the outbreak appeared to have begun after a case of the highly contagious Delta variant escaped the country’s isolation facilities. As of Wednesday, the country was averaging 383 new cases a day, or 43 for every 100,000 people, according to a New York Times database. The 636 new cases reported on Wednesday set a record. Thirty-seven of the 39 Covid deaths reported in Fiji throughout the pandemic have occurred since the latest outbreak began. The surge is swamping the country’s ability to cope. Fiji’s largest hospital is now exclusively treating Covid patients, and its mortuary is filled to capacity, the health ministry said on Monday. More than 1,000 Covid patients have been sent home from medical facilities to isolate themselves because the facilities had no space. The government is working to turn a sports arena outside Suva, the capital, into a makeshift clinic. Repeated breaches of local health restrictions have given the virus entry points. More than 1,000 people have been arrested over breaches of a national curfew, and 48 people were arrested in a 24-hour period this week over breaches of mask requirements, according to the police. The government has declined to impose a lockdown to contain the outbreak. About 31 percent of Fijians have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, but fewer than 5 percent are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database. Partial vaccination provides poor protection against the Delta variant. Fiji, which is using the AstraZeneca vaccine, is depending on Australia and New Zealand to supply it with doses, but New Zealand’s medical regulatory body has not yet authorized the AstraZeneca vaccine, complicating the rollout. Instead, New Zealand has provided the country with 40 million New Zealand dollars, or $28 million, worth of aid and support. “We have provided support in the form of P.P.E. and of course the commitment we’ve made around AstraZeneca vaccines, which is what Fiji are using for their rollout,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. James Fong, Fiji’s health secretary, said that some in the country were putting off seeking treatment for Covid symptoms, sometimes with deadly results. “We are also sadly seeing people with severe disease die at home, or on the way to hospital, before our medical teams have a chance to administer what could potentially be lifesaving treatment,” Mr. Fong said.

Coronavirus testing in the city has dropped about 50 percent since April.Credit…Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters New York City has been scaling back its efforts to monitor the spread of the coronavirus, reflecting not only a steadily low caseload, but also a growing sense that the city, along with the entire country, is starting to leave the pandemic behind. But some public health experts and elected officials worry that the de Blasio administration may be pulling back on its surveillance measures too soon, potentially leaving the city ill prepared should more contagious forms of the virus cause new outbreaks. For the last few days, the daily average test positivity rate in New York City has begun to tick up slightly, to nearly 1 percent. Vaccination rates in a number of neighborhoods remain low. And the more contagious Delta variant is now the predominant variant in the city. Last week, the city said that 44 percent of the positive virus cases it had sequenced most recently for variants were of the Delta variety. The variant was first detected in India, where it led to a surge of cases, and has increasingly spread across the United States. That statistic was clouded by the fact that the city’s Pandemic Response Lab had sequenced only 54 cases, a tiny number compared with the 1,500 cases it was sequencing every week in March and April, and the lowest number of cases sequenced since the lab started tracking variants in January.

More than 125 of them have tested positive for the coronavirus. Credit…KPRC, Click2Houston More than 125 children and adults who attended a religious camp in Texas last month have tested positive for the coronavirus, camp officials said this week in a statement that warned that “hundreds more were exposed” at the camp “and hundreds of others were likely exposed when infected people returned home.” “From the beginning of the pandemic, we have sought to love our neighbors by practicing strict safety protocols,” Bruce Wesley, senior pastor for Clear Creek Community Church, wrote on the church’s website. “We are surprised and saddened by this turn of events. Our hearts break for those infected with the virus.” The church is in League City, about 30 miles southeast of Houston. As of early May, masks were “optional in all areas,” according to the church’s camp website. Telephone and email messages sent to the camp on Tuesday evening were not immediately returned. More than 400 people participated in the student ministry camp, according to the statement. The camp also said it had consulted with the Galveston County Health District and canceled services for now, but would resume activities on Sunday. In a statement on Tuesday, Galveston health officials said the Delta variant of the virus had been detected in three test samples linked to “a church camp.” Dr. Philip Keiser, interim head of the Galveston County Local Health Authority, said, “In this outbreak, at least as of now, it appears most of the people who have tested positive are old enough to be vaccinated.” The camp served children in grades six through 12, it said. News of the outbreak in Texas comes during the return of the traditional summer camp season, when day and sleep-away camps are about to welcome children who just completed a school year dramatically altered by Covid-19 health restrictions, and many children are looking for relief from the soaring summer temperatures. In Illinois, 85 teenagers and adults tested positive for the virus after attending a camp that did not check the vaccination records of participants or require masks indoors, the Illinois Department of Public Health said last month. At least 25 workers at a Christian summer camp in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus in June, Public Radio Tulsa reported. Officials across the country have rolled back face-covering and social distancing rules that were put in place more than a year ago, even as new variants of the virus have quickly spread in areas with low vaccination rates. In Galveston, 44 percent of residents have been vaccinated, slightly above the statewide vaccination rate of 41 percent. In guidance for people attending or operating youth camps, the Centers for Disease Control said in late May that “everyone” aged 12 or older should get vaccinated and that camps “should be supportive of campers or staff who choose to wear a mask.” Gravediggers carrying the coffin of a Covid-19 victim during a burial in São Paulo, Brazil, in May.Credit…Mauricio Lima for The New York Times The world’s known coronavirus death toll neared four million on Thursday, a loss roughly equivalent to the population of Los Angeles, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. It took nine months for the virus to claim one million lives, and the pace has quickened since then. The second million were lost in three and a half months, the third in three months, and the fourth in about two and a half months. The number of daily reported deaths has declined recently. The toll as of Thursday morning was 3,999,646. Those are officially reported figures, which are widely believed to undercount pandemic-related deaths. “The numbers may not tell the complete story, and yet they’re still really staggering numbers globally,” said Jennifer B. Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. Ms. Nuzzo said the number of excess deaths reported around the world suggested that “lower-income countries have been much harder hit than their official numbers would suggest.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, called four million dead a tragic milestone on Wednesday, and said the toll was continuing to mount largely because of dangerous versions of the virus and inequities in the distribution of vaccines. “Compounded by fast-moving variants and shocking inequity in vaccination, far too many countries in every region of the world are seeing sharp spikes in cases and hospitalizations,” Dr. Tedros said at a news conference. Death has followed the virus as the pathogen spread across the world. The dead overwhelmed cremation grounds in India in May, where at least 400,000 confirmed deaths have been reported and the actual number is likely higher. That was also the case in funeral homes in the United States, which surpassed 600,000 known deaths last month. The virus has hammered Latin America since the start of the pandemic, and some of those nations have been grappling with their deadliest outbreaks to date. As of Tuesday, seven of the 10 countries with the highest death rates relative to their populations over the past week were in South America, according to data from Johns Hopkins, and the virus has been a destabilizing force in many countries in the region. Government health data in Colombia show that more than 500 people died from the virus each day in June. The country has also gone through weeks of explosive protests over poverty made worse by the pandemic that were sometimes met with a violent police response. A wave of cases in Peru cost many people their livelihoods, and thousands of impoverished people occupied empty stretches of land south of Lima. In Paraguay, which as of Tuesday had the highest number of Covid-19 deaths per capita of any country during the previous week, social networks often resemble obituary pages. Brazil, which recently passed 500,000 official deaths, had the highest number of new cases and deaths of any country in the past week. A recent study found that Covid-19 had led to a significant decrease in life expectancy in Brazil. Several vaccines have proven effective against the coronavirus, including the highly contagious Delta variant, and death rates have dropped sharply in many parts of the world where large numbers of people have been vaccinated, like the United States and much of Europe. But the virus is still running rampant in regions with lower rates of vaccination, like parts of Asia, Africa and South America. Some places with relatively high vaccination rates, like England, are also seeing spikes in cases, though fewer of those cases have been leading to hospitalizations and deaths. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, who works on coronavirus response for the W.H.O., said that there were “more than two dozen countries that have epidemic curves that are almost vertical.” “The virus is showing us right now that it’s thriving,” she said. Wealthy countries and international organizations have pledged billions of dollars to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing initiative, and nations like the United States have promised to supply hundreds of millions of doses. But those numbers pale in comparison with the 11 billion vaccine doses that experts estimate will be needed to rein in the virus around the world. To date, just under 3.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, according to vaccination data from local governments compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Nearly all have been of vaccines that require more than one dose to be fully effective. Country-to-country differences in progress are stark, with some already inoculating most of their adult citizens while others have yet to report administering a single dose."

"Colorado, Oklahoma hold phone campaigns to boost COVID vaccinations",5927,"In most states in the country there is a vaccination delay, even as vaccines continue to become available. The culprit behind this delay? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most vaccination reluctance came from young, rural, and low-income people. Additional data shows that at least 10% of people who have received a dose of an mRNA vaccine have not yet received a second vaccination. But some experts have come up with a solution: researchers found in a study published in May that people recommended to get a flu shot SMS were more likely to be vaccinated, and some states have started using the same strategy to check vaccination rates to increase. Hengchen Dai, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, tested UCLA’s health system text messages and found that the message reminders increased vaccination rates by up to 3.4 percentage points. Oklahoma launched a statewide text message campaign earlier this month to reach out to people across the state with details on how to find an appointment near them. The federal government also launched one in May. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment took a different approach: on Monday, it called residents who had not received the vaccine to remind them to get vaccinated and to give them information about where to get vaccinated should. Various other states have used lotteries and monetary incentives to vaccinate residents. Study author Dr. Mitesh Patel told CNN the lyrics are unlikely to convince a reluctant person to get vaccinated. But “there is probably 10% of people who are just apathetic,” he said. “They’re not against it, but they’re not going to do anything to get it and that 10% could really push us toward herd immunity.” Also on the news: ►The last update from the World Health Organization, reported last week on Tuesday, reflected the lowest COVID death rate in the world since early November 2020, with a total of 57,000 new deaths.

Gwen Levi left prison last year believing it was forever. She volunteered for several criminal law groups and began learning to use a computer. On June 16, about a year after the Justice Department allowed her to serve her sentence for the coronavirus pandemic at home, Levi was arrested again for violating the terms of her home detention, her lawyer Sapna Mirchandani said. Levi took a computer class in Baltimore four days earlier because he believed he had been approved. Officials at her halfway home pinged her ankle monitor and called her several times after realizing that she was not home. But Levi had her phone turned off during class and her ankle monitor didn’t turn off, her lawyer said. She was unavailable for several hours. A report from the Bureau of Prison described the incident as an “escape”. Levi is now in a Washington, DC jail waiting to be transferred to a federal institution where she is expected to serve the remaining four years of her sentence. She is 76. Read more here. – Kristine Phillips, USA TODAY Allegations that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro turned a blind eye to possible corruption on a deal to buy coronavirus vaccines have heightened threats to his presidency, including recommending that he hit him on criminal charges. The allegations have rejuvenated the opposition’s impeachment process and prompted the Brazilian leader’s allies in Congress to weigh the cost of their support. Bolsonaro, targeted by nationwide street protests in recent weeks, has called the Senate committee investigating the government’s COVID-19 response a “national disgrace” aimed at undermining his government. For two months, the national televised hearings largely focused on why his Department of Health was ignoring vaccine purchase opportunities while Bolsonaro tirelessly promoted hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug that rigorous studies have shown to be ineffective in treating COVID-19 Has. Testimony before the Senate committee last week from Luis Ricardo Miranda, head of the Department of Health’s imports, and his brother Luis Miranda, a lawmaker allied with Bolsonaro until recently, fueled the heat even more.

Covid News: U.S. Supreme Court Leaves Federal Moratorium on Evictions Intact,42671,"A Maricopa County constable signing an eviction notice in Phoenix last year.Credit…John Moore/Getty Images The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to lift a moratorium on evictions that had been imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh in the majority. The court gave no reasons for its ruling, which is typical when it acts on emergency applications. But Justice Kavanaugh issued a brief concurring opinion explaining that he had cast his vote reluctantly and had taken account of the impending expiration of the moratorium. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded its existing statutory authority by issuing a nationwide eviction moratorium,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote. “Because the C.D.C. plans to end the moratorium in only a few weeks, on July 31, and because those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds, I vote at this time to deny the application” that had been filed by landlords, real estate companies and trade associations. He added that the agency might not extend the moratorium on its own. “In my view,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote, “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the C.D.C. to extend the moratorium past July 31.” At the beginning of the pandemic, Congress declared a moratorium on evictions, which lapsed last July. The C.D.C. then issued a series of its own moratoriums. “In doing so,” the challengers told the justices, “the C.D.C. shifted the pandemic’s financial burdens from the nation’s 30 to 40 million renters to its 10 to 11 million landlords — most of whom, like applicants, are individuals and small businesses — resulting in over $13 billion in unpaid rent per month.” The total cost to the nation’s landlords, they wrote, could approach $200 billion. The moratorium defers but does not cancel the obligation to pay rent; the challengers wrote that this “massive wealth transfer” would “never be fully undone.” Many renters, they wrote, will be unable to pay what they owe. “In reality,” they wrote, “the eviction moratorium has become an instrument of economic policy rather than of disease control.” In urging the Supreme Court to leave the moratorium in place, the government said that continued vigilance against the spread of the coronavirus was needed and noted that Congress has appropriated tens of billions of dollars to pay for rent arrears. Crowds at Grand Central Market in Los Angeles earlier this month.Credit…Allison Zaucha for The New York Times After World Health Organization officials urged fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks out of concern about the global spread of the Delta variant, New York City and Los Angeles County appear to now be taking slightly diverging approaches. New York and California lifted virtually all coronavirus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings nearly two weeks ago, signs of immense progress after New York City and Los Angeles County suffered devastating waves of the virus. Both states have followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s mask guidance that allowed for fully vaccinated people to go maskless in most situations. (Exceptions remained for health care settings and public transit, among others.) On Monday, though, Los Angeles County said that it strongly recommended that everyone wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status as a precaution against the Delta variant. By contrast, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said on Tuesday that fully vaccinated municipal office employees are no longer required to wear masks or adhere to social-distancing protocol inside their offices. Unvaccinated municipal workers and those who interact with the public must continue to wear masks. “We will make adjustments when we see real, consistent evidence, but so far, the data is telling us, in fact, things keep moving in the right direction,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference. Public health experts generally agree that getting vaccinated offers the best protection against any type of the virus, and that the Delta variant is unlikely to pose much risk to people who have been fully vaccinated. As of Monday, Los Angeles County had a daily average of three new virus cases per 100,000 people over the past week, while New York City had a daily average of two per 100,000 over the same time period, according to a New York Times database. In Los Angeles County, where 50 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, the Delta variant accounted for nearly half of all cases sequenced in the week ending June 12, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said on Monday. “Until we better understand how and to who the Delta variant is spreading, everyone should focus on maximum protection with minimum interruption to routine as all businesses operate without other restrictions,” county officials said in a statement, noting that social distancing and capacity limits are not required. When the C.D.C. issued its mask guidance on May 13, New York State adopted it within a few days, though New York City’s health commissioner still recommended residents wear masks indoors. As of Tuesday morning, about 60 percent of the city’s adult residents and about 51 percent of all residents have been fully vaccinated, according to the city’s health data. About 80,000 workers were required to return to the office on May 3, after more than a year of remote work, in a signal that the city was beginning to reopen. Still, officials have been cautiously watching the Delta variant, worried about a possible resurgence of cases as restrictions have eased, the city has reopened and New Yorkers scarred from the restrictions and trauma of last year have resumed gathering together. “Right now, we are winning the race against the Delta variant,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding that he did not expect the city to reimpose restrictions or shut down again. As of June 12, the last date for which data is available, 22.7 percent of new cases in the city were identified as the Delta variant, the city’s health data shows, though the rate comes from a relatively low sample of about 100 cases. So far there has been little evidence that fully vaccinated New Yorkers need to take greater precautions because of the Delta variant, said Mitchell Katz, the chief executive of the city’s public hospital system. “Overwhelmingly, the vaccine works against the Delta variant, and so people can keep their masks off if they’ve been fully vaccinated,” Mr. Katz said. In Chicago, the top health official on Tuesday said during a social media question-and-answer session that the city would be sticking with the C.D.C.’s guidance. “Right now, while our outbreak remains in very good control locally, even with the Delta here, there’s not a reason to adjust that guidance,” said Dr. Allison Arwady, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.

Mr. Kim did not clarify whether the incident meant an outbreak of Covid-19 in North Korea, where the authorities until now claim to have found no cases of the virus. But state media reported that the incident was serious enough for Mr. Kim to convene a meeting of the Political Bureau of his ruling Workers’ Party on Tuesday, during which Mr. Kim reshuffled the top party leadership. Senior officials neglected implementing anti-virus measures and had created “a great crisis in ensuring the security of the state and safety of the people,” Mr. Kim said. Mr. Kim mentioned the unspecified incident as an example when he berated party officials for their “ignorance, disability and irresponsibility,” said the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. During the meeting, a detailed report was made on officials accused of neglecting their duties in fighting the pandemic and improving the economic lives of the people, it said. It indicated that there would be some “legal” consequences for the officials. The news agency said that some members of the Politburo and its Presidium, as well as some Workers’ Party secretaries, have been replaced. It did not provide further details. In North Korea, all power is concentrated in the monolithic leadership of Mr. Kim, and he has frequently reshuffled the party and military elites, holding them responsible for policy failures. The North claims officially to be free of Covid-19, although outside experts remain skeptical, citing the country’s public health system and lack of extensive testing. But North Korea, aware of its vulnerability to epidemics, has also enforced some of the harshest measures against the spread of the virus. Last year, it created a buffer zone along the border with China, issuing a shoot-to-kill order to stop unauthorized crossings, according to South Korean and U.S. officials. South Korean lawmakers briefed by their government’s National Intelligence Service last year have said that North Korea executed an official for violating a trade ban imposed to fight the virus. Last July, when a man from South Korea defected to the North, North Korea declared a national emergency for fear he might have brought the virus. But Mr. Kim has also shown confidence that at least his inner circles were virus-free, sometimes presiding over meetings of party elites where no one wore masks. During the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Kim urged party officials to double down on his efforts to build a “self-reliant” economy. As North Korea’s economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, Mr. Kim has acknowledged that his five-year plan for growth had failed and instructed his officials to wage an “arduous march” through difficult economic times.This month, he warned of a looming food shortage. The party meeting on Tuesday “suggests that the situation in the country has worsened beyond the capacity of self-reliance,” said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “Pyongyang may be setting up a domestic political narrative to allow the acceptance of foreign vaccines and pandemic assistance,” he said. “Kim is likely to blame scapegoats for this incident, purging disloyal government officials and replacing them with others considered more capable.” Brazil’s life expectancy rate is likely to decline even more as the coronavirus continues to kill hundreds of people each day.Credit…Rodrigo Paiva/Getty Images The coronavirus has reversed a steady rise in life expectancy in Brazil, which saw an estimated decline of 1.3 years in 2020 and an even more accelerated drop during the first months of 2021, according to a new report published in the Nature Medicine journal. Significant, abrupt declines in mortality rates are rare and Brazil’s represents a major blow given the strides the country had made in improving health outcomes in recent decades, said Marcia Castro, the chair of the Department of Global Health and Population at Harvard University, who was the lead author of the study. “We expect declines of this magnitude when you have a major shock that leads to high mortality, like a war or a pandemic,” she said. More than 514,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Brazil, a death toll surpassed only by that in the United States, which has lost more than 604,000 people. Even so, the United States, which has a considerably larger population, experienced a slightly lower life expectancy drop last year: 1.13 years. The pandemic has continued to steadily worsen in Brazil, where vaccinations have lagged. At least 18 million Brazilians have been infected so far, or at least one in 11 people, and the country is averaging over 68,000 new cases and over 1,600 deaths a day, according to official data. But, as in India, which has the world’s third-largest official death toll, many experts believe the numbers understate the true scope of the country’s epidemic. So far, about a third of Brazil’s population has had at least one shot of a vaccine, according to Our World in Data. Latin America is home to seven of the 10 countries with the highest average daily death toll per person, according to a New York Times database. Colombia recently surpassed 100,000 recorded Covid-19 deaths this week, only the 10th country to pass that milestone. The decline in life expectancy is a jarring setback for Brazil, Latin America’s largest nation, which has spent billions of dollars in recent decades to expand the reach and quality of its universal public health care system. Between 1945 and 2020, life expectancy in Brazil increased from 45.5 years to 76.7 years, an average of about five months per year. The setbacks of the Covid-19 era have reverted the country to 2014 levels, according to the study. Brazil experienced a second wave of coronavirus cases in the first few months of this year that has been far deadlier than the first one, which receded at the end of 2020. Ms. Castro and fellow researchers estimated that the resulting decline in life expectancy for 2021, based on the death toll recorded in the first four months of the year, will be about 1.78 years. States in the Amazon region — including Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima and Mato Grosso — experienced the steepest declines in life expectancy last year. Ms. Castro said states in the northeast, where governors imposed relatively strict quarantine measures, experienced lower drops. Ms. Castro said Brazil’s life expectancy rate is likely to decline even more as the virus continues to kill hundreds of people each day, many of whom are relatively young. The average daily death toll for the past week was 1,644, according to a New York Times tracker. “The decline in 2021 is going to be just horrible,” Ms. Castro said. “We are now losing even younger people.” A drive-through coronavirus testing site in Brisbane, Australia, on Tuesday.Credit…Darren England/EPA, via Shutterstock Countries across the Asia-Pacific region are scrambling to slow the spread of the more infectious Delta variant, reimposing restrictions and stay-at-home orders in a jarring reminder — for societies that had just begun to reopen — that the pandemic is far from over. In Australia, outbreaks of the variant have forced four major cities — Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Darwin — into strict lockdowns. On Monday, the Malaysian government said nationwide stay-at-home orders would be extended indefinitely. And Hong Kong officials banned flights from Britain, where cases of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India, are rising fast. In Bangladesh, soldiers are preparing to patrol the streets to enforce stay-at-home orders, with new cases rapidly approaching their early April peak. “The Delta variant of Covid-19 is dominating,” said Robed Amin, a health ministry spokesman, adding that testing suggested the strain was responsible for more than 60 percent of new cases. The lockdowns and restrictions have deflated hopes across the region, where many countries avoided the worst of the pandemic’s initial spread last year. Now, weary residents are frustrated by what some describe as their countries’ pandemic regression, as other parts of the world edge toward normalcy. Outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s largest city, a restaurant owner, Marcus Low, bemoaned the fourth lockdown of the pandemic. Daily infections in Malaysia peaked in early June, but even after weeks of lockdown, new cases have dipped by only 5 percent over the past two weeks, according to New York Times data. Only 6 percent of the country’s 33 million people are fully vaccinated. “My restaurant is known for its hospitality and shared dishes, the antithesis of social distancing,” Mr. Low said. For his and other small businesses struggling to survive, this lockdown “might be the last straw,” he said. Others blamed slow vaccination drives for a return to restrictions. Public health experts generally agree that getting vaccinated offers the best protection against any type of the virus. Sydney is one of four major Australian cities now in lockdown.Credit…Loren Elliott/Reuters “If we were able to get a really high vaccination rate, that changes the game completely,” said Hassan Vally, an associate professor in epidemiology at La Trobe University in Melbourne. With less than 5 percent of Australia’s population fully vaccinated, he said, “in some ways, where we’re at now is no surprise.” The Delta variant is one of several “variants of concern” identified by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though estimates of its infectiousness differ, the variant could be 50 percent more contagious than the already faster-spreading Alpha variant, which emerged in Britain last year, health officials say. Studies have shown that Covid-19 vaccines are still largely effective against the Delta variant, though protection is significantly lower for those who are partially vaccinated. But the experiences of several countries show that the Delta variant can spread rapidly through the unvaccinated, including children. “Anywhere you carry out vaccination, the disease will be pushed into the unvaccinated population,” said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Countries that have vaccinated relatively high percentages of their populations are moving ahead with reopening plans. In Britain, where the Delta variant now accounts for almost all new cases, officials say they still plan to lift most remaining pandemic restrictions on July 19. New cases there have more than doubled in the past two weeks, but officials believe that the country remains well protected, with nearly half the population fully vaccinated. “While cases are now ticking up, the number of deaths remains mercifully low,” the country’s health secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Monday. In Ireland, Prime Minister Michael Martin announced on Tuesday that the planned return of indoor drinking and dining by July 5 would be delayed because of concerns about the spread of the Delta variant. Once the restrictions are lifted, only patrons who are fully vaccinated or have already recovered from Covid-19 will be allowed to dine inside. Forty-eight percent of Ireland’s residents have received at least one vaccine dose so far, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Experts say that as long as the virus continues to circulate, it can acquire mutations that may present new challenges. In India, where a devastating second wave this spring caused thousands of deaths daily, Maharashtra state has reimposed partial stay-at-home orders in response to the emergence of what has become known locally as “Delta Plus,” described by scientists as a sub-lineage of the Delta variant. Indian health officials have expressed concern that Delta Plus could spread even more easily in a massive population of 1.4 billion, with less than 5 percent fully vaccinated. In an effort to increase vaccine supplies, the country on Tuesday authorized the use of a fourth vaccine, Moderna. “There is the possibility of the third wave,” said Maharashtra’s chief minister, Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray. Global Roundup Video transcript Back transcript I know that globally, there is currently a lot of concern about the Delta variant and W.H.O. is concerned about it, too. Delta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far, has been identified in at least 85 countries and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations. As some countries ease public health and social measures, we’re starting to see increases in transmission around the world. More cases means more hospitalizations, further stretching health workers and health systems, which increases the risk of death. That makes it even more urgent that we use all the tools at our disposal to prevent transmission: the tailored and consistent use of public health and social measures in combination with equitable vaccination. This is why W.H.O. has been saying for at least a year that vaccines must be distributed equitably, to protect health workers and the most vulnerable. World Health Organization officials are urging the public to continue to follow social distancing measures, wear masks and take other precautions over concern about the spread of the Delta variant.CreditCredit…Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPA, via Shutterstock World Health Organization officials, concerned about the Delta variant, have urged even fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and taking other precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the other hand, told fully vaccinated Americans in May that they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or to stay six feet from other people. The agency also eased advice about testing and quarantine after suspected exposure. Asked on Monday about the W.H.O.’s cautions, a C.D.C. spokesman pointed to the existing guidance and gave no indication it would change. The Delta variant, a highly infectious form of the virus that has spread to at least 85 countries since it was first identified in India, is now responsible for one in every five Covid-19 cases across the United States. Its prevalence here has doubled in the past two weeks, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, has called it “the greatest threat” to eliminating the virus in the United States. Public health experts generally agree that getting vaccinated offers the best protection against any type of the virus. Los Angeles County said on Monday that it strongly recommended that everyone wear masks indoors as a precaution against the Delta variant, adding that it accounted for nearly half of all cases sequenced in the county. “Until we better understand how and to who the Delta variant is spreading, everyone should focus on maximum protection with minimum interruption to routine as all businesses operate without other restrictions,” county officials said in a statement. The rise of new variants “makes it even more urgent that we use all the tools at our disposal,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O., said at a news briefing on Friday. Going masked in Lisbon, Portugal. Credit…Patricia De Melo Moreira/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The comments were made in the context of broader statements criticizing inequitable distribution of vaccines and the lack of access to vaccination in many parts of the world. Though fully vaccinated people are largely protected, studies suggest the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy against the Delta variant is slightly lower than against other variants, and significantly lower for individuals who have received only one dose. Britain — where some two-thirds of the population have received at least one dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine and just under half have received two — has seen a sharp rise in cases driven by the variant. And Israel, with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, has partially reimposed mask mandates in response to an uptick in cases. Given how fast-moving the variant is, “the vaccine approach is not enough,” said Eric Feigl-Ding, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. “We’re not at the level of vaccinations where we can release the brakes on everything else.” Other scientists disagreed, saying guidance has to be tailored to local conditions. “The W.H.O. is looking at a world that is largely unvaccinated, so this makes sense,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, adding that parts of the United States might also need different advice. “If I were living in Missouri or Wyoming or Mississippi, places with low vaccination rates,” he said, “I would not be excited about going indoors without wearing a mask — even though I’m vaccinated.” In other news from around the world: At-home rapid coronavirus tests allow you to swab your own nose and get the results in minutes.Credit…Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press Got the sniffles? Worried about that night out in a crowded club? Or maybe you just want to visit grandma but are concerned about her risk, even though you’re vaccinated against the coronavirus. At-home rapid virus tests, which give results in minutes, can be useful and reassuring for both the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Given the availability of vaccines for all people 12 and older in the United States, it may be hard to imagine why anyone would still need a home test. But the coronavirus isn’t going away anytime soon, and a rise in infections this fall among the unvaccinated appears inevitable. In most cases, regular home testing isn’t necessary for someone who is fully vaccinated. The vaccines available in the United States have been shown to be effective against the variants, including Delta. But breakthrough infections, although rare, continue to occur. A home test can offer reassurance to a vaccinated person who has traveled recently or spent time in a crowded bar. It can be used more frequently for families with young children who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination. Here are some scenarios in which a rapid home test may be useful: A sign posted in London’s Heathrow Airport. Visitors from the United States, an amber list country, must quarantine for 10 days. But Britain is allowing an exemption for executives of companies with over 500 employees.Credit…Andy Rain/EPA, via Shutterstock The British government introduced a new exemption to its quarantine rules on Tuesday for business travelers “bringing significant economic benefit” to England, but the move is unlikely to quell frustrations that certain travel routes in and out of Britain remain effectively shut. The exemption has strict criteria and applies only to executives whose work supports at least 500 British jobs. It is much tighter than one that was in place for about six weeks from early December, when travelers needed to support only 50 jobs in Britain. There has been a growing concern that Britain’s strict travel rules could lead the country to miss out on business opportunities as other countries welcome the return of travelers, especially from the United States. Since Britain left the European Union, it is also particularly anxious about not losing lucrative business activity to its neighbors across the English Channel. Parts of Britain, such as the financial and legal district of the City of London, rely heavily on the presence of large multinational corporations. But most people entering the country either must quarantine for 10 days and take coronavirus tests on the second and eighth days or must pay for an additional test to end their self-isolation after five days. Earlier this month, France reopened its borders to vaccinated American tourists, and last week, Germany said all Americans could enter the country. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, met with President Emmanuel Macron of France this week in Paris and opened up a new European Union trading hub on Tuesday. The bank is increasing the number of staff in Paris to 700 by the end of the year, up from 265 before Britain left the European Union. But Mr. Dimon won’t be stopping in Britain, where the company has 19,000 employees and offices in four cities, as he has in past trips to Europe, because of the country’s travel restrictions. Any executives hoping to leave quarantine will have to meet strict requirements, including proving that the work being done in England “has a greater than 50 percent chance of creating or preserving at least 500 U.K.-based jobs” at a company that already has at least 500 employees or at a new British business. Executives have to apply to the government and get written approval, which can take up to five days, before traveling. When the executive isn’t doing business activity, they must self-isolate at all other times, the government said. For more than a year, only a handful of flights each day have operated between New York and London, which used to be one of the world’s busiest travel routes. There are even fewer direct flights from London to other major American cities. The issue of limited flights between New York and London has been raised several times a day, said Emanuel Adam, the executive director in London of BritishAmerican Business, which represents some trans-Atlantic companies. “It’s frustrating to many businesses and scary because they don’t know yet what it will mean down the line,” he said. At the same time, businesses are conscious of the health concerns raised by the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in Britain, he said. And now, restrictions against Britons are tightening; this week, Hong Kong barred all travelers from Britain. In March 2020, President Donald J. Trump banned nearly all non-Americans traveling from Britain, and President Biden has kept the rule in place. There was a small breakthrough at the Group of 7 meetings in Britain earlier this month when the two sides agreed to set up a working group to restart international travel, but likelihood of an agreement for travel to return before the fall is reportedly getting slimmer. “Many other countries have introduced similar exemptions, and it is important the U.K. does not lose out on prospective major investments and new jobs as a result,” a government representative said in a statement. Gas prices are on the rise in the United States. One of the biggest challenges facing policymakers is how they might respond to a persistent rise in inflation.Credit…David Zalubowski/Associated Press The global economy is entering a new stage of the recovery from the pandemic, in which policymakers must prepare for “different but no less formidable challenges,” the Bank of International Settlements said on Tuesday. In its annual economic report, the organization, whose 63 members include the world’s largest central banks, warned that the recovery had so far been “incomplete and uneven” as emerging market economies (aside from China) have lagged behind, the euro area is trailing its peers, and the services sector is recovering more slowly. “While the recovery has been faster and stronger than anyone would have imagined a year ago, we are not out of the woods yet,” Agustín Carstens, the group’s general manager, said. Monetary policy by central banks and fiscal policy by governments need to remain supportive but also be flexible, the report said. One of the biggest challenges facing policymakers is how they might respond to a persistent rise in inflation. Though many, including officials at the Federal Reserve, say they strongly believe that the current increase in prices is temporary, traders and investors are wary of being caught out by a sudden change in this stance that leads to higher interest rates or the end of bond-buying programs. The bank’s report contemplates three paths for the recovery, including one in which inflation exceeds expectations because of fiscal stimulus, particularly in the United States, and consumers spend more of their savings than anticipated. Higher-than-expected inflation would “severely” test central banks, which would find it difficult to avoid market volatility, the report said. But even if the rise in inflation is temporary, “financial market participants could overreact,” the report said. This could lead to disruption in markets because there has been a long period of “aggressive risk taking.” The collapse of the New York hedge fund Archegos Capital Management, which was forced to sell off billions of dollars in equities in March after it could not meet the demands of several banks, costing the banks several billions in losses, “could turn out to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine,” the report said. The fund’s failure raises a question about resilience of nonbank financial firms and how much hidden exposure they have. When the pandemic ends, it will leave “issues that may well be more daunting and enduring,” the report said. One of those will be the need to normalize policy so that central banks and governments have “safety margins” to fight the next crises. “An economy that operates with thin safety margins is vulnerable to both unexpected events and future recessions, which will inevitably come,” the report said. Oregon officials say no one will be turned away from cooling centers because of Covid restrictions, which are expected to end in the state by June 30. Kermic Luster rested in a cooling center at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland on Sunday.Credit…Nathan Howard/Getty Images To help people in the Pacific Northwest escape record-breaking temperatures, local officials have opened cooling centers — and relaxed some Covid-19 restrictions. In Oregon, where temperatures are forecast to reach 113 degrees on Monday, roads have buckled from the extreme heat, and relatively few homes have air-conditioners, state health officials suspended capacity limits at swimming pools, movie theaters and shopping malls on Friday, and said that no one would be turned away from cooling centers because of crowding. The decision follows a sustained decline in new reported coronavirus cases and deaths in the state, and Gov. Kate Brown’s announcement that Oregon would fully open no later than June 30. Nearly 70 percent of adult residents in the state have received at least one vaccine dose, Governor Brown’s benchmark for lifting the state’s remaining restrictions. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington has suspended capacity restrictions at publicly owned or operated cooling centers and those run by nonprofit organizations in his state, though not for “private, for-profit businesses that offer air-conditioned spaces to the general public,” according to a memo released on Friday. More than 70 percent of adults in Washington have received at least one vaccine dose, according to a vaccine tracker maintained by The New York Times. Governor Inslee has said that all restrictions in his state will be lifted no later than June 30 as well. Local officials in the Northwest have tried to balance pandemic safety with the need to provide places for the public to cool off indoors. In Multnomah County, Ore., which includes Portland, people have been asked to wear face masks and maintain social distance at official cooling centers, including several public libraries with extended hours, movie theaters and the Oregon Convention Center, according to Dr. Jennifer Vines, the county health officer. People who come in are not being asked about vaccination status, she said, but officials are offering vaccine shots at the convention center for anyone who needs them. Dr. Vines said that though the coronavirus precautions were important, they were secondary to ensuring that residents can get relief from the record-breaking temperatures. “Cooling people down is the more immediate life safety issue,” she said. This is not the first time officials in Oregon have had to weigh competing health crises during the pandemic. Last September, Portland had the worst air quality of any major city in the world because of wildfire smoke, prompting a rapid shift in public health protocols to address that more immediate threat. “We had been in full-on Covid response, and we suddenly had to do a complete 180 and say, ‘If you have to evacuate, find friends and family — just get inside and close your windows,’” Dr. Vines said on Monday. “It’s a form of triage,” she added. “Working in our favor right now is that we do have a number of people vaccinated. So that makes me feel a little bit better about putting Covid in the back seat, at least for these few days.” Logs ready to be processed at a saw mill in Arkansas. The price of lumber has come down 47 percent since early May.Credit…Karen E. Segrave for The New York Times The cure for high prices is high prices. That’s an old line used in commodity markets, and it helps explain why the great inflation scare of 2021 has eased some in recent weeks. When the price of something soars because demand outstrips supply, it has a way of self-correcting. Buyers, scared off by high prices, find other options, and sellers crank up production to take advantage of a profit opportunity. It is an idea simple enough to be taught in the first few weeks of any introductory economics class, but one with powerful implications for the American economy as it aims for a postpandemic reboot. Several of the key products whose prices soared in the spring have grown less expensive, as producers have increased output and buyers have held tight. This is particularly evident with lumber; as of Friday, its price was down 47 percent from its early-May peak (though still well above historical norms). Sawmills responded to soaring prices by pushing the limits of their capacity. The prices of corn, copper and a variety of other economically important commodities are also down by double-digit percentages since early May. This supports the notion that the inflation the world has been experiencing is transitory — set to ease in the months ahead as the laws of supply and demand take hold. Markets have plenty of flaws and imperfections, but when it comes to allocating scarce goods and sending signals to sellers to make more and buyers to buy less, they work quite well. But just because markets work doesn’t mean they will work instantly. The complexity of the way many of the goods still in short supply are produced, transported and sold means that people in those markets are reluctant to predict the kind of snapback evident in lumber prices. Landlords are trying to entice tenants with sweeping redesigns and new technology that can quickly refashion office space based on needs.Credit…Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Even as life returns to many New York City neighborhoods, its big commercial districts are awash with empty office space. Most workers haven’t yet returned — and it’s unclear if they all will. That uncertainty is terrifying the city’s biggest office landlords, and many of them are going to great lengths to retain and attract tenants. Lower rents or free months in multiyear leases are now de rigueur. But landlords are also trying to entice new and returning tenants with sweeping redesigns and new technology that can quickly refashion office space based on needs. They are dangling upscale new clubs and food halls available largely for tenants. In one building on West 26th Street near the Hudson River, the owners are showing off a 600-square-foot speakeasy tucked away in a corner of the ground floor. Almost one-fifth of the total market for office space in Manhattan is available for rent — a record high, according to CBRE, a real estate services firm. The amount includes roughly 79 million square feet of both unrented space and offices that tenants are trying to sublet. Office landlords largely weathered the pandemic because tenants could not break their leases and had to keep paying rent. But one-third of leases at large Manhattan buildings are set to expire over the next three years, according to CBRE. And as those deals come up for renegotiation, some large companies — which grew comfortable with letting employees work from home during the pandemic — are indicating that they will need significantly less space.

It was held in the echoing marble entranceway of the Public Library just atop Bryant Park, erstwhile home of New York Fashion Week, the stairs outside speckled once more with street-style photographers. Unlike other designers, Mr. Jacobs has eschewed the digital sphere as a way to show his work during the last two seasons and 16 months of relative isolation; he hasn’t played around with ersatz music videos or lonely livestreams, but rather bided his time with his personal Instagram, reconsidered his business, regrouped. This time around there wasn’t any special set. No flashing lights or pyrotechnics. Just clothes, animated by real people, moving through the world for about nine minutes and 32 seconds. Which is not to say they were just any old clothes. They were transition clothes: not between seasons (nominally, this was fall/winter), but between states of mind, and being. Between the cocoons and retreats of the last 16 months — all those comfort clothes for self-soothing we kept nattering on about — and the growing liberation of the present. Metaphor clothes!

Hollywood hopes so as Universal Pictures reports that the ninth installment of the Fast & Furious franchise, “F9: The Fast Saga,” is expected to earn $68 million on 4,179 screens — the largest theater count for a single film since the pandemic closed the movie theater business in March 2020. Internationally, “F9” has already earned over $300 million with a majority of the ticket sales coming from China, where it recently crossed the $200 million mark. The numbers are vindication for Universal, which decided early in the pandemic to postpone its potential blockbuster by an entire year — a delay that some considered excessive at the time. “F9” isn’t the first movie to perform well since movie theaters began reopening their doors. Paramount’s gamble to delay the release of “A Quiet Place 2” also paid off. While the studio sold off some of its other properties including “Coming 2 America,” and the forthcoming “The Tomorrow War” to streamers itching to get their hands on additional content, it held on to “A Quiet Place 2,” the horror sequel, until Memorial Day weekend and has accrued $135 million in the United States and over $200 million worldwide."
Biotech firm Athira Pharma hit by class action lawsuits following image manipulation claims,3842,"Leen Kawas, CEO of Athira Pharma, went on leave earlier this month. (Athira Pharma photo) The lawsuits have started. Less than a week after the CEO of Athira Pharma was given a temporary leave of absence on allegations of altered images in the scientific papers she wrote, three class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of the shareholders for alleged SEC violations. All three lawsuits were filed on Friday alleging that the Bothell, Washington-based company made false and misleading statements in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for its IPO last September, ultimately leading investors to ” invalid research “has led astray.” The company, which is in clinical development of a drug for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s dementia, raised approximately $ 204 million at a stock price of $ 17.00 when it went public. Stock prices have fallen about 40% since CEO Leen Kawas’ leave of absence on June 17, trading at $ 10.37 on Tuesday. On June 17, the news site STAT published an article examining the allegations of image manipulation in Kawas’ articles that first appeared on PubPeer, a service that allows scientists to comment on the integrity of data in scientific articles. A comment first appeared on one paper in 2016 and more recently on three other studies. These are works that Kawas researched as a PhD student at Washington State University, where she completed her PhD in 2011. According to one of the lawsuits, Athira’s SEC filing failed to indicate that Kawas “published research with improperly altered images as a PhD student” and that “as a result, Athira’s intellectual property and product development for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease” was based on invalid research. “ The lawsuits claim that Kawas’ graduate research laid the foundation for Athira’s efforts to develop new treatments. A lawsuit finds that Kawas is identified in a key SEC document as “essential to the development of our innovative translational development strategy.” The lawsuits seek damages from the defendants, who are identified in one lawsuit as Athira Pharma and Kawas. The other two also name Glenna Mileson, CFO of the company and the company’s directors, including Joseph Edelman, founder and CEO of Perceptive Advisors, who led a Series B round for the company, and Tadataka Yamada, chairman and partner of the venture Frazier Healthcare Partner. Yamada is also the former president of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s global health program. Athira hadn’t commented on the lawsuits, according to a spokesman contacted by GeekWire. In a press release on June 17, Yamada said, “Athira is committed to the integrity of scientific research in its mission.” He also said that the company’s primary active ingredient, ATH-1017, “was developed by Athira based on novel data obtained within the Company generated, discovered, developed and patented. The company is convinced of the therapeutic potential of ATH-1017 for the treatment of dementia. “ Last summer, Kawas told GeekWire that the potential of Athira’s technology was “huge”. She founded Athira – formerly known as M3 Biotechnology – together with WSU researchers Joseph Harding, her doctoral advisor, and Jay Wright, with WSU promising initial studies in a 2012 article. According to Athira’s website, neither Harding nor Wright appear to be currently part of the company’s management, board of directors, or clinical and scientific advisory board. They weren’t associated with the company in the IPO registrations either. The WSU is conducting its own investigation into this matter. The lawsuits were filed by the Seattle law firms Tousley Brain Stephens, Rossi Vucinovich and Keller Rohrback. Two of the lawsuits also name the IPO underwriters as defendants: Goldman Sachs and Co., Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Jefferies, and JMP Securities."
"Covid Updates: W.H.O. Urges Masking for the Vaccinated, in Split With C.D.C.",37697,"Dia King, 49, left, and Shakeara Mingo dancing to a local band during a Juneteenth celebration and reopening party in Washington this month.Credit…Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times World Health Organization officials, concerned about the easing of precautions meant to stop the spread of the coronavirus even as the most contagious variant to date has emerged, have urged even fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and to keep taking other measures to prevent infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the other hand, told fully vaccinated Americans in May that they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or to maintain a distance of six feet from other people. The agency also eased advice about testing and quarantine after suspected exposure to the virus. Asked on Monday about the new cautions expressed by the W.H.O. — the world’s largest public health organization — a C.D.C. spokesman pointed to the existing guidance and gave no indication it would change. A highly infectious form of the virus, called the Delta variant, was first detected in India and has been identified in at least 85 countries. In the United States, where its prevalence has doubled in the last two weeks, the variant is responsible for one in every five Covid-19 cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, has called it “the greatest threat” to eliminating the virus in the United States. The rise of new variants “makes it even more urgent that we use all the tools at our disposal to prevent transmission,” including consistent use of both vaccination and public health and social measures, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O., said at a news briefing on Friday. Dr. Mariângela Simão, the W.H.O.’s assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, emphasized at the briefing that even vaccinated people should continue to consistently wear masks, avoid crowds and maintain social distance from others, make sure they are in well-ventilated spaces, wash hands frequently, and avoid sneezing or coughing around other people. “What we’re saying is, ‘Once you’ve been fully vaccinated, continue to play it safe, because you could end up as part of a transmission chain.’ You may not actually be fully protected,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the W.H.O. He added, “I think the first message we want to be careful about is saying, ‘Once you’re vaccinated, you can just go ahead and do whatever.’” The comments were made in the context of broader statements criticizing the inequitable distribution of vaccines around the globe and the lack of access to vaccination in many parts of the world where the virus is spreading. Covax, the W.H.O. program that poor countries rely on for vaccines, has “zero doses” of AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines, or those made by the Serum Institute of India, available for distribution, Dr. Aylward said. While less than 2 percent of the population of Africa is vaccinated, some countries are purchasing vaccines for young people who are at relatively low risk from the virus, he noted. Even in countries where there are ample supplies of vaccine, full vaccination rates are lower than they could be, Dr. Alyward said. Though fully vaccinated people are largely protected from symptomatic and asymptomatic coronavirus infections, studies suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s efficacy against the Delta variant is slightly lower than against other variants; the efficacy is significantly lower for individuals who have received only one dose of the vaccine. And countries with relatively high vaccination rates have seen an uptick in infections driven by the Delta variant: Britain, where some two-thirds of the population has received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine and just under half have received two doses, is nonetheless grappling with a sharp rise in infections from the variant. In Israel, which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, a rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has led the government to reimpose mask mandates indoors and at large outdoor gatherings. Given how pernicious and fast moving the variant is, “the vaccine approach is not enough,” said Eric Feigl-Ding, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. “We’re not at the level of vaccinations where we can release the brakes on everything else and herd immunity will grind transmissions to a halt.” Other scientists disagreed, saying guidance has to be more nuanced and tailored to local communities, varying according to vaccination rates and infection rates. “The W.H.O. is looking at a world that is largely unvaccinated, so this makes sense,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. In parts of the United States with low vaccination rates, too, masks may be appropriate, and recommendations should be tailored appropriately, he added: “If I were living in Missouri or Wyoming or Mississippi, places with low vaccination rates, I would not be excited about going indoors without wearing a mask — even though I’m vaccinated.” Vaccine Protection General practitioner displaying empty vials of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines in Berlin in April.Credit…Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters Early results from a British vaccine study suggest that mixing different brands of vaccines can provoke a protective immune response against Covid-19. In the trial, volunteers produced high levels of antibodies and immune cells after getting one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and one dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot. Administering the vaccines in either order is likely to provide potent protection, Dr. Matthew Snape, a vaccine expert at the University of Oxford, said at a news conference on Monday. “Any of these schedules, I think could be argued, would be expected to be effective,” he said. Dr. Snape and his colleagues began the trial, called Com-COV, in February. In the first wave of the study, they gave 830 volunteers one of four combinations of vaccines. Some got two doses of either Pfizer or AstraZeneca, both of which have been shown to be effective against Covid-19. Others got a dose of AstraZeneca, followed by one of Pfizer, or vice versa. For the first wave of volunteers, the researchers waited four weeks between doses. Studies have found that the AstraZeneca vaccine provides stronger protection if the second dose is delayed for up to 12 weeks, so the researchers are also running a separate 12-week trial which should deliver results next month. The researchers found that volunteers reported more chills, headaches and muscle pain than people who get two doses of the same vaccine. But the side effects were short-lived. Dr. Snape and his colleagues then drew blood to measure the immune response in the volunteers. They found that those who got two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech produced levels of antibodies about 10 times as high as those who got two doses of AstraZeneca. Volunteers who got Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca showed antibody levels about five times as high as those with two doses of AstraZeneca. And volunteers who got AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer reached antibody levels about as high as those who got two doses of Pfizer. Dr. Snape said that the differences would most likely narrow in the volunteers who get a second dose after 12 weeks, when the AstraZeneca vaccine has had more time to strengthen its effects. The study also found that using different vaccines produced a higher level of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus than did giving two doses of the same vaccine. Dr. Snape said it wasn’t clear yet why mixing had that advantage. “It’s very intriguing, let’s say that much,” he said. Dr. Snape and his colleagues have begun a similar trial, adding vaccines from Moderna and Novavax to the list of possibilities. For now, he said, the best course of action remains getting two doses of the same vaccine. Large clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that this strategy reduces the chances of getting Covid-19. “Your default should be what is proven to work,” Dr. Snape said. But there are many cases in which that may not be possible. Vaccine shipments are sometimes delayed because of manufacturing problems, for example. Younger people in some countries have been advised not to get a second dose of AstraZeneca because of concerns about the small risk of developing blood clots. In such situations, it’s important to know whether people can switch to another vaccine. “This provides reassuring evidence that should work,” Dr. Snape said. Vaccine Protection Prepped Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at a pharmacy in Little Rock, Ark., in March.Credit…Rory Doyle for The New York Times The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna set off a persistent immune reaction in the body that may protect against the coronavirus for years, scientists reported on Monday. The findings add to growing evidence that most people immunized with the mRNA vaccines may not need boosters, so long as the virus and its variants do not evolve much beyond their current forms — which is not guaranteed. People who recovered from Covid-19 before being vaccinated may not need boosters even if the virus does make a significant transformation. “It’s a good sign for how durable our immunity is from this vaccine,” said Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who led the study, which was published in the journal Nature. The study did not consider the vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson, but Dr. Ellebedy said he expected the immune response to be less durable than that produced by mRNA vaccines. Dr. Ellebedy and his colleagues reported last month that in people who had survived Covid-19, immune cells that recognize the virus remained in the bone marrow for at least eight months after infection. A study by another team indicated that so-called memory B cells continue to mature and strengthen for at least a year after infection. Based on those findings, researchers suggested that immunity might last years, possibly a lifetime, in people who were infected and later vaccinated. But it was unclear whether vaccination alone might have a similarly long-lasting effect. After an infection or a vaccination, a specialized structure called the germinal center forms in lymph nodes. This structure is an elite school of sorts for B cells. The broader the range and the longer these cells have to practice, the more likely they are to be able to thwart variants of the virus that may emerge. After infection with the coronavirus, the germinal center forms in the lungs. But after vaccination, the cells’ education takes place in lymph nodes in the armpits, within reach of researchers. Dr. Ellebedy’s team found that 15 weeks after the first dose of vaccine, the germinal center was still highly active in all 14 of the participants, and that the number of memory cells that recognized the coronavirus had not declined. “The fact that the reactions continued for almost four months after vaccination — that’s a very, very good sign,” Dr. Ellebedy said. Germinal centers typically peak one to two weeks after immunization, and then wane. “Usually by four to six weeks, there’s not much left,” said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona. But germinal centers stimulated by the mRNA vaccines are “still going, months into it, and not a lot of decline in most people.” Dr. Bhattacharya noted that most of what scientists know about the persistence of germinal centers is based on animal research. The new study is the first to show what happens in people after vaccination. The results suggest that a vast majority of vaccinated people will be protected over the long term — at least, against the existing variants. But older adults, people with weak immune systems and those who take drugs that suppress immunity may need boosters; people who survived Covid-19 and were later immunized may never need them at all. Exactly how long the protection from mRNA vaccines will last is hard to predict. In the absence of variants that sidestep immunity, in theory immunity could last a lifetime, experts said. But the virus is clearly evolving. Vaccine Protection Nurses preparing AstraZeneca vaccine doses in Bratislava, Slovakia, in April.Credit…Akos Stiller for The New York Times A third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford generated a strong immune response in clinical trial volunteers, Oxford researchers reported on Monday. The finding indicates that the AstraZeneca vaccine could be an option should third shots end up being needed, for example, to extend immunity. To date, the vaccine has been given as two doses, typically between four and 12 weeks apart. The new data, detailed in a preprint manuscript that has not yet been peer reviewed, came from 90 study volunteers in Britain who were among the earliest to receive the shots in a clinical trial last year. This past March, they were given a third dose, roughly 30 weeks after their second. Laboratory analyses showed that the third dose increased levels of antibodies to the virus in the volunteers to a point higher than seen a month after their second dose — an encouraging sign that the third shot would be likely to bring greater protection if the effectiveness of two doses waned over time. “We do have to be in a position where we could boost if it turned out that was necessary,” Prof. Andrew Pollard, an Oxford researcher who has led studies of the vaccine, said in a news conference on Monday. “I think we have encouraging data in this preprint to show that boosters could be used and would be effective at boosting the immune response.” Scientists and policymakers do not yet know whether booster shots may be needed. Scientists reported Monday that the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna set off a persistent immune reaction in the body that may protect against the coronavirus for years, but it isn’t clear if the same is happening with other vaccines, including AstraZeneca. Emerging coronavirus variants could also accelerate the need for booster shots. If third shots are deemed necessary in the coming months, their availability could be severely limited, especially in poorer countries that are lacking enough supply to give first doses to their most vulnerable citizens. Earlier this month, the National Institutes of Health announced that it has begun a new clinical trial of people fully vaccinated with any of the three authorized vaccines in the United States. The goal is to test whether a booster shot of the vaccine made by Moderna will increase their antibodies against the virus. Initial results are expected later this summer. The AstraZeneca vaccine has won authorization in 80 countries since last December but is not approved for use in the United States, which already has more than enough doses of its three authorized vaccines to meet demand. The shot has been the backbone of the struggling Covax program to provide vaccines to poor countries, accounting for more than 88 percent of the doses shipped out to middle- and low-income nations through last week. AstraZeneca announced on Sunday that the first volunteers had been vaccinated in a separate study assessing a new version of the vaccine designed to protect against the Beta variant of the virus first seen in South Africa. Some study results suggested that the original version of the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be effective against that variant. Professor Pollard said the study would compare the effects of a third dose of the original vaccine against those of boosting volunteers with the new Beta-targeted vaccine. Passengers at the British Airways counter of the Hong Kong International airport last week.Credit…Anthony Kwan for The New York Times Hong Kong will suspend all passenger flights from Britain beginning July 1, the government said on Monday, citing the spread of the more virulent Delta coronavirus variant in the United Kingdom, which will be reclassified as “extremely high-risk.” People who have stayed in Britain for longer than two hours will also be barred from boarding passenger flights bound for Hong Kong, the authorities said. “A number of cases imported from the U.K. involving variant virus strains have persistently been found in the past few days,” officials said, according to Hong Kong’s government news agency. The restrictions are the second time Hong Kong has suspended flights from Britain. After an outbreak of a dangerous variant in December, authorities barred passengers from entering, leaving many Hong Kong residents angered and confused as they desperately tried to return home. Those restrictions were lifted in May. Now, Britain is struggling with rising infections, recording a 109 percent spike in cases over the past 14 days, though cases remain a fraction of their winter peak, according to a New York Times database. Experts say the rise is likely linked to the highly contagious Delta variant, which is spreading rapidly in other countries as well. The World Health Organization has said the variant is likely to become the most globally dominant strain of the disease. On Monday, the prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, also announced new restrictions on visitors from Britain. They will be required to present a negative coronavirus test or proof of full vaccination to enter the country. In Hong Kong, restrictions on passengers arriving from Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa will also remain in place. Oregon officials say no one will be turned away from cooling centers because of Covid restrictions, which are expected to end in the state by June 30.

In Oregon, where temperatures are forecast to reach 113 degrees on Monday, roads have buckled from the extreme heat, and relatively few homes have air-conditioners, state health officials suspended capacity limits at swimming pools, movie theaters and shopping malls on Friday, and said that no one would be turned away from cooling centers because of crowding. The decision follows a sustained decline in new reported coronavirus cases and deaths in the state, and Gov. Kate Brown’s announcement that Oregon would fully open no later than June 30. Nearly 70 percent of adult residents in the state have received at least one vaccine dose, Governor Brown’s benchmark for lifting the state’s remaining restrictions. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington has suspended capacity restrictions at publicly owned or operated cooling centers and those run by nonprofit organizations in his state, though not for “private, for-profit businesses that offer air-conditioned spaces to the general public,” according to a memo released on Friday. More than 70 percent of adults in Washington have received at least one vaccine dose, according to a vaccine tracker maintained by The New York Times. Governor Inslee has said that all restrictions in his state will be lifted no later than June 30 as well. Local officials in the Northwest have tried to balance pandemic safety with the need to provide places for the public to cool off indoors. In Multnomah County, Ore., which includes Portland, people have been asked to wear face masks and maintain social distance at official cooling centers, including several public libraries with extended hours, movie theaters and the Oregon Convention Center, according to Dr. Jennifer Vines, the county health officer. People who come in are not being asked about vaccination status, she said, but officials are offering vaccine shots at the convention center for anyone who needs them. Dr. Vines said that though the coronavirus precautions were important, they were secondary to ensuring that residents can get relief from the record-breaking temperatures. “Cooling people down is the more immediate life safety issue,” she said.

The looming restrictions, imposed in a series of steps, have sent tens of thousands of migrant laborers in Dhaka, the capital and largest city, scrambling to get to their villages in scenes reminiscent of neighboring India’s migrant exodus last year. The garment industry, which employs 4.5 million people and makes up 80 percent of the country’s exports, will remain open. But other businesses were instructed to limit their operations to minimum levels of required staffing, and almost all public transportation systems are either closing or already closed. Residents of Dhaka expect to be largely confined to their homes after Thursday, the first day of what the government has called a “hard lockdown,” though how strictly the measures will be implemented remains to be seen. The government has said the army, police, and border guard will be deployed for strict enforcement. Bangladesh had slowed the spread of the virus with sporadic restrictions and reduced movement while trying to keep much of the economy open. But a fast-spreading wave now, with barely 3 percent of the population vaccinated, has forced officials to take more drastic measures. The country reported 119 deaths on Monday, the highest daily toll since the pandemic began, while the test positivity rate was over 20 percent. Bangladesh has officially reported a total of nearly 900,000 infections and 14,172 deaths from the virus, though experts believe the true numbers are much higher. The current lockdown has been gradual. The government stopped trains and long distance buses last week. It also imposed lockdowns in seven districts surrounding Dhaka, aiming to avert a surge there. Shopping malls are closed, and restaurants are limited to takeout orders only. The full lockdown, initially expected to last one week, begins on Thursday. All transportation systems except for auto-rickshaws will be shut. The government has instructed garment factory owners to arrange transportation for their workers during previous rounds of restrictions. When the public transportation was shut in April to slow the spread of the virus, factory owners who did not arrange transportation were accused of violating the order, and workers had to walk for miles twice a day to get to work. As the latest lockdown approached, ferry stations in Dhaka have been swamped by people trying to cross the river to the southern districts. New cases overnight prompted the state of Queensland, Australia, to issue a lockdown order for its capital, Brisbane.Credit…Darren England/EPA, via Shutterstock After months with hardly any community transmission of the coronavirus, Australia is facing a grim and unfamiliar challenge: simultaneous outbreaks in several parts of the country, fueled by the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant. On Tuesday, the state of Queensland announced a three-day lockdown in the capital, Brisbane, and surrounding areas. The announcement came after two positive coronavirus cases were detected in the community overnight, including a woman working as a receptionist at a hospital’s coronavirus ward who had not been vaccinated. The most notable outbreak centered in Sydney, Australia’s most populous city, which is now in at least a two-week lockdown and reported 18 new cases on Monday, bringing its total to 130. Other states across Australia also reported new cases and toughened restrictions, and an expansion of Australia’s lagging vaccination program was announced after an emergency cabinet meeting. Tens of thousands of people in the state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, rushed to get tested for the coronavirus, with more than 300 locations around Sydney having been identified as visited by people who were infectious. That raised concerns that the outbreak is far from over. Still, no deaths from the new outbreak have been recorded, and no one in Australia has died from the virus this year. Two people are in intensive care, and officials encouraged everyone who is eligible for a vaccine to line up for one — and otherwise, stay home. Not everyone heeded that warning, and one case in particular made much of Australia smile. Two nude sunbathers were caught violating lockdown rules when a deer chased them from their beach. The two men were found by emergency responders, separately, at about 6 p.m. on Sunday, after one of them called for help, according to a police statement. Each were fined 1,000 Australian dollars ($758). As news of the case traveled across the country, Mark McGowan, the premier of Western Australia, joked: “I hope the deer is OK.” (An earlier version of this item misidentified Mr. McGowan as Australia’s prime minister.)

Jaipur Golden, a respected hospital in Delhi, had run out of medical oxygen. Over the next seven hours, 21 coronavirus patients died. “Nobody can forget that night,” said Shaista Nigar, the hospital’s nursing superintendent. “It was a total breakdown.” Across India, amid a devastating second wave of Covid-19, hospitals ran out of beds and critical supplies, contributing to deaths and worsening an already tragic outbreak. By one count, oxygen shortages alone have killed at least 600 people over the past two months. India’s leaders knew the country was vulnerable. Yet Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and local officials alike failed to prepare for the second wave, according to interviews and a review of government documents by The New York Times. India is a major producer of compressed oxygen. But the Indian government moved too late to distribute supplies. State governments feuded over oxygen and seized tankers, creating bottlenecks and delays. Delhi city officials didn’t build systems to produce or store oxygen and struggled to allocate dwindling supplies. When tight supplies and government missteps led oxygen to run out at Jaipur Golden, some families said the hospital offered no warning. Without a comprehensive coronavirus plan, Mr. Modi’s government has left much of the burden to states, cities, hospitals and even individuals. The oxygen crisis tragically revealed the limits of a do-it-yourself approach. That approach will be tested again. Though infections have dropped, a vaccine shortage puts India at risk of a third wave. Without adequate preparations, the second wave’s tragedies could return. “With an effective surge plan,” said Robert Matiru, a director at Unitaid, a health initiative affiliated with the World Health Organization, “this could have been averted.” Bruce Springsteen in “Springsteen on Broadway” at the St. James Theater on Saturday night. There will be additional performances of the show through Sept. 4.Credit…Sara Krulwich/The New York Times In a city whose cultural soul had been closed for more than a year with boarded-up windows and empty streets, it was Bruce Springsteen who called it back to life on Saturday night, his gruff and guttural rasp the first to echo across a Broadway stage to a paying audience in 471 days. Of course, “Springsteen on Broadway” is no traditional Broadway production. The show consists of a man alone onstage; his ensemble a microphone, a harmonica, a piano and six steel strings stretched across a select slab of spruce wood. “I am here tonight to provide proof of life,” Springsteen called out early on. It was a line from the monologue of his original show — which ran for 236 performances, in 2017 and 2018 — and now it carried extra weight. That proof, he continued, was “to that ever elusive, never completely believable, particularly these days, us.” For the “us” that packed inside the St. James Theater — 1,721 filled seats, very few masked people, all vaccinated — that first chord from “Growin’ Up” was indeed proof that the rhythms that moved New York City were emerging from behind a heavy, dark and weighty curtain. The 15 months that Broadway had been closed were its longest silence in history. In years past, strikes, hurricanes, blizzards and blackouts had managed to tamp down the lights on Broadway only for a few days, weeks or a month. But the pandemic forced the Theater District into an extensive darkness on March 12 of last year, as New York was quickly becoming the epicenter of the epidemic in the United States. Though “Springsteen on Broadway” largely hewed to the original incarnation, Mr. Springsteen also tried to make sense of the moment. “It’s been a long time coming,” he said after finishing the first song, stepping away from the microphone and speaking directly to the crowd. “In 71 years on the planet, I haven’t seen anything like this past year.” “This is not a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Wendy Hechtman, who is serving a 15-year prison sentence but was released to home confinement during the pandemic. “But what it is is an opportunity card.”Credit…Hilary Swift for The New York Times Some 4,000 federal offenders who were part of a mass release last year of nonviolent prisoners to help slow the spread of the coronavirus could soon return to prison — not because they violated the terms of their home confinement, but because the United States appears to be moving past the worst of the pandemic. In the final days of the Trump administration, the Justice Department issued a memo saying inmates whose sentences lasted beyond the “pandemic emergency period” would have to go back to prison. But some lawmakers and activists are urging President Biden to revoke the rule and use his executive power to keep the prisoners on home confinement or commute their sentences entirely, arguing that the pandemic offers a glimpse into a different type of punitive system in America, one that would rely far less on incarceration. Mr. Biden has vowed to make overhauling the criminal justice system a crucial part of his presidency, saying his administration could cut the prison population by more than half and expand programs that offered alternatives to detention. While the White House has yet to announce a decision about those on home confinement, the administration appears to be following the direction of the Trump-era memo. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said in a statement that the president was “committed to reducing incarceration and helping people re-enter society,” but he referred questions about the future of those in home confinement to the Justice Department. The White House revisits the emergency declaration every three months, leaving the former prisoners in a constant state of limbo. The next deadline is in July.

Seventeen days later, he had a $10,477 deposit in his bank account.Credit…Jim Wilson/The New York Times Though Congress approved billions in aid for small companies to help them keep paying their employees during the pandemic, it wasn’t reaching the tiniest and neediest businesses. Then two small companies came out of nowhere and found a way to help those businesses. They also helped themselves. For their work, the companies stand to collect more than $3 billion in fees, according to a New York Times analysis — far more than any of the 5,200 participating lenders. One of the companies, Blueacorn, didn’t exist before the pandemic. The other, Womply, founded a decade ago, sold marketing software. But this year, they became the breakout stars of the Paycheck Protection Program. Blueacorn and Womply aren’t banks, so they couldn’t actually lend any money. Rather, they acted as middlemen, charging into a gap between what big banks wouldn’t do and what small banks couldn’t do. From late February to May 31, when the program ended, the companies processed 2.3 million loans. Most were for less than $17,000, and the vast majority went to solo ventures, which are more likely to be run by women and people of color. All that hustle had downsides, however, including widespread customer service failures. And some lenders now have regrets about signing rushed deals that delivered most of the profit to their partners. Gloria Molina, 28, checked in for her second dose of the vaccine at Samuel Rodgers Health Center in Kansas City, Mo.Credit…Chase Castor for The New York Times As the country’s vaccination campaign slows and doses go unused, it has suddenly become clear that one of the biggest challenges in reaching mass immunity will be persuading skeptical young adults of all backgrounds to get vaccinated. Federal officials expressed alarm in recent days about low vaccination rates among Americans in their late teens and 20s, and have blamed them for the country’s all-but-certain failure to reach President Biden’s goal of giving 70 percent of adults at least an initial dose by July 4. The straightforward sales pitch for older people — a vaccine could very possibly save your life — does not always work on healthy 20-somethings who know they are less likely to face the severest outcomes of Covid. As public officials race to find ways to entice young adults to get vaccinated, interviews across the country suggest that no single fix is likely to sway these holdouts. Some are staunchly opposed. Others are merely uninterested. And still others are skeptical. But pretty much everyone who was eager for a vaccine already has one, and public health officials now face an overlapping mix of inertia, fear, busy schedules and misinformation as they try to cajole Gen Z into getting a shot. Public health experts say vaccinating young adults is essential to keeping infection numbers low and preventing new case outbreaks, especially as the more infectious Delta variant spreads. Since vaccines became available six months ago, health departments have focused with varying degrees of success on urging groups identified as reluctant — including people living in rural communities, African American residents, conservatives — to get vaccinated. But in recent days, public health officials have identified young adults as a significant challenge for a country where fewer than a million people a day are receiving a vaccine, down from an April peak of more than 3.3 million. In a federal report released last week, just over one-third of adults ages 18 to 39 reported being vaccinated, with especially low rates among Black people; among people 24 or younger; and among those who had lower incomes, less education and no health insurance. Global Roundup Tourists enjoying the beach at the Spanish Balearic Island of Mallorca, Spain, this month.Credit…Francisco Ubilla/Associated Press Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain announced on Monday that British visitors would have to present a negative Covid-19 test or proof of full vaccination, bowing to concerns about a massive influx of summer tourists from Britain, which has been grappling with the Delta variant of the disease. Last week, the British government added Spain’s Balearic Islands to its “green list” of countries and territories from which British visitors can return without quarantining, providing a major lift to the islands’ tourism-dependent economies. But the authorities on the islands then asked Spain’s central government for tougher screening measures for arrivals from Britain. Sensitivities were also raised after an outbreak among hundreds of Spanish students who were visiting Mallorca, the largest of the islands, to celebrate the end of their academic year. Spain lifted restrictions on British visitors on May 24, just as Germany, France and some other European countries reintroduced quarantine rules for the British in order to avoid the spread of the Delta variant. Since then, Germany and France have pushed for a British quarantine obligation to be applied across the European Union, but so far to no avail, as countries like Spain rely heavily on British visitors in the summer tourism season.

COVID delta variant mutation reported in India; TSA sees travel uptick,6174,"As July 4th approaches this Sunday, health officials are concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in those parts of the nation where vaccination rates remain low. President Joe Biden had hoped to have 70% of adult Americans at least partially vaccinated by the holidays, but the White House said last week it misses the mark. Now that the Transportation Security Association’s screening numbers are trending up, including the highest number reported since Friday since Jan. Dr. Jayne Morgan, executive director of the Coronavirus Task Force at Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta, told CNN that children under the age of 12 are still not eligible for the vaccine, the Delta variant. “These mutations have the ability to keep learning, get smarter, and eventually bypass the vaccination status of the rest of us,” Morgan said. Also on the news: The delta variant now accounts for 14.5% of cases, according to the latest statistics from the California Department of Health. On June 19, it accounts for more than 20% of cases in the US ► The US began shipping its first doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine overseas on Monday, CNN reported; Send 2 million cans to Peru.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation plans to expand its wishes to include air travel within the United States and its territories, as well as large gatherings for children and families who were vaccinated on September 15, according to a statement released on Sunday. The nonprofit’s president and CEO Richard Davis said on a video circulating on social media that families are being asked to sign a letter of intent attesting that adults and children who participate in the request have been vaccinated. The foundation said no one needs to be vaccinated to get a wish, but has not set guidelines for air travel and large gatherings for unvaccinated children. The announcement sparked backlash on Twitter as the COVID-19 vaccine is not yet approved for children under the age of 12 and some parents are not vaccinating their children. Make-A-Wish did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment. Make-A-Wish has granted over 6,500 wishes to vaccinated and unvaccinated children since the pandemic began, including road trips, virtual celebrity get-togethers, stays and more, the foundation said. The virus that causes COVID-19 didn’t come from the Wuhan fish market, confirms a new study of deleted gene sequences from the virus’s earliest days. The sequences were posted on a National Institutes of Health website, but removed for reasons unknown. Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, does not propose an answer to the question of whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumped directly from animals to humans or accidentally leaked from a research laboratory in Wuhan , China, in its new report, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. But by studying how the viral genes mutate over time, researchers like Bloom can reconstruct their history, find out which cases came first, and how the virus changed as it moved through the population. “These sequences are informative to understand the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan,” said Bloom. “They’re not transformative, but they fill in some really important gaps.” Bloom knows the deletion of the sequences will arouse suspicion among the public, but he says there are many reasons a researcher might request that material be taken offline, including the fact that the Chinese government should do so on the week that the study was published, issued a requirement that it review all scientific information on SARS-CoV-2 prior to publication. Continue reading. – Karen Weintraub and Elizabeth Weise A mutation of the Delta variant, called Delta plus, is increasing in a dozen countries. Officials in India asked Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, three states in the country with the highest number of cases, to increase screenings on the strain. Indian laboratories that have identified and tracked the spread of the COVID variant identified three main features of Delta plus: increased transmissibility, increased attack on lung cells and a possible decrease in monoclonal antibody response or possible resistance to vaccines and immunity. Experts say more research is needed to fully confirm whether it is more daunting than the original Delta strain. “I would stay calm,” said Dr. Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at the Health Sciences Center at Louisiana State University, told BBC News. “I don’t think India or anyone else in the world has published or collected enough data to distinguish the risk of the so-called Delta Plus as more dangerous or worrying than the original Delta variant.” Contribution: The Associated Press"
Sustainability and Climate Change: Join the Conversation with Experts,6023,"The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we experience urban spaces. In no time at all, there was a mass migration to the suburbs in densely populated city centers as people were looking for greener and larger spaces. If the pandemic is an indication of the challenges of a changing climate, what lessons can we apply to create healthier, greener communities? On July 1, to join Mark Landler, the head of the Times’ London office and expert on the latest episode of Netting Zero, “How do we build our houses and cities for a sustainable future?“While we discuss how this change can open up new opportunities for sustainable buildings and urban spaces (RSVP above to join the conversation). The speakers who will accompany Mark Landler on July 1st include: A world after the Covid 19 crisis is currently difficult to imagine. With the lifting of social distancing and the resumption of the economy, we will still have to face the great existential challenge of our time: the climate emergency. How can we reorganize our economies and societies in such a way that the urgency of climate protection is recognized? How can we face the climate emergency head-on and look for transformative solutions for the sectors and industries that cause the majority of our CO2 emissions? These are the underlying questions Netting zero, a series of virtual climate-themed events hosted by the New York Times. Many of these topics will also determine our program for the New York Times Climate Hub, our first hybrid festival, which we will host in November this year together with COP 26 in Glasgow. Net zero is an ambitious goal that cannot be achieved with our current economic model. To build a truly sustainable world, we need to fundamentally reshape the economy to replace our linear take, make, waste approach and create a circular economy that promotes sustainability through design. In this episode, Andrew Ross Sorkin, the Times editor-in-chief of DealBook, was speaking to Lady Ellen MacArthur, together with experts, decision-makers and cultural icons to create circular solutions for resilient communities and economies. There are many links between climate change and public health, but what can technology do to address new solutions? Moderated on Earth Day by Rebecca Blumenstein, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of The Times, this session explored how the climate crisis is affecting our health and how technology can help us accelerate solutions for a greener, healthier future. Oceans are a crucial part of the biosphere, they take up carbon dioxide, absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped on earth by carbon emissions, and produce half of the global oxygen. But as we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the pollution is taking its toll. This episode, moderated by Henry Fountain, a climate reporter for the Times, analyzed how communities and governments can unlock and accelerate ocean-facing solutions without repeating the mistakes of the past. The Covid-19 crisis crashed energy demand and oil prices fell to a staggering $ 37.63 a barrel in late April. But can this shock be used to overcome global dependence on fossil fuels, or will the “new normal” end up looking similar to the old one? In this episode, Ivan Penna, The Times energy correspondent, spoke to experts studying how we can accelerate the rise of renewables to meet urgent global needs during the boom. Investors traditionally have one duty: to generate the greatest possible return on investment for their shareholders. It’s a model that has brought us to the brink of climate disaster, and we need a new understanding of value and return that goes beyond the short-term and drives resources towards scalable solutions. Moderated by Chris Flavelle, a climate correspondent for the Times, we asked this episode how we can fundamentally reshape financial markets to make responsible, climate-conscious investing the rule rather than the exception. The foods we grow and consume have a huge impact on climate change, with agricultural production accounting for 20 to 30 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. If we want to achieve the international goal of net zero emissions by 2050, we must quickly implement radical but achievable solutions. How can we significantly reduce emissions in key sectors of the food system while maintaining nutritional balance and food security? Led by Somini Sengupta, international climate reporter at The Times, examined this episode on how we can significantly reduce emissions in key sectors of the food system. While the clock is ticking for climate protection measures, our speakers examined how urban climate initiatives can be transferred from the experimental to the everyday. What are the winning innovations in building materials, energy and mobility that can be used to make cities more sustainable and accessible? Moderated by Brad Plumer, a climate reporter for the Times, this episode explored what mindsets, models and approaches could take urban “laboratories” beyond pilot programs to the next level of systemic change. This year, coronavirus-related coronavirus corporations have adjusted production, governments poured money into technology, central banks approved extraordinary stimulus packages, and societies mobilized to protect the weakest. In our first episode of Netting Zero, Hannah Fairfield, the Times climate editor, asked experts if this global change created the blueprint for tackling climate change. Subscribers.

Vice President Harris Visits U.S.-Mexican Border,3774,"For weeks, Republicans criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for failing to visit the border as part of her work to tackle the root causes of migration. On Friday, the vice president made the trip and said a meeting with young girls at a border facility reminded her that the issue should not be reduced to party politics. “They asked me, ‘How do you become the first female vice president?’” Said Ms. Harris. “It also reminds me that this issue cannot be reduced to a political issue. We talk about children, we talk about families, we talk about suffering. ” From the first minutes of her journey, Mrs. Harris was politically far from a rare moment of calm in Washington. As President Biden celebrated a tentative bipartisan infrastructure package deal and celebrated Pride Month, Ms. Harris faced sensitive questions from reporters. “The plan was always to come here,” she said. “And I think we will have a good and productive day.” She and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas faced a flurry of questions about the Biden government’s handling of an influx of migrants. She has been criticized for visiting El Paso instead of the lower Rio Grande Valley, which is believed to be the epicenter of the migration surge. “Here in El Paso, the previous administration’s child separation policy has been implemented,” said Ms. Harris. She has also been criticized for not visiting a tent complex in nearby Fort Bliss where migrant children are held. The Biden government announced that Xavier Becerra, the Minister for Health and Human Services, would go there next week. And Ms. Harris and Mr. Mayorkas were asked when the government would end Title 42, a Trump-era rule that allows the U.S. government to expel migrants, including asylum seekers, on public health grounds. The administration is working on plans for this, but on Friday Mayorkas said the decision would ultimately be made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ms. Harris received praise from Democrats, who said her trip showed a commitment to solving an issue that has weighed on presidential administrations for decades. “Your presence in El Paso today is a sign of your care and commitment to meaningful immigration reform,” said Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who stood next to her on the tarmac in El Paso. “And I want to join her and say that Congress must do its part.” Others said, however, Ms. Harris should have used the trip to visit facilities strained by the influx of adult migrants and unaccompanied children, as well as spend more time with local officials, landowners and border guards dealing with the problem. “She will check the box to go to the border,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who wrote a letter to Ms. Harris last week inviting her to visit, said in an interview. “The people down there don’t need a pat on the shoulder. You need resources and equipment. “ Ms. Harris visited the Customs and Border Protection Processing Center in El Paso, where she received a briefing and inquired about the technology used to scan vehicles at the border and handle illegal border crossings. “I could imagine it would also improve accuracy,” Ms. Harris said when speaking to an officer. “Can I look at the files?” Although her office denies politics played a role in her visit, the stop is politically significant. A major port of entry, El Paso has intricate connections with former President Donald J. Trump, who will soon be traveling to the border with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas. The number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has reached a record high under the Biden administration, and officials have struggled to get them quickly out of cramped facilities and into the care of family members."
Gates Foundation gives $122M for Univ. of Washington study on monthly HIV pill,2423,"Connie Celum, UW Professor of Public Health (University of Washington Photo) University of Washington researchers will test a monthly pill to help prevent HIV in women, with a new $ 122 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The grant is one of the first to emerge from the Gates Foundation since Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their divorce in May and days after Warren Buffett, the organization’s only other trustee, stepped down. The research is in line with French Gates’ focus on women and girls. The Phase 3 randomized study will compare the effectiveness of islatravir, a monthly pill under development by Merck, with a standard daily pill for the prevention of HIV-1. The daily pill is already approved for HIV prevention, an approach called pre-exposure prophylaxis. The study will take part in 4,500 healthy, non-HIV infected women in 21 locations in Africa and 500 women in the US Young women in Africa account for around 25% of new HIV infections worldwide. A monthly pill offers the possibility of improved usability and adherence. “The whole field is moving towards less adherence-dependent and simpler strategies for HIV prevention practitioners,” said Connie Celum, the study’s lead investigator and UW professor of global health. Taking a daily pill can also raise barriers in populations where sexual activity is stigmatized. A study last year by Celum Jared Baeten, also a UW professor of global health, found that young African women had some of the biggest doubts about pre-exposure prophylaxis, citing issues like discreet product storage. “If you only had to take a small tablet once a month and didn’t have to worry about taking and storing the pills every day, that’s a completely different ball game,” says Celum. To assess the effectiveness of islatravir, the researchers landed on a “double-blind, double-dummy” study design. Participants will receive one of two treatments: a daily pre-exposure prophylaxis pill and a monthly placebo that looks like islatravir, or a daily placebo and a monthly dose of islatravir. The researchers will compare the HIV infection rate among women in the two study arms. The new study has started enrollment in the US and will begin screening subjects in Africa this month. To date, the Gates Foundation has donated more than $ 3 billion in HIV grants and nearly $ 3 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria."

Here is one of the many excellent recommendations we received: Marketer’s Name: Dylan Max Name of the recommender: Kris Rudeegraap, Sendoso Recommendation: “Dylan Max’s creativity sets him apart from 99% of those who do growth marketing. One of his first campaigns went viral on LinkedIn. We ran a special campaign where we sent real cans of spam to the best marketers and sellers (our target audience) with the idea that traditional spamming has become impersonal and we are interested in changing that. The nominees could “spam” other marketers or sellers on their network, which sparked a viral sensation that LinkedIn took over. We did a ton of business with it and our sales team still lists it as one of the most creative ways to use direct mail and gifts. Even today, it is LinkedIn’s most viral grassroots campaign in the B2B space. Dylan is one of a rare breed of growth marketers who excel in many different marketing channels, including SEO, paid search, conversion rate optimization (CRO), and A / B testing. Dylan also launched our first-ever ABM campaign, using hyper-targeted social media ads to drive seven-digit sales with less than $ 20,000 in ad spend.

"Biden Agrees to Bipartisan Group’s Infrastructure Plan, Saying ‘We Have a Deal’",39890,"Video transcript Back transcript For me, investment in our physical and human infrastructure are inextricably intertwined, both make us better off and stronger. The case for these investments is clear. Economists left, right and center, independent Wall Street forecasters, they all say that these kinds of public investments mean more jobs, more workers participating in the labor force, higher productivity and higher growth for our economy over the long run. Both need to get done. We need physical physical infrastructure, but we also need the human infrastructure as well. They’re a part of my overall plan. What we agreed on today is what we could agree on: the physical infrastructure. There was no agreement on the rest. We’re going to have to do that through the budget process. And we need a fairer tax system to pay for it all. I’m not going to rest until all — both get to my desk. I know there are some of my party who discourage me from seeking the agreement with our Republican colleagues, who said that we should go bigger and go alone. To them, I say this, I’ve already shown in my young presidency that I’m prepared to do whatever needs to get done to move the country forward. That’s what I did with the American Rescue Plan, which was $1.9 trillion. Let me say this. When we can find common ground, though, working across party lines, that is what I will seek to do. President Biden on Thursday endorsed a bipartisan infrastructure deal which includes $579 billion in new investments for roads, broadband internet and electric utilities.CreditCredit…Pete Marovich for The New York Times President Biden struck an infrastructure deal on Thursday with a bipartisan group of senators, signing on to their plan to provide about $579 billion in new investments in roads, broadband internet, electric utilities and other projects in hopes of moving a crucial piece of his economic agenda through Congress. “We have a deal,” Mr. Biden said outside the White House, standing beside a group of Republicans and Democrats after a meeting in the Oval Office where they outlined their proposal. “I think it’s really important we’ve all agreed that none of us got all that we wanted.” Mr. Biden’s endorsement marked a breakthrough in his efforts to forge an infrastructure compromise, but it was far from a guarantee that the package would be enacted. Both the president and top Democrats say the plan, which constitutes a fraction of the $4 trillion economic proposal Mr. Biden has put forth, can only move together with a much larger package of spending and tax increases that Democrats are planning to try to push through Congress unilaterally, over the opposition of Republicans. “If this is the only thing that comes to me, I’m not signing it,” Mr. Biden said during remarks in the East Room of the White House. “It’s in tandem.” Still, he signaled optimism about the success of the compromise, calling it a major win for his economic agenda, for America’s competitive stance against China and for democracy itself. “This agreement signals to the world that we can function, deliver and do significant things,” he said, standing with Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr. Biden noted that the deal includes about two-thirds of the funding that he had called for in several parts of his American Jobs Plan, in areas like clean power and environmental resilience. He also took on liberals in his party who had criticized the negotiations, casting the outcome as both a sign of what is still possible in an increasingly polarized Washington and a first step in a process that could also include a larger budget reconciliation bill that would likely pass with only Democratic votes. “It’s hard,” Mr. Biden said of bipartisan compromise, “but it’s necessary, and it can get done.” It’s not clear, though, that the bipartisan plan — a product of five Republicans and five Democrats — will muster the support of at least 60 senators to overcome any filibuster. And the two-track strategy promises to be a heavy lift for Democrats in a Congress where they have only the thinnest of majorities, and moderates and progressives have very different priorities. Still, if it succeeds, the bipartisan plan would, for the first time since President Barack Obama’s 2009 economic rescue plan, pump significant federal investments into the nation’s crumbling infrastructure — not only roads, bridges, and transit, but broadband, waterways and coastlines eroding as the planet warms. Under the plan, $312 billion would go to transportation projects, $65 billion to broadband and $55 billion to waterways. A large sum, $47 billion, is earmarked for “resilience” — a down payment on Mr. Biden’s promise to deal with the impact of climate change. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said the package would pump around $40 billion into Internal Revenue Service enforcement to produce a net gain in tax revenues of $100 billion. A separate infrastructure finance program would leverage $20 billion in federal money to produce $180 billion in private financing on infrastructure construction. On Thursday, Mr. Biden and the centrist senators at the White House cheered their compromise. The president, who spent more than three decades in the Senate and has staked his success on his reputation as a dealmaker, said the agreement “reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up in the United States Congress.” “This does represent a historic investment in our nation’s infrastructure,” Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona, who helped spearhead the talks that led to the agreement, said at the White House. But it would leave large swaths of the president’s economic proposals — including much of his proposed spending to combat climate change, along with investments in child care, education and other social programs — for a potential future bill that Democrats would try to pass without any Republican votes using a procedural mechanism known as reconciliation. On Capitol Hill, Democrats signaled openness to accepting the initial details of the agreement, provided that their moderate colleagues accept a second, much larger reconciliation package. “There ain’t no infrastructure bill without the reconciliation bill,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Thursday, repeating a comment she had made privately on a call with House Democratic leaders, according to two officials familiar with it. President Biden says he supports an infrastructure deal reached by the bipartisan group of senators.Credit…Pete Marovich for The New York Times President Biden celebrated on Thursday the stripped-down and rejiggered bipartisan rewrite of his infrastructure proposal, proclaiming in a White House news conference that it was a unifying accomplishment for the whole country. Lawmakers have yet to release legislative language, but White House officials laid out the funding breakdown in a fact sheet that detailed proposed allocations for some of pillars of the plan, which would be phased in over eight years. Here are some key highlights of the $579 billion framework — and some of the elements that didn’t make it through the negotiations. Video transcript Back transcript With great solemnity and sadness, I’m announcing that the House will be establishing a select committee on the Jan. 6 insurrection. Again, Jan. 6 was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. I’ve said it now three times. It is imperative that we establish the truth of that day, and ensure that an attack of that kind cannot happen. And that we root out the causes of it all. The select committee will investigate and report on the facts and the causes of the attack, and it will make report recommendations. So we see this as complementary, not instead of, and hopeful that there could be a commission at some point. As I said on the House floor when we passed the legislation on the commission, the Capitol of the United States has always been a glorious beacon of democracy for the American people, and the world, I say it again. The select committee is about our democracy and about ensuring that the Capitol dome remain a symbol of freedom, about preserving America’s role as an emblem of resilience, determination and hope. Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she would create a select committee to further investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. About 140 police officers were injured during the violent assault and seven people died in connection with the siege.CreditCredit…Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she would create a select committee to further investigate the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan effort to form an independent commission of experts to look into the riot. “Jan. 6 was a day of darkness for our country,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters. “Our temple of democracy was attacked by insurrectionists.” The move came after Ms. Pelosi had signaled for weeks that she planned to take such a step to scrutinize the storming of the Capitol by a mob of supporters of President Donald J. Trump, who sought to disrupt Congress’s counting of electoral votes to formalize President Biden’s victory. On Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi told top House Democrats that she planned to announce her decision on a select committee this week. She has maintained that her preference was for the Senate to approve a bipartisan commission, modeled after the one that investigated the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But with Republicans opposed and many G.O.P. lawmakers working to whitewash and downplay the riot, she has conceded that no longer seemed possible. Fewer than 10 Republicans — the amount needed to overcome a legislative filibuster — supported such an inquiry when it came to a vote in the Senate this month. “It is imperative that we seek the truth,” Ms. Pelosi said on Thursday. “It is clear the Republicans are afraid of the truth.” She said the committee would investigate the root causes of the attack, including white supremacist and extremist groups, and also Capitol security failures. “Most of us had our hearts set on an independent bipartisan commission similar to the 9/11 Commission,” Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of Ms. Pelosi’s leadership team, said. “We just ran into a brick wall of G.O.P. opposition. They apparently see no political mileage in undertaking any inquiry.” Mr. Raskin, who led the impeachment case against Mr. Trump over a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 riot, said his team was “not able to follow many leads about the president’s organization and mobilization of different groups to participate in the events of that day” and he hoped the select committee could pick up that work. “We need to learn about how that coalition of extremists came together and who facilitated it. to what extent it’s a threat to us in the future,” he said. It was not immediately clear who would chair the committee or be included in its membership. Ms. Pelosi said she would make those announcements at a later date and said she hoped that Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, would name “responsible” people to participate. Mr. McCarthy said Wednesday that his preference was to allow Senate committees that have already been looking into the attack to continue, rather than to create the new body that Ms. Pelosi was proposing. “When it comes to what happened on Jan. 6, we want to get to the bottom of that; it’s disgusting what transpired that day,” Mr. McCarthy said Wednesday. “Unfortunately, the speaker has always played politics with this. Time and again. She’s never once talked to me about it.” But Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, who was the No. 3 Republican before she was ousted from her leadership post over her criticism of Mr. Trump — endorsed the idea of moving forward with the committee. “It’s really important for us to make sure we have a full investigation into what happened Jan. 6,” Ms. Cheney said. About 140 police officers were injured during the most violent assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. Seven people died in connection with the siege, including one officer who had multiple strokes after sparring with rioters. A New York court said that Rudolph W. Giuliani’s actions had posed “an immediate threat” to the public and he would likely face “permanent sanctions” after the proceedings conclude.Credit…Erin Schaff/The New York Times A New York appellate court suspended Rudolph W. Giuliani’s law license on Thursday after a disciplinary panel found that he made “demonstrably false and misleading” statements about the 2020 election as Donald J. Trump’s personal lawyer. The court wrote in a 33-page decision that Mr. Giuliani’s conduct threatened “the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law.” Mr. Giuliani helped lead Mr. Trump’s legal challenge to the election results, arguing without merit that the vote had been rife with fraud and that voting machines had been rigged. “We conclude that there is uncontroverted evidence that respondent communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with Trump’s failed effort at re-election in 2020,” the decision read. Mr. Giuliani now faces disciplinary proceedings and can fight the suspension. But the court said in its decision that Mr. Giuliani’s actions had posed “an immediate threat” to the public and that it was likely he would face “permanent sanctions” after the proceedings conclude. Mr. Giuliani’s lawyers, John Leventhal and Barry Kamins, said in a statement that they were disappointed that the panel took action before holding a hearing on the allegations. “This is unprecedented as we believe that our client does not pose a present danger to the public interest,” they said. “We believe that once the issues are fully explored at a hearing, Mr. Giuliani will be reinstated as a valued member of the legal profession that he has served so well in his many capacities for so many years.” Vice President Kamala Harris arriving in Atlanta on Air Force Two last Friday.Credit…Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times Two top aides who oversee travel for Vice President Kamala Harris are departing, leaving the vice president with her critical support staff in flux as she seeks to ramp up travel ahead of big vaccine and voting rights pushes she is planning through July. Karly Satkowiak, the director of advance, and Gabrielle DeFranceschi, the deputy director of advance, have both told the vice president’s office they plan to leave in the coming weeks, according to three sources familiar with their plans. A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris said the departures were long planned and that both women are currently engaged with finding their replacements. Advance workers are an integral part of the vice president’s team, responsible for planning all of her trips. Ms. Satkowiak and Ms. DeFranceschi put together the teams that survey venues for Ms. Harris to visit, and negotiate with local officials to get the venues camera-ready. The departures come as the administration has put out a broad call for “advance associates” to help Ms. Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, with a big push of vaccine-related travel in the summer months. The vice president’s office, according to a person familiar with its hiring, is currently short on travel support staff, and the call for advance associates came as the administration has also been planning Ms. Harris’s high-stakes trip to the southern border. That trip was announced Wednesday amid mounting pressure from conservatives and is scheduled days before former President Donald J. Trump also plans to visit the border with a group of House Republicans and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas. The Biden administration is trying to recruit advance associates — an unpaid position where travel expenses are paid for or reimbursed by the government — to help staff and manage the travel of Ms. Harris and her husband. They also asked anyone who previously served as an advance associate to “consider doing so again.” “We aim to onboard a critical mass of talented logistical experts,” the administration said in an email sent widely to current and former Democratic employees. Unlike President Biden, who has been surrounded by the same top aides for the majority of his political career, Ms. Harris entered the administration with many new employees. Many of those officials came in with an understanding that they would stay only on a short-term basis.

With the American military in the final phases of withdrawing from Afghanistan after 20 years of war, the White House has come under heavy pressure from lawmakers and military officials to protect Afghan allies from revenge attacks by the Taliban and speed up the lengthy and complex process of providing them special immigrant visas. On Wednesday, administration officials started notifying lawmakers that they will soon begin what could be a wholesale move of tens of thousands of Afghans. Officials said the Afghans would be moved out of Afghanistan to third countries to await the processing of their visa requests to move to the United States. More than 18,000 Afghans who have worked as interpreters, drivers, engineers, security guards, fixers and embassy clerks for the United States during the war have been trapped in a bureaucratic limbo after applying for special immigrant visas, available to people who face threats because of work for the U.S. government. Those applicants have 53,000 family members, officials said. The officials declined to say where the Afghans would await the visa processing, and it is not clear whether third countries have agreed to take them. The opportunity to move will be given to people who have already begun the application process. A senior administration official said that under the plan, transportation out of Afghanistan will not come with any assurance that a visa to the United States will be granted. It was unclear whether people who somehow do not qualify would be sent back to Afghanistan or left in a third country. The officials spoke on grounds of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the decision. The decision comes as President Biden prepares to meet on Friday with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan amid a worsening security situation in the country. A Maricopa County constable posting an eviction order for non-payment of rent last October in Phoenix.Credit…John Moore/Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday approved a one-month extension of the national moratorium on evictions, scheduled to expire on June 30, as officials emphasized this will be the final time they will push back the deadline. The moratorium, instituted by the agency last September to prevent a wave of evictions spurred by the economic downturn associated with the coronavirus pandemic and extended earlier this year, has significantly limited the economic damage to renters and sharply reduced eviction filings. On Thursday, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, signed the extension, which goes through July 31, after a week of internal debate at the White House over the issue. Local officials and tenants rights groups have warned that phasing out the freeze could touch off a new, if somewhat less severe, eviction crisis than the country faced last year during the height of the pandemic. White House officials agreed and pressed reluctant C.D.C. officials to extend the moratorium, which they see as needed to buy them more time to distribute $21.5 billion in emergency federal housing aid funded by a pandemic relief bill passed this spring. Administration officials, speaking on a conference call with reporters on Thursday, unveiled a range of other actions intended to blunt the impact of lifting the moratorium and the lapsing of similar state and local measures. Among the most significant is a new push by the Justice Department, led by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, to coax local housing court judges to slow the pace of evictions by forcing landlords to accept federal money intended to pay back rent. In a letter to state court officials, Ms. Gupta urged judges to adopt a general order requiring all landlords to prove they have applied for federal aid before signing off on evictions, while offering federal funding for eviction diversion programs intended to resolve landlord-tenant disputes. Other initiatives include a summit on housing affordability and evictions, to be held at the White House later this month; stepped-up coordination with local officials and legal aid organizations to minimize evictions after July 31; and new guidance from the Treasury Department meant to streamline the sluggish disbursement of the $21.5 billion in emergency aid included in the pandemic relief bill in the spring. White House officials, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said recently that the one-month extension, while influenced by concerns over a new wave of evictions, was prompted by the lag in vaccination rates in low-income communities. Ms. Walensky was initially reluctant to sign the extension, according to a senior administration official involved in the negotiations. She eventually concluded, the official said, a flood of new evictions could lead to greater spread of the virus by displaced tenants. Forty-four House Democrats wrote to Ms. Walensky, on Tuesday, urging them to put off allowing evictions to resume. “By extending the moratorium and incorporating these critical improvements to protect vulnerable renters, we can work to curtail the eviction crisis disproportionately impacting our communities of color,” the lawmakers wrote. Groups representing private landlords maintain that the health crisis that justified the freeze has ended and that continuing the freeze even for an extra four weeks would be an unwarranted government intrusion in the housing market. “The mounting housing affordability crisis is quickly becoming a housing affordability disaster fueled by flawed eviction moratoriums, which leave renters with insurmountable debt and housing providers holding the bag,” said Bob Pinnegar, president of the National Apartment Association, a trade group representing owners of large residential buildings. Demonstrators gathered this month in Minnesota for a traditional Indigenous water ceremony during a protest against the Line 3 project.Credit…Kerem Yucel/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Biden administration has defended a contentious pipeline project that would carry hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil through Minnesota’s delicate watersheds, urging in a court brief that a challenge brought by local tribes and environmental groups be thrown out. The closely watched filing in federal court was the latest in a series of actions taken by the administration to back Trump-era approvals of oil and gas infrastructure, despite President Biden’s pledge to aggressively cut emissions from fossil fuels, a major driver of climate change. The pipeline, which is known as Line 3 and is being built by Canadian pipeline company Enbridge Energy, has been the focus of mass protests in recent weeks. Mr. Biden could still decide to withdraw the federal permits that the pipeline depends upon for construction to proceed. But for now, the administration is defending a decision by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to issue those permits. That decision was made in the closing days of the Trump Administration. The clash between Mr. Biden’s pledges on climate change and his recent decisions has disappointed those who had hoped that the United States would finally start taking aggressive steps to ward off the worst effects of global warming. It also illustrates the difficulties of weaning the country off the oil and gas that has long powered its economy. Indigenous groups have also been trying to flex newfound political clout. Native Americans, like the secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland, now hold important positions within the Biden administration and have said they intend to hold Mr. Biden to his campaign promises on racial equity, particularly for tribal communities. “We are extremely disappointed that the Biden Administration continues the Trump Administration’s policy of ignoring tribal rights, environmental justice, and climate concerns in favor of fossil fuel industry profits,” Moneen Nasmith of the environmental legal organization Earthjustice, one of the lawyers on the case, said in an email. The Enbridge project, which received its final approvals under President Donald J. Trump, is a 340-mile rerouting in a wider pipeline network. Once completed, it would carry 760,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta across northern Minnesota and into Wisconsin to the tip of Lake Superior. It would replace an older crude oil pipeline, built in the 1960s, that has had problems with corrosion, leaks and spills, forcing Enbridge in 2008 to reduce its capacity by half. In 2015, Enbridge cited corroding pipes and future oil demand to say it would reroute Line 3, a move that would allow it to restore its original capacity.

The judge, Marcia Morales Howard of U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, in Jacksonville, found that Scott Wynn, a white farmer in Jennings, Fla., who had challenged the program in a lawsuit in May, was likely to succeed on his claim that the program violates his right to equal protection under the law. Known as Section 1005, the program was created as part of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that Congress passed in March. It was intended to provide debt relief to “socially disadvantaged farmers” — defined by the government as those who are Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander. “Section 1005’s rigid, categorical, race-based qualification for relief is the antithesis of flexibility,” Judge Howard, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, wrote. “The debt relief provision applies strictly on racial grounds irrespective of any other factor.” In defending the program, the Biden administration had said that the government had a compelling interest in remedying a well-documented history of discrimination against minority farmers in Department of Agriculture loan and other programs and in preventing public funds from being allocated in a way that perpetuates the effects of discrimination. Nonwhite farmers have long endured discrimination, from violence and land theft in the Jim Crow South to banks and federal farm offices that refused them loans or government benefits that went to white farmers. “It is undeniable — and notably uncontested by the parties — that U.S.D.A. had a dark history of past discrimination against minority farmers,” Judge Howard wrote. But she agreed with Mr. Wynn who, echoing the sentiments of other white farmers, had argued that the program discriminated against white farmers and ranchers because of their race. “Socially disadvantaged farmers” may qualify for 120 percent debt relief under the program, regardless of the size of their farms and even if they are “having the most profitable year ever and not remotely in danger of foreclosure,” Judge Howard wrote. She ordered Mr. Wynn and the Agriculture Department to submit by June 29 an expedited schedule to resolve the case. She also said that the Biden administration could continue to prepare to provide relief under the program “in the event it is ultimately found to be constitutionally permissible.” The Agriculture Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday night. John Boyd Jr., the president of the National Black Farmers Association, expressed disappointment that the payments had not been made before the ruling was issued. Some congressional Democrats are softening their resistance to voter identification laws as part of an effort to move forward on legislation to protect voting rights.Credit…Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Congressional Democrats, searching for any way forward on legislation to protect voting rights, find themselves softening their once-firm opposition to a form of restriction on the franchise that they had long warned would be Exhibit A for voter suppression: voter identification laws. Any path to passing the far-reaching Democratic elections legislation that Republicans blocked with a filibuster on Tuesday will almost certainly have to include a compromise on the bill’s near-blanket ban on state laws that require voters to present photo identification before they can cast a ballot. Such laws were first cropping up decades ago, and Democrats fought them tooth and nail, insisting that they would be an impossible barrier to scale for the nation’s most vulnerable voters, especially older people and people of color. But in recent years, the concept of voter identification has become broadly popular. The idea that voters bring some form of ID to the polls has been accepted by Democrats ranging from Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia on the center-right to Stacey Abrams of Georgia, a hero of the left. “As I have always said, a person should have to confirm that they are who they are in order to vote,” Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia and a key ally of Ms. Abrams, said in an interview. “What I get concerned about is when you say gun licenses are OK, when a student ID is not. Then I think any reasonable person has to ask, ‘Well, what’s that game?’” Compared with newer state laws that restrict early voting and mail-in voting, limit ballot drop boxes and allow partisan elected officials to take on a greater role overseeing elections, voter identification suddenly seems like an expendable bargaining chip for some Democrats. “I have been fighting voter ID since 1990 when I was in the State Legislature,” said Representative Gwen Moore, a Black Democrat from Wisconsin, where Republicans adopted an ID law a decade ago that Democrats said would devastate universal access to the ballot box. “I don’t know that it’s less important,” Ms. Moore said, “but given the gravity of all the other things that they want to do, like shutting down polling sites, in the hierarchy of needs, I really believe we give them their old No. 1 thing.” A voting rights protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday.Credit…Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times For Democrats, the only way to break their voting rights legislation free of Republican opposition is by changing the Senate’s filibuster rules — an institution-shaking step that so far remains out of reach. But while the filibuster is proving hard to kill, it has been wounded. The unanimous Republican refusal to allow the Senate to open a debate sought by every Democrat on the expansive elections and ethics measure — coupled with the recent filibuster of other legislation with bipartisan support — has armed opponents with fresh evidence of how the tactic can be employed to give the minority veto power over the majority. Democrats and activists say the increasing Republican reliance on the filibuster will only intensify calls to jettison it and potentially bring about critical mass for a rules change as Democrats remain determined to pass some form of the elections measure and other parts of their agenda opposed by Republicans. The White House, which has been criticized for not engaging aggressively enough on voting rights, is promising more from President Biden on the issue next week, though Mr. Biden, a senator for 36 years, has not explicitly endorsed eliminating the filibuster. But to curb the power of the filibuster through a rules change, all 50 Democrats would have to agree to do so on the floor, and so far Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have expressed strong public opposition to doing that. Ms. Sinema’s latest pronouncement came in a Washington Post op-ed published just before this week’s procedural vote, much to the frustration of some of her colleagues. Other Democrats also remain reluctant to make significant changes to the filibuster, though they are much less outspoken than their two colleagues. One of them, Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who votes with Democrats and has previously voiced openness to changing the filibuster rule, said Wednesday that doing so still felt premature. “I don’t think we are done trying to find a solution,” Mr. King said, referring to long-shot attempts to lure Republicans to support a compromise on voting legislation. “We need to give them another chance to see how they feel about democracy.” India B. Walton, 38, has never held political office but upset the four-term mayor of Buffalo in the Democratic primary.Credit…Libby March for The New York Times A self-described democratic socialist, India B. Walton, 38, has never held political office. She was challenging Mayor Byron Brown, 62, who was seeking a fifth term, had served as chair of the state Democratic Party and once was mentioned as a candidate for lieutenant governor. Few people thought Ms. Walton could win, and her opponent mostly tried to ignore her campaign. But on Tuesday, she defeated Mr. Brown in the city’s Democratic primary, making it almost certain that she will become not only the first woman elected mayor in New York State’s second-largest city, but also the first socialist at the helm of a large American city in decades. “I don’t think reality has completely sunk in yet,” said Ms. Walton, who is a registered nurse and community activist, in a phone interview on Wednesday. “I’m India from down the way, little poor Black girl who, statistically speaking, shouldn’t have amounted to much, yet here I am.” Her upset on Wednesday shocked Buffalo and the nation’s Democratic establishment as most of the political world was more intensely focused on the initial results of the still-undecided mayoral primary in New York City. Ms. Walton’s win underscored the energy of the party’s left wing as yet another longtime incumbent in the state fell to a progressive challenger, echoing the congressional wins of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman. While rare, socialist mayors are not unheard-of: Bernie Sanders took office in 1981 as mayor of Burlington, Vt., a city one-sixth the size of Buffalo, nearly a decade before being elected to Congress. But the last time a socialist was the mayor of a large American city was 1960, when Frank P. Zeidler stepped down as Milwaukee’s mayor. Ms. Walton ran an unabashedly progressive campaign in a Democratic city of about 250,000 people — about 37 percent of them Black — that had elected mostly white men as mayors for nearly two centuries. (Mr. Brown became the city’s first Black mayor in 2006.) Her own life has been defined by hardship: a teenage single mother at the age of 14, a high school dropout, resident of a group home and a victim of domestic violence. “This is proof that Black women and women belong everywhere in positions of power and positions of leadership,” Ms. Walton said, “and I’m just super-excited.” President Joe Biden arrived on stage to deliver remarks highlighting the importance of getting vaccinated, kicking off a community canvassing event at the Green Road Community Center, in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday.Credit…Doug Mills/The New York Times Eager for more Americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, President Biden spoke at a vaccine canvassing event in North Carolina on Thursday afternoon, while the first lady, Jill Biden, traveled to Florida to visit two vaccination sites, joined by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. The trips were part of a heightened “ground game” strategy that health officials hope will persuade those who have not yet gotten shots to do so. Mass vaccination sites across the country have shuttered as the initial crowds eager to get vaccinated have receded, and the White House publicly acknowledged this week that the president did not expect to meet his self-imposed goal of 70 percent of adults partly vaccinated by July 4. If the rate of adult vaccinations continues on the current seven-day average, the country will come in just shy of the president’s target, with about 67 percent of adults having at least one shot by July 4, according to a New York Times analysis. “The data couldn’t be clearer, if you’re vaccinated you’re safe,” Mr. Biden said. “But you’re still at risk of getting seriously sick or dying if you’re not vaccinated.” He then warned of the rising danger of the highly contagious Delta variant, first identified in India. In early April, Delta represented just 0.1 percent of cases in the United States, according to the C.D.C. By early May, the variant accounted for 1.3 percent of cases, and by early June, that figure had jumped to 9.5 percent. As of a few days ago, the estimate hit 20.6 percent, Dr. Fauci said at a news briefing Tuesday. “The best way to protect yourself against this virus and these variants is to be fully vaccinated,” Mr. Biden said. The White House has sent key members of the administration crisscrossing the country in the final weekend of a monthlong push to help drum up local support. Vice President Kamala Harris met virtually on Thursday with community groups working to persuade people to be inoculated. At a vaccination event in Kissimmee, Fla., on Thursday, Mrs. Biden held the hand of a woman getting her vaccine before encouraging others to follow suit. “I’m a teacher and everything I do is evidence based,” she said. “But if you still have questions, and you may, that’s OK,” and suggested contacting a doctor. The highly targeted push is akin to a get-out-the-vote effort with volunteers knocking on doors. It comes as the administration confronts a hard road ahead, where the unvaccinated are far more difficult to reach and potentially unwilling to change their minds. How successful such appearances will be remains an open question. Dr. Fauci and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington went door-knocking last weekend in the nation’s capital, but they were still met with refusals from some residents. On Thursday afternoon, as Dr. Biden arrived in Kissimmee, Fla., at the Osceola Community Health Services for a drive-through vaccination event, her motorcade passed by a protester who held up anti-vaccination signs at the entrance. Inside, a line of cars crawled through the parking lot to the mobile clinic, where the first lady and Dr. Fauci greeted health care workers and those who were waiting for shots. “See how easy that was?” Dr. Biden said after a driver received a jab and vaccine card. Lazaro Gamio contributed reporting."
San Francisco to require all city workers be vaccinated for COVID-19,3482,"SAN FRANCISCO – In an announcement on Wednesday evening, the city of San Francisco told its 37,000 employees that they would either need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or lose their jobs within 10 weeks of the Food and Drug Administration’s final approval of a coronavirus vaccine . This would make San Francisco the first major US city to require vaccination of all city employees. “It’s simple – it’s my job to protect the safety of our employees, and I exercise my duty under the San Francisco Charter to do just that,” said Carol Isen, director of human resources for the city and county of San Francisco . Currently, all COVID-19 vaccines used in the United States have been approved by the FDA under what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization, an accelerated process. Emergency Response is an authority that Congress gave the FDA following the September 11th terrorist attacks to enable countermeasures, treatments, or vaccines to be available sooner than would normally be the case under the approval process. The full drug approval process takes longer. Some have used the fact that the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were all used in an emergency as a reason to doubt their safety. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech filed an application for full approval of their COVID-19 vaccine with the FDA on May 7th. Moderna did this on June 1st. The San Francisco policy requires all employees to report their vaccination status to the city no later than July 29th as a condition of employment. To do this, they must upload a copy of their COVID-19 vaccination card or vaccination documentation from their healthcare provider. Medical exemptions are available for employees with medical conditions that affect their eligibility for a vaccine, but must be verified by their doctor. A “sincere religious belief that prohibits them from receiving a vaccine” could also be a reason for an exception, according to the city’s vaccination policy. These applications will be examined on a case-by-case basis. “The burden would be on the worker to establish a genuine religious belief,” Isen said. Covid19 vaccination:Indiana University students are suing for on-campus vaccination Connected:More than 150 Houston hospital workers are being laid off or fired because of COVID-19 vaccine needs Currently, about 60% of San Francisco employees have notified the city that they are vaccinated, Isen said. The city informed the local unions that the request would come. Several unions that include city workers are already running vaccination stations in their union houses or holding vaccination fairs in the neighborhood. The city plans to meet with the unions later this week to further discuss the policy, Isen said. The new policy protects employees and also saves tax money. Worker compensation claims for employees in San Francisco who are exposed to COVID-19 at work and unable to work because they have contracted COVID have already cost San Francisco nearly $ 3 million, Isen said. “That is a great incentive for us, because these are costs that we have to bear – the simple, simple, safe and uncomplicated solution is that every employee can be vaccinated,” she says. Isen said she hopes others will follow suit when the surrounding communities see what San Francisco has done. “The science is absolutely clear,” said Isen. “When you are vaccinated, you have the force field. Unvaccinated you are really a great risk to yourself and the people around you.”"
Live Updates: Biden’s Speech on Guns and Public Safety,43512,"Video transcript Back transcript Crime historically rises during the summer. And as we emerge from this pandemic, the country opening back up again, the traditional summer spike may be more pronounced than it usually would be. For folks at home, here’s what you need to know. I’ve been at this a long time and there are things we know that work to reduce gun violence and violent crime and things that we don’t know about. But things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are important; ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines; community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble. These efforts work. They save lives. But over time, these policies were gutted and are woefully underfunded. In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun violence legislation. We know that if there is a strict enforcement of background checks, then fewer guns get into the hands of criminals. Background checks have thus far kept more than three million guns out of the hands of felons, convicted felons, fugitives, domestic abusers and others prohibited from being able to purchase a gun. If you willfully sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from possessing it, if you willfully fail to run a background check, if you willfully falsify a record, if you willfully fail to cooperate with the tracing requests or inspections. My message to you is this: We’ll find you and we will seek your license to sell guns. We’ll make sure you can’t sell death and mayhem on our streets. It’s an outrage, has to end and we’ll end it. Period. President Biden announced new efforts to tackle gun violence on Wednesday, including cracking down on illegal sales and providing new funding for police departments and community-based organizations.CreditCredit…Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden said on Wednesday that states could draw from $350 billion in federal stimulus money to shore up police departments and vowed to crack down on gun dealers who fail to run background checks, as the White House seeks to combat the alarming rise in homicide rates in America’s cities. Mr. Biden’s speech made clear that he intends to approach crime prevention by investing in, rather than defunding, the police — wading into a national debate about whether the government should give police departments more resources, or spend the money on mental health and other social services instead. The president tried to appeal to both sides on Wednesday, saying from the White House that “this is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities.” Under Mr. Biden’s new plan, state and local governments will be allowed to use their designated $350 billion of coronavirus relief funds for programs such as hiring police officers to prepandemic levels, paying overtime for community policing work and supporting community-based anti-violence groups. City governments struggling with high crime will be able to go even further, hiring even more officers than they had before the pandemic. The money is not new spending, but the administration is for the first time encouraging states to use the funds for expanding policing efforts and crime prevention efforts. The funds can also be used for summer jobs for young people and organizations that aim to intervene with at-risk youths before they commit violence, a nod to criminal justice advocates who have called for political leaders to address the societal factors that drive crime. With Wednesday’s speech, Mr. Biden aimed to blunt criticism from Republicans who say he is soft on crime. But he also tried to bridge the two flanks of his party: centrist Democrats alarmed by the spike in crime in cities and progressives who are pushing systemic changes to police departments that have long been accused of racial discrimination. Mr. Biden used the moment to call for Congress to pass legislative measures that would close background check loopholes, restrict assault weapons and repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from lawsuits. “Folks, this shouldn’t be a red or blue issue,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s an American issue. We’re not changing the Constitution; we’re enforcing it.” Video transcript Back transcript “Vice President will travel to El Paso, Texas, on Friday. She’ll be accompanied by Department of Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Earlier this year, as you all know, the president asked the vice president to oversee our diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador to Guatemala and Honduras. And as a part of this work, she recently traveled to Guatemala and Mexico last month to have those discussions. And this trip to the border on Friday will be a part of this effort. I will note that I’ve also said here, from this podium, and she has also said that when it was the right time, she may go to visit the border. And I will note that we’re at this point, in part, because we’ve made a great deal of progress. And if you look just to a couple of months ago when 6,000 children were in Border Patrol facilities, we’re now at the point where there is far less than 1,000. If you look to just a couple of months ago when there were children who were waiting in Border Patrol facilities for more than 100 hours, and they were certainly overcrowded, now it’s less than 30 hours. In April, there were 22,000 kids in H.H.S. facilities, and now that number is 14,000. Is there still more work to do? Absolutely, that’s the purview of Secretary Mayorkas. But it’s important every component of our government is coordinated.” Reporter: “Was it important for the White House to have her seen at the border before former President Trump has a trip there next week?” “We made an assessment within our government about when it was an appropriate time for her to go to the border.” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, on Wednesday defended Vice President Kamala Harris’s upcoming trip to the Southern border. The vice president’s travel plans come amid pressure from Republicans who have seized on a surge of border crossings to criticize the Biden administration.CreditCredit…Carlos Barria/Reuters Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to the United States-Mexico border on Friday, a visit that comes after weeks of criticism from Republicans who assailed her for not visiting even though she is in charge of addressing the root causes of migration. The criticism came after Ms. Harris’s visit to Mexico City and Guatemala this month, when Lester Holt of NBC grilled her about why she had not visited the border. She responded by calling the visit a “grand gesture” and pointed out that she had not visited Europe yet, either — answers that confounded her critics and members of her own administration. “She said in the same interview she would be open to going to the border at an appropriate time,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said, fielding questions about Ms. Harris’s visit on Wednesday. “We made an assessment within our government about when it was an appropriate time for her to go the border.” Administration officials did not give a clear answer about what made this week an appropriate time. Ms. Harris has held the role since March, when President Biden tapped her to lead an effort to improve conditions in Central America to deter migration north. But even during this month’s trip aimed at improving conditions in the region, she continued to face questions over her absence from the border. Ms. Harris and her aides have since been on the defensive, arguing that she is focused on addressing the poverty and persecution that force vulnerable families to leave their homes. Allies have cautioned the White House not to give in to criticism. The visit, which was first reported by Politico, will come just days before former President Donald J. Trump is set to visit the border with a group of House Republicans and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who has pledged to finish the border wall that became a symbol of Mr. Trump’s restrictive immigration agenda. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and other senators met with White House officials on Tuesday to discuss infrastructure proposals.Credit…Erin Schaff/The New York Times A bipartisan group of centrist senators will head to the White House on Thursday to brief President Biden on their infrastructure framework after lawmakers said they had signed off on an outline for how to fund and finance billions of dollars for roads, bridges and other public-works projects. After two lengthy meetings with White House officials on Wednesday, multiple senators said they had struck an agreement on the overall framework for an infrastructure plan and would personally update Mr. Biden as they worked to finalize some details. Lawmakers and staff declined to offer any details about the apparent breakthrough, but a previous outline drafted by the group of senators — five Republicans and five Democrats — would provide for $579 billion in new spending as part of an overall $1.2 trillion package spent over eight years. “There’s a framework of agreement on a bipartisan infrastructure package,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, told reporters as she left negotiations in the Capitol. “There’s still details to be worked out.” The bipartisan group previously released a statement announcing an agreement on a framework that the White House had not yet backed. Mr. Biden sent aides to Capitol Hill on Tuesday and Wednesday for further discussions. “The group made progress toward an outline of a potential agreement,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement Wednesday evening after what she described as “two productive meetings” with White House officials. The group has been scrounging for ways to pay for billions of dollars in new spending that would be a critical part of a potential compromise plan to invest in roads, broadband internet, electric utilities and other infrastructure projects. “We just kept working at it, I’m serious,” Ms. Collins said. “Each of us brought in different ideas that we had researched with our staffs.” Top White House officials separately met Wednesday evening with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Those discussions were expected to center on infrastructure negotiations as well as a separate effort to move a large chunk of the president’s $4 trillion economic agenda through the Senate with no Republican votes using a procedural mechanism known as reconciliation. Among those expected to attend the meeting were Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council; Steve Ricchetti, a top adviser to Mr. Biden; Louisa Terrell, the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs; Shalanda Young, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Susan E. Rice, who leads the White House Domestic Policy Council, according to an official familiar with the plans. Rodney S. Scott, the chief of the United States Border Patrol, near a border wall construction site outside McAllen, Texas, in October.Credit…Sergio Flores for The New York Times The Biden administration is forcing out the chief of the United States Border Patrol, Rodney S. Scott, who took over the agency during the final year of the Trump administration, a Department of Homeland Security official said on Wednesday. The move comes as Vice President Kamala Harris plans to visit the southwest border on Friday for the first time since President Biden asked her to lead the administration’s efforts to deter migration from Central America. Republicans have increased pressure on both Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris to visit the border, where a record number of migrants have been trying to cross in recent months. Mr. Scott, a 29-year veteran of the Border Patrol, took the helm of the agency in February 2020. He was a supporter of President Donald J. Trump’s signature border policy, a plan to complete a wall between the United States and Mexico. The Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that while Mr. Scott had been asked to move on, it was possible he could be reassigned to a new post within the department. The Border Patrol monitors nearly 6,000 miles of the nation’s borders with Mexico and Canada, in between official points of entry. It has been at the center of a highly polarized national debate over immigration policy, particularly as Mr. Trump employed hard-line tactics against undocumented immigrants. At Mr. Trump’s direction, the Border Patrol sought to catch and detain hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including migrant families who had fled violence in their home countries. Earlier this year, Mr. Scott refused to follow a Biden administration directive to stop using the term “illegal alien” in reference to undocumented immigrants. Referring to immigration laws, which use the term, Mr. Scott said that public trust in the Border Patrol would continue to erode if its agents were forced to use terms “inconsistent with law.” Mr. Scott was in charge of the agency when highly trained Border Patrol agents, assigned to investigate drug smuggling organizations, were deployed to the streets of Portland, Ore., last summer. While their mission was to protect federal buildings during a series of protests against police violence, there were reports of federal agents in riot gear inside the city and away from federal property. Mr. Scott pushed back against those reports, but the episode and others like it last summer left an indelible mark on the Trump legacy. A pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol building on Jan. 6.Credit…Erin Schaff/The New York Times The first person to be sentenced in connection with the riot at the Capitol — a 49-year-old woman from Indiana — will serve no time in prison after reaching an agreement with the government and pleading guilty on Wednesday to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge. At an unusual hearing where she admitted guilt and was immediately sentenced by a judge, the woman, Anna Morgan-Lloyd, expressed remorse for her role in the attacks of Jan. 6. She apologized to the court, her family and the “American people,” saying it was wrong to have entered the Capitol. In court papers filed last week, prosecutors laid out seven reasons they believed Ms. Morgan-Lloyd should not have to serve time in prison. It is likely to serve as a checklist for other rioters who committed no violence and were accused of only minor crimes. Prosecutors noted that Ms. Morgan-Lloyd was not violent at the Capitol, did not plan her breach in advance, remained inside only briefly and allowed investigators to question her thoroughly about her role in the riot as well as search her cellphone. Ms. Morgan-Lloyd also submitted a statement to the court saying that she was “ashamed” and suggested that her relatively peaceful part in the breach allowed others to do worse. “At first it didn’t dawn on me, but later I realized that if every person like me, who wasn’t violent, was removed from that crowd, the ones who were violent may have lost the nerve to do what they did,” Ms. Morgan-Lloyd wrote. “For that I am sorry and take responsibility. It was never my intent to help empower people to act violently.” At the hearing, the presiding judge, Royce C. Lamberth, made scathing remarks from the bench attacking the handful of Republican politicians who have labeled the assault on the Capitol the work of mere tourists, calling that position “utter nonsense.” “I don’t know what planet they’re on,” Judge Lamberth said. “Millions of people saw Jan. 6.” Under the terms of her deal with the government, Ms. Morgan-Lloyd agreed to pay restitution of $500 to help defray the estimated $1.5 million in damage done to the Capitol on Jan. 6. Cindy McCain, the widow of former Senator John McCain, endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the 2020 presidential election.Credit…Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times President Biden announced Wednesday that he was nominating Cindy McCain, the widow of former Senator John McCain, as ambassador to the United Nations World Food Programme, giving the post to a longtime Republican friend as he continues to emphasize the importance of bipartisanship in a deeply divided Washington. Ms. McCain, who participated in a video supporting Mr. Biden’s candidacy during the all-virtual Democratic National Convention last summer, was seen as a “must do” for an ambassador posting in the Biden administration, according to sources familiar with the process, and has been undergoing the vetting process for some time. In the video, Ms. McCain spoke about Mr. Biden’s “unlikely friendship” with her husband. “My husband and Vice President Biden enjoyed a 30+ year friendship dating back to before their years serving together in the Senate,” she tweeted before the Democratic convention. “So I was honored to accept the invitation from the Biden campaign to participate in a video celebrating their relationship.” The U.N. mission is based in Rome. Mr. Biden also announced on Wednesday that he was nominating Claire Cronin, a Massachusetts state representative, as ambassador to Ireland. Former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, a longtime Biden friend, had taken himself out of the running for that posting because he did not want to move his family out of the country, according to people familiar with the process. Both nominations had been long expected. A third nominee was Jack Markell — a former governor of Mr. Biden’s home state, Delaware — who is the president’s choice for U.S. representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with the rank of ambassador. Mr. Biden announced his first slate of ambassador nominations earlier this month, including his picks for key posts to Mexico, Israel and NATO. But some of his selections for the most significant posts abroad — including R. Nicholas Burns, a veteran Foreign Service officer and a former ambassador to NATO, to serve as ambassador to China; Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles to serve as ambassador to India; and former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago to serve as ambassador to Japan — have still not been announced, even though multiple people familiar with the process said their nominations had been finalized internally. Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Director, testified on Capitol Hill last June.Credit…Pool photo by Astrid Riecken President Biden on Wednesday removed the chief of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, acting immediately after the Supreme Court ruled that the president had the authority to dismiss the agency’s director. The director, Mark Calabria, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, issued a statement wishing his successor well and noting that he respected the decision of the court and the president’s authority to remove him. The White House said late Wednesday that it had designated Sandra L. Thompson, a deputy director at the agency, as the acting chief. Replacing Mr. Calabria gives Mr. Biden more control over the fate of the mortgage giants, which play an outsize role in the housing market and are central to many homeowners’ ability to afford homes. Fannie and Freddie do not make home loans but instead buy mortgages and package them into securities, providing a guarantee to make investors who buy those securities whole in case of default. That helps keep the cost of 30-year mortgages low. During his tenure, Mr. Calabria had overseen the enactment of a number of rules that were seen as critical steps toward ending the federal government’s conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, which was imposed in 2008 at the start of the financial crisis. Mr. Calabria has favored a move toward privatizing Fannie and Freddie and ending the conservatorship. Many housing advocates and Democrats also favor ending it, but they do not necessarily want Fannie and Freddie put into private hands. The Supreme Court ruling stemmed from a dispute between shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Treasury Department over $124 billion in payments the two lenders were required to make to the government after the 2008 housing crisis. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for a unanimous court on this point, rejected the shareholders’ argument that this so-called profit sweep exceeded the agency’s statutory authority. But he added, now writing for six justices, that the law that created the housing agency violated the Constitution because it insulated the agency’s director from presidential oversight. Video transcript Back transcript I do think it’s important, actually, for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read. In the United States Military Academy is a university. And it is important that we train and we understand. And I want to understand white rage, and I’m white, and I want to understand it. So, what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out. I want to maintain an open mind here, and I do want to analyze it. It’s important that we understand that because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and guardians, they come from the American people. So, it is important that the leaders now and in the future do understand it. I’ve read Mao Zedong. I’ve read Karl Marx. I’ve read Lenin. That doesn’t make me a communist. So what is wrong with understanding, having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend? And I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States military, our general officers, our commissioned, non-commissioned officers of being, quote, woke or something else, because we’re studying some theories that are out there. That was started at Harvard Law School years ago. And it proposed that there were laws in the United States, antebellum laws prior to the Civil War, that led to a power differential with African Americans, that were 3/4 of a human being, when this country was formed. And then we had a Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation to change it. And we brought it up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took another 100 years to change that. So look, I do want to know. And I respect your service, and you and I are both Green Berets, but I want to know. And it matters to our military and the discipline and cohesion of this military. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pushed back forcefully on Wednesday to objections raised by Republican lawmakers about the teaching of “critical race theory” at service academies.CreditCredit…Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pushed back on Wednesday against suggestions from a Republican congressman that the military was becoming too “woke,” calling such accusations “offensive” and alluding directly to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in which some veterans and active-duty members participated. Mr. Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III were testifying before the House Armed Services Committee when they were questioned about anti-extremism efforts and curriculums about race relations at service academies and beyond. Representative Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida, asked about the teaching of “critical race theory” at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and specifically a seminar called “Understanding Whiteness and White Rage.” “This came to me from cadets, from families, from soldiers with their alarm and their concern about how divisive this type of teaching is that is rooted in Marxism,” Mr. Waltz said. Mr. Austin, who is the nation’s first Black defense secretary, suggested that the teaching of literature concerning white rage, as Mr. Waltz had described it, “certainly sounds like something that should not occur.” But General Milley, who is white, defended both the seminar and the broader practice of teaching service members controversial or uncomfortable ideas. “I want to understand white rage, and I’m white,” General Milley said. “What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America?” he continued, as Mr. Austin looked on. “What is wrong with having some situational understanding about the country we are here to defend?” Noting that his having read writers like Karl Marx did not make him a communist, General Milley went on a long, impromptu disquisition on the history of racism in the military and the need for cadets and service members alike to study it. “I do want to know,” he said. “It matters to our military and the discipline and cohesion of this military.” For the 29th year, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to condemn the Cold War-era American embargo on Cuba, with many diplomats exhorting the Biden administration to resume the reconciliation that was upended by former President Donald J. Trump. The Biden administration’s “no” vote appeared to signal, at least for now, that it would move cautiously to undo Mr. Trump’s policy on Cuba, which remains a politically contentious issue in the United States — particularly in Florida, home to many Cubans who fled Fidel Castro and his successors. The U.N. resolution denouncing the six-decade embargo is symbolic only, having no practical effect. But the vote, held since 1992, amounts to a tradition for critics of American policy to vent their anger and express solidarity with Cuba at the United Nations. The United States had always voted against the resolution until it abstained from the vote during the last year of the Obama administration, while Mr. Biden was vice president, signaling a move to fully repair U.S. relations with Cuba after more than a half-century of estrangement. But Mr. Trump sought to reverse that direction after he took office, and the United States resumed voting against the resolution during his term. He went much further, adding sanctions on Cuba and — in his final weeks in office — putting the country back on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. A full termination of the embargo, which can only be rescinded by Congress, seems highly unlikely any time soon. But Mr. Biden is still expected to gradually move away from Mr. Trump’s stance on Cuba. Brandi Levy, a Pennsylvania high school student, had expressed her dismay on Snapchat over not making the varsity cheerleading squad.Credit…Danna Singer/ACLU, via Getty The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a Pennsylvania school district had violated the First Amendment by punishing a student for a vulgar social-media message sent away from school grounds. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for an eight-member majority, said part of what schools must teach students is the value of free speech. “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy,” he wrote. “Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’” “Schools have a strong interest in ensuring that future generations understand the workings in practice of the well-known aphorism, ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,” he wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. It has been more than 50 years since a high school student won a free-speech case the Supreme Court. “The opinion reaffirms that schools’ authority over the lives of students is not boundless,” said Justin Driver, a law professor at Yale and the author of “The Schoolhouse Gate: Public Education, the Supreme Court and the Battle for the American Mind.” “At the same time,” he said, “the decision is intensely, almost painfully narrow, and for that reason it offers little in the way of clarity to students, educators or lower court judges.” The case concerned Brandi Levy, a Pennsylvania high school student who had expressed her dismay over not making the varsity cheerleading squad by sending a colorful Snapchat message to about 250 people. She sent the message on a Saturday from a convenience store. It included an image of Ms. Levy and a friend with their middle fingers raised, along with a string of words expressing the same sentiment. Using a swear word four times, Ms. Levy objected to “school,” “softball,” “cheer” and “everything.” Though Snapchat messages are meant to vanish not long after they are sent, another student took a screenshot and showed it to her mother, a coach. The school suspended Ms. Levy from cheerleading for a year, saying the punishment was needed to “avoid chaos” and maintain a “teamlike environment.” Ms. Levy sued the school district, winning a sweeping victory from a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia. The court said the First Amendment did not allow public schools to punish students for speech outside school grounds, relying on precedent from a 1969 case. Here are other key rulings announced Wednesday by the Supreme Court: The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the mere fact that someone suspected of a minor crime had fled from the police did not justify entering a home without a warrant.Credit…Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The Supreme Court, which has said that police officers do not need a warrant to enter a home when they are in “hot pursuit of a fleeing felon,” ruled on Wednesday that the same thing is not always true when the crime in question is minor. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for a seven-justice majority in the case, Lange v. California, said the mere fact that someone suspected of a minor crime had fled from the police did not justify entering a home. She added that other factors could change the calculus. “We have no doubt that in a great many cases flight creates a need for police to act swiftly,” she wrote. “A suspect may flee, for example, because he is intent on discarding evidence. Or his flight may show a willingness to flee yet again, while the police await a warrant. But no evidence suggests that every case of misdemeanor flight poses such dangers.” The case concerned Arthur Lange, a retiree in Sonoma, Calif., who was charged with driving under the influence, a misdemeanor, and playing music too loudly, an infraction, after an officer followed him home and used his foot to stop Mr. Lange from closing his garage door. Mr. Lange moved to suppress the evidence against him, arguing that the officer’s entry into his home had violated the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. In an unusual move, California did not defend a lower court’s decision in its favor and instead urged the Supreme Court to rule that only felonies justified entering a home without a warrant. Video transcript Back transcript As you know, my first directive as Secretary of Defense issued on my first full day in the office was to service leadership about sexual assault. Yesterday, I received the final recommendations and complete report of the independent review commission, and I want to thank Lynn Rosenthal for her exceptional leadership on this commission, as well as the talented experts who worked so hard and so diligently to support her. The result is a comprehensive assessment across four lines of effort: accountability, prevention, climate and culture, and victim care and support. And that assessment recommends creative and evidence-based options. In the coming days, I’ll present to President Biden my specific recommendations about the commission’s finding, but I know enough at this point to say that I fully support removing the prosecution of sexual assaults and related crimes from the military chain of command. We are prepared to work with Congress to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice in this regard. The I.R.C. also recommended the inclusion of other special victims crimes inside this independent prosecution system to include domestic violence, and I support this as well. As we move forward, I believe that it’s important to make changes that are both scope to the problem that we’re of trying to solve, and properly resource. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III on Wednesday formally endorsed a plan, recommended by a Pentagon commission, that would remove the prosecution of sexual assault cases from the military chain of command.CreditCredit…Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III formally endorsed changes on Wednesday to the way the military handles sexual assault cases, a sharp retreat from years of opposition by prior secretaries on the issue. The changes, which were recommended by a Pentagon commission convened by Mr. Austin, do not go as far as a bill that Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that she intended to put on the floor soon. That legislation would take decisions about prosecuting all serious crimes committed in the military — not just sexual assaults — from the hands of commanders. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, has pushed a similar bill for nearly a decade, but she has faced resistance from the chairman and top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “As you know, my first directive as secretary of defense, issued on my first full day in the office, was to service leadership about sexual assault,” said Mr. Austin, who appeared before the House Armed Services Committee with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “In the coming days, I will present to President Biden my specific recommendations about the commission’s finding,” Mr. Austin said. “But I know enough at this point to say that I fully support removing the prosecution of sexual assaults and related crimes from the military chain of command.” The competing visions of how far to go in altering the military justice system set the stage for a potentially intense legislative battle over an issue that has vexed the Pentagon for generations with little progress. Some military leaders have begun to protest such changes.

Once again, Senate Republicans have signed their names in the ledger of history along Donal — alongside Donald Trump, the big lie and voter suppression, to their enduring disgrace.” Senate Republicans used the filibuster on Tuesday to block debate on an ambitious Democratic bill aimed at countering a wave of ballot restrictions in G.O.P.-controlled states.CreditCredit…Erin Schaff/The New York Times The demise of the For the People Act — the far-reaching voting rights bill that Republicans blocked in the Senate on Tuesday — is a crushing blow to progressives and reformers, but it opens up more plausible, if still rocky, paths to reform. The law, known as H.R. 1 or S. 1, was full of progressive wish list measures — from public financing of elections to national mail-in voting — that all but ensured its failure in the Senate. But there were roads not taken. Reformers did not add provisions to tackle the most insidious and serious threat to democracy: election subversion, where partisan election officials might use their powers to overturn electoral outcomes. Those concerns have only escalated over the last several months as Republicans have advanced bills that not only imposed new limits on voting, but also afforded the G.O.P. greater control over election administration. Instead, the bill focused on the serious but less urgent issues that animated reformers at the time it was first proposed in 2019: allegations of corruption in the Trump administration, the rise of so-called dark money in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, or the spate of voter identification laws passed in the aftermath of President Barack Obama’s election victories. Originally, the bill was seen as a “political statement” or a “messaging bill,” not as the basis for a realistic legislative effort. One narrow, yet possible avenue emerged in the final days of the push for H.R. 1: a grand bargain, like the one recently suggested by Joe Manchin III, the moderate Democratic senator from West Virginia who provoked outrage among progressives when he said he would oppose the bill in its current form. The Manchin compromise resembles H.R. 1 in crucial ways. It does not address election subversion any more than H.R. 1 does. And it still seeks sweeping changes to voting, ethics, campaign finance and redistricting law. But it offers Republicans a national voter identification requirement, while relenting on many of the provisions that provoke the most intense Republican opposition. Mr. Manchin’s proposal nonetheless provoked intense Republican opposition. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri derided it as a “Stacey Abrams” bill. And Mitch McConnell, the minority leader from Kentucky, appeared to suggest that no federal election law would earn his support. The Biden administration plans to extend the national moratorium on evictions through July, officials said. Activists in Brooklyn called in May for an extension of New York State’s eviction moratorium. Credit…Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock The Biden administration plans to extend the national moratorium on evictions, scheduled to expire on June 30, by one month to buy more time to distribute billions of dollars in federal pandemic housing aid, according to two officials with knowledge of the situation. The moratorium, instituted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last September to prevent a wave of evictions spurred by the economic downturn associated with the coronavirus pandemic, has significantly limited the economic damage to renters and sharply reduced eviction filings. Congressional Democrats, local officials and tenant groups have been warning that the expiration of the moratorium at the end of the month, and the lapsing of similar state and local measures, might touch off a new — if somewhat less severe — eviction crisis. President Biden’s team decided to extend the moratorium by a month after an internal debate at the White House over the weekend. The step is one of a series of actions that the administration plans to take in the next several weeks, involving several federal agencies, the officials said. Other initiatives include a summit on housing affordability and evictions, to be held at the White House later this month; stepped-up coordination with local officials and legal aid organizations to minimize evictions after July 31; and new guidance from the Treasury Department meant to streamline the sluggish disbursement of the $21.5 billion in emergency aid included in the pandemic relief bill in the spring. White House officials, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said that the one-month extension, while influenced by concerns over a new wave of evictions, was prompted by the lag in vaccination rates in some parts of the country and by other factors that have extended the coronavirus crisis. Forty-four House Democrats wrote to Mr. Biden and the C.D.C. director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, on Tuesday, urging them to put off allowing evictions to resume. “By extending the moratorium and incorporating these critical improvements to protect vulnerable renters, we can work to curtail the eviction crisis disproportionately impacting our communities of color,” the lawmakers wrote. A spokesman for the C.D.C. did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Many local officials have also pressed to extend the freeze as long as possible, and are bracing for a rise in evictions when the federal moratorium and similar state and city orders expire over the summer. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced on Monday that his state had set aside $5.2 billion from federal aid packages to pay off the back rent of tenants who fell behind during the pandemic, an extraordinary move intended to wipe the slate clean for millions of renters. Still, groups representing private landlords maintain that the health crisis that justified the freeze has ended, and that continuing the freeze even for an extra four weeks would be an unwarranted government intrusion in the housing market. “The mounting housing affordability crisis is quickly becoming a housing affordability disaster fueled by flawed eviction moratoriums, which leave renters with insurmountable debt and housing providers holding the bag,” said Bob Pinnegar, president of the National Apartment Association, a trade group representing owners of large residential buildings.

In the nation’s capital on Wednesday, President Biden put the weight of his office behind a crime-fighting agenda, unveiling a national strategy that includes cracking down on illegal gun sales and encouraging cities to use hundreds of billions of dollars in pandemic relief money for law-enforcement purposes. It was his administration’s most muscular response so far to a rise in crime in major cities. In New York City, the country’s largest metropolis and a Democratic stronghold, it was Eric Adams, a former police officer who is Black, who rode an anti-crime message to a commanding lead in the initial round of the Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday. The back-to-back developments signaled a shift within the Democratic Party toward themes of public safety. Senior Democrats said they expected party leaders to lean hard into that issue in the coming months, trumpeting federal funding for police departments in the American Rescue Plan and attacking Republicans for having voted against it."
Amazon says Prime Day was ‘biggest two-day period ever’ for its third party sellers,2212,"(Amazon photo) Amazon said on Wednesday that this week’s Prime Day sales event, which ended on Tuesday, was the largest two-day period ever for the e-commerce giant’s third-party sellers. Amid an intense antitrust review of how it operates its marketplace, Amazon’s post-prime PR has driven the company’s ongoing narrative about how good Amazon is for small and medium-sized businesses on its platform. Amazon said Prime members in 20 countries bought more than 250 million items and “saved more than any Prime Day before,” but the company was reluctant to disclose a dollar amount for sales, as it did at the event last year The fall was when it said outside traders sold more than $ 3.5 billion in goods. Total US online spending by all retailers exceeded $ 11 billion on Monday and Tuesday, up 6.1% from Prime Day last October, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. This dwarfs the record online sales for Cyber ​​Monday last year of $ 10.9 billion. The conclusion of the annual shopping extravaganza comes as Amazon responds to proposed antitrust laws put in place by members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Brian Huseman, vice president of public policy for the company, said in a statement that five proposed bills would “have a material adverse impact on the hundreds of thousands of American small and medium-sized businesses selling in our store and on tens of millions” of consumers, buy the products from Amazon. “ In promoting ahead of the event, Dave Clark, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer, also made the third-party community the centerpiece of Prime Day. The small business focus isn’t new, but it stands out this year as Amazon also faces a lawsuit from the Washington, DC Attorney General alleging that Amazon is illegally manipulating the e-commerce market for its own benefit by it penalizes third party vendors who offer products at lower prices on other platforms. Prime Day started in 2015 and has grown into one of the most important annual events for the company, creating a second busy season six months after the holiday season. The company promised more than 2 million deals worldwide for its 200 million paying members. Amazon shared a few stats from this week’s event:"
International coalition joins the call to ban ‘surveillance advertising’ – TechCrunch,10083,"An international coalition of consumer protection, digital and civil rights organizations as well as data protection experts have added their voice to the growing demands for a ban on so-called “surveillance-based advertising”. The objection is against a form of digital advertising that relies on a massive background computing machine that soaks up information about individuals as they browse and use services to create profiles that are used to determine which advertisements to display (across multiple participants). Processes such as the high-speed auctions known as real-time bidding). The leading data protection supervisory authority of the EU previously called for a ban on targeted advertising that is based on comprehensive tracking – and warns of a large number of associated legal risks. Last autumn, the EU Parliament also called for stricter rules for behavior-based advertising. Back in March, a US coalition of data protection, consumer, competition and civil rights groups jointly set the goal of microtargeting. As a result, there is growing pressure on lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic to crack down on exploitative adtech as consensus builds on the harm associated with massive surveillance-based manipulation. At the same time, the momentum for privacy-friendly consumer technologies and services is clearly increasing – which shows that users and innovators are placing increasing emphasis on business models that respect people’s data. The increasing spread of such services underscores how alternative, legal digital business models are not only possible (and accessible with many freemium offers) but are also becoming increasingly popular. In an open letter to EU and US policy makers, the international coalition – which consists of 55 organizations and more than 20 experts, including groups such as Privacy International, the Open Rights Group, the Center for Digital Democracy, the New Economics Foundation , Beuc, Edri and Fairplay – calls for legislative measures and calls for a ban on advertisements based on the “systematic commercial monitoring” of Internet users in order to serve what Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg euphemistically describes as “relevant advertising”. The problem with Zuckerberg’s (self-serving) framing is that, as the coalition points out, the vast majority of consumers don’t really want to be spied on to be served with these creepy ads. Any “relevance” claimed is irrelevant to consumers who find ad stalking creepy and uncomfortable. (And imagine how the average internet user would feel if they could look behind the curtain on Adtech – and see the vast databases that are used to heavily profile people to allow their attention to be sliced ​​and commercialized can be sold to the highest bidder). The coalition cites a report examining consumer attitudes towards surveillance-based advertising, produced by one of the signatories to the letter (the Norwegian Consumers Council; NCC) who found that only one in ten people are positive when commercial Actors collect information about them online. and only one in five thinks that ads based on personal information are okay. A full third of respondents said they were “very negative” about micro-targeted ads – while nearly half said advertisers shouldn’t be able to target ads based on personal information. The report also highlights the feeling of powerlessness among consumers when they go online. Six out of ten respondents think they have no choice but to reveal information about themselves. This finding should be of particular concern to EU policymakers as the bloc’s data protection framework is designed to give citizens a set of rights over their personal data that should protect them from being heavily armed for information – including the Stipulating that if a data controller intends to rely on the consent of the user to process the data, then the consent must be informed, concrete and voluntary; it cannot be stolen, heavily armed, or sneaked through with dark patterns. (Though all too often it stays that way.) Forced consent is not legal under EU law – but according to the NCC’s European survey, the majority of respondents feel they have no choice but to sneak up on using the internet. This, in turn, points to a continued failure by the EU to enforce major adtech-related complaints, many of which have been filed under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in recent years – some of which are now over three years old (but still not t led to action against rule breakers). In recent years EU lawmakers have acknowledged problems with the patchy enforcement of the GDPR – and it is interesting to note that the Commission has proposed some alternative enforcement structures in its recent proposals on digital regulation, such as: B. for the supervision of very large online platforms in the Digital Services Act (DSA). In the letter, the coalition suggests the DSA as the ideal legislative tool to curb a ban on surveillance-based advertising. Negotiations on a final proposal to be voted on by the EU institutions are ongoing – but it is possible that the EU Parliament will take the baton to push for a ban on surveillance advertising. It has the power to amend the Commission’s legislative proposals and its consent is required for the adoption of draft laws. So there is still a lot to play. “In the US, we are calling on lawmakers to enact comprehensive data protection laws,” added the coalition. The coalition supports its call for a ban on surveillance-based advertising with another report (also from the NCC) that shows the arguments against microtargeting. The extensive personal profile and data trading in the background of the adtech industry have grown. The concerns listed focus not only on how dire privacy abolition practices are for individual consumers (which allow the manipulation, discrimination and exploitation of individuals and vulnerable groups), but also point to the harm to digital competition as a result of mediation and cannibalizing adtech platforms and data brokers to generate revenue for publishers, undermining, for example, the ability of professional journalism to sustain itself and creating the conditions in which ad fraud could thrive. Another claim is that surveillance-based advertising is jeopardizing the general health of democratic societies – as the apparatus and incentives encourage the amplification of misinformation and create security risks and even national security risks. (Strong and independent journalism is of course also a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.) “That harms consumers and businesses and can undermine the foundations of democracy,” warns the coalition. “While we recognize that advertising is a major source of income for online content creators and publishers, it does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems that have been put in place to ‘get the right people off the ground,'” the letter said further. “There are other forms of advertising technology that do not rely on spying on consumers, and cases have shown that such alternative models can be implemented without a significant impact on sales. “There is no fair compromise in the current surveillance-based advertising system. We encourage you to take a stand and consider a ban on surveillance-based advertising as part of the Digital Services Act in the EU and enact a long overdue federal data protection act in the US. “ The letter is just the latest volley against “toxic adtech”. And advertising giants like Facebook and Google have seen pro-privacy writing on the wall for several years. Hence, Facebook claims that privacy is at stake; his plan to secure his first-party data advantage (by merging the infrastructure of different messaging products); and his keen interest in crypto. That’s why Google has also been working on a batch of alternative adtechs to replace third-party tracking cookies. Although its proposed replacement – the so-called “privacy sandbox” – would still make it possible to use its algorithms to group groups of internet users in an opaque manner into “interest” buckets for advertising targeting purposes, which also still does not apply to internet user rights looks good. (Concerns have also been raised on the competitive front.) As for its “sandbox” proposal, Google might well consider the possibility of laws that prohibit or at least control microtargeting. And so it seeks to move forward with the development of alternative adtechs that have roughly the same targeting potency (while maintaining their market power) but could potentially bypass a ban on “microtargeting” techniques by exchanging individuals for cohorts of web users. Legislators dealing with this issue must therefore be wise in drafting laws to combat the harm caused by surveillance-based advertising. In any case, they will if they want to prevent the same old manipulations from continuing on a small and large scale. The NCC report points to “good alternatives” to digital advertising models that do not rely on systematic consumer monitoring. And which – as it is also argued – give advertisers and publishers “more overview and control over where and which advertisements are placed”. The problem of ad fraud is certainly massively underestimated. But, well, it’s revealing to remember the number of times Facebook has had to admit issues with self-reported ad metrics … “It is possible to sell advertising space without relying on intimate details about consumers. There are already solutions in place to place advertisements in relevant contexts or where consumers themselves indicate which advertisements they would like to see, ”noted Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy at the NCC, in a statement. “A ban on surveillance-based advertising would also pave the way for a more transparent advertising marketplace and reduce the need to share large chunks of advertising revenue with third parties such as data brokers. A level playing field would help give advertisers and content providers more control and retain a larger share of sales. “"
"Covid-19 Updates: Colombia Surpasses 100,000 Deaths as Virus Pummels South America",43298,"Relatives of Covid-19 victims spread their ashes at the natural reserve of Paramo de Guerrero in Cogua municipality, near Bogota on Monday.Credit…Raul Arboleda/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Colombia, where a surging coronavirus and a dearth of vaccines have led to widespread protests, has surpassed 100,000 recorded Covid-19 deaths, just the tenth country to pass that milestone. Colombia and the wider Latin American region have become emblematic of the global divide between richer nations like the United States, Britain and Israel, which have reliable access to Covid vaccines, and poorer ones that lack them and are left grappling with rising death tolls. The crisis has been particularly acute in South America, now home to seven of the 10 countries with the highest average daily death toll per person, according to a New York Times database. The list also includes Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Peru. On Sunday, the Covid-19 death toll in Brazil surpassed 500,000, putting it behind only the United States and India in the total number of deaths. The situation in South America is in sharp contrast with wealthier countries, where government officials have lifted emergency orders that require people to wear masks and practice social distancing. Colombia has been averaging more than 500 deaths per day since the spring, according to the Colombian Ministry of Health. On Monday, Colombia reported 648 deaths, another record. Less than 10 percent of Colombia’s population of about 51 million is fully vaccinated, public health data showed. Colombia’s surge has steadily been worsening for months. In the spring, Claudia López, the mayor of Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, warned residents that they should brace for the “worst two weeks” of their lives. The crisis has exacerbated public anger in Colombia, with demonstrations over pandemic-related tax reforms intensifying as the nation grapples with rising infections and deaths. There has also been an uptick in abuses by the national police force, with officers beating, detaining and killing protesters, sometimes opening fire on peaceful demonstrations and shooting tear gas canisters from armored vehicles, according to interviews by The New York Times with witnesses and family members of the dead and injured. Video transcript Back transcript “The Biden-Harris administration announced the distribution list for the remaining 55 million of the 80 million doses of America’s own vaccine supply President Biden has pledged to send out globally and allocate by the end of June in service of ending the pandemic. Already, we have sent millions of doses to the world, including 2.5 million doses that arrived in Taiwan this weekend and in addition, sharing doses — In addition to sharing doses from our own vaccine supply, the Biden-Harris administration is committed to working with U.S. manufacturers to produce more vaccine doses to share with the world. And we’ve purchased, as we announced last week, or the week before that, half a billion Pfizer doses to donate to 92 low- and middle-income countries, and members of the African Union.” “Is there any indication that the red tape in this distribution is costing lives at this point? Why is it taking so long?” “Well, first, let me say, we’re committed to allocating those doses. We’ve done exactly that. What we found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply. We have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a herculean logistical challenge, and we’ve seen that as we’ve begun to implement. So, you know, as we work with countries, we need to ensure that there’s safety and regulatory information shared. Some supply teams need needles, syringes and alcohol pads. Transportation teams need to ensure that there are proper temperature storage, prevent breakage and ensure the vaccine immediately clears customs. So this has not, as you all know, been done before. Sometimes it’s even language barriers that occur as we’re working to get these doses out to countries. So, we have announced today where these doses are going. We will continue to announce as they land on the ground and as they are being shipped. And we’re looking forward to doing that as quickly as possible.” Officials on Monday announced a global allocation plan for 55 million coronavirus vaccine doses, the remainder of 80 million doses that President Biden pledged to send overseas to countries in need by the end of June.CreditCredit…Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The White House outlined a plan on Monday to allocate 55 million doses of coronavirus vaccine around the world, the remainder of 80 million doses that President Biden pledged to send by the end of June to countries desperate for vaccine. Mr. Biden has a week and a half to meet his deadline, a task made more difficult as the administration tries to change which manufacturers’ vaccines would be included in the 55 million portion. Production problems at an Emergent BioSolutions factory in Baltimore have forced the administration to revise its initial plan to rely heavily on AstraZeneca’s vaccine for that donation. The White House did not specify on Monday which vaccines it would be sharing, but people familiar with the operation have said the administration is working to swap shots made by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson for AstraZeneca’s. The distribution formula closely followed the one that the White House announced earlier this month for the first 25 million doses in the president’s pledge. Three-fourths of the 55 million doses will go to Covax, an international vaccine sharing initiative that helps less wealthy nations. Of those, 14 million will go to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean; 16 million will be distributed to nations across Asia; and 10 million will be sent to countries in Africa. The remaining one-fourth will be spread among at least two dozen places to help address virus surges, including Colombia, Argentina, Haiti, the Philippines, Vietnam, Iraq, Ukraine, Bosnia, South Africa, the West Bank and Gaza. The donation of 80 million doses pales in comparison to the Biden administration’s plan, announced in early June, to share 500 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine within the next 12 months. But with many countries unable to vaccinate even a tiny percentage of their populations, global health officials are pressing the United States to move as quickly as possible to share its vaccine supply. The gap in vaccination rates between rich and poor countries is stark. According to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, high or upper middle countries account for 86 percent of shots administered worldwide while low-income countries account for less than half of one percent. The federal government has purchased far more vaccine than the nation can possibly use, and distributed more than states can promptly administer as the pool of people eager to get vaccinated dwindles. More than 60 million doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are sitting in storage in states across the nation, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House said it is still working through a variety of logistical and regulatory issues involved in shipping vaccine overseas, like safely transporting the doses and, at times, having to send related supplies, like syringes and alcohol pads, along with them. It said it will release which specific vaccines are being shared and in what amounts later. Manuel Bonilla, 80, received a vaccine in Miami last month. Two C.D.C. studies have found that older adults are more likely to get vaccinated.Credit…Saul Martinez for The New York Times Younger Americans are less likely to be vaccinated than their elders, and factors like income and education may affect vaccine hesitancy, according to two new studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By May 22, 57 percent of adults had received at least one vaccine dose, the authors of one of the new papers found, but the rate varied considerably by age: Among those who were 65 or older, 80 percent had been at least partially vaccinated, compared with 38 percent of those between 18 and 29. Some of the gap in rates could be attributed to the fact that many young adults did not become eligible for vaccination until March or April. But uptake has also been slower among younger Americans, and a substantial proportion of them remain hesitant. If vaccine initiation rates remain stable, by late August, just 58 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds will have been vaccinated, compared with 95 percent of those 65 and up, the researchers found. Vaccination rates lagged for young men, people living in rural counties and people living in counties where a high share of the population was low-income, uninsured or lacked access to a computer or the internet. In a second study, 24.9 percent of 18- to 39-year-olds surveyed said that they would probably or definitely not get vaccinated. Those who were young, Black, low-income, lacked health insurance, lived outside of metropolitan areas or had lower levels of education were less likely to report being vaccinated or to say that they definitely planned to be vaccinated. The studies highlight the hurdles that remain in improving vaccine coverage, with two weeks to go until President Biden’s self-imposed July 4 deadline for getting 70 percent of adults at least partially vaccinated. In recent weeks, his administration has shifted its approach, moving away from mass vaccination sites and adopting more targeted strategies, including the creation of mobile or pop-up vaccination clinics and on-site vaccination events at Black-owned barbershops. The U.S. vaccination campaign began on Dec. 14. Health care workers, adults who were 75 and older and members of other high risk groups were generally the first to become eligible, though vaccine policies varied from state to state. By April 19, all adults were eligible for the shots. Using vaccination data submitted by the states, a team of C.D.C. researchers analyzed vaccination patterns in various demographic groups. They also calculated the percentage of people in each age bracket who received their first dose during a given week. This vaccine “initiation rate” was highest for adults 65 and older, peaking during the week of Feb. 7, when 8 percent of adults in that group received their first dose. Between April 19 and May 22, the share of 18- to 29-year-olds who received their first dose fell to 1.9 percent from 3.6 percent. “If the current rate of vaccination continues through August, coverage among young adults will remain substantially lower than among older adults,” the researchers wrote. In the second study, researchers surveyed a nationally representative sample of adults, including 2,726 18- to 39-year olds, between March 5 and May 2. Among those who said they would probably or definitely not get the vaccine, 57 percent said that they did not trust the vaccine, while 56 percent expressed concern about possible side effects and 36 percent said they did not think they needed the shot. The study also pointed to potential strategies for increasing vaccination coverage. Among those who said they were unsure about or would probably get the vaccine, 20 to 40 percent said they would be more likely to get it if they had more information about its safety and effectiveness, if it would prevent them from spreading the virus to family and friends, or if it would allow them to return to normal social activities. The Affordable Care Act transformed Medicaid from a targeted health care benefit meant to help certain groups of people — expectant mothers, for example, and those with disabilities — to a much wider program that provides largely free coverage to most people below a certain income threshold.Credit…Hannah Mckay/Reuters Medicaid enrollment rose sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, with nearly 10 million Americans joining the public health coverage program for the poor through January, a government report released Monday shows. Eighty million people — more than ever before in the program’s history — now carry Medicaid coverage, for which states and the federal government share the cost. The new figures demonstrate the program’s increasingly important role not just as a safety net, but as a pillar of American health coverage, with fully a quarter of the population covered under it. “The purpose of Medicaid is for times like this, when there is an economic downturn” said Peggah Khorrami, a researcher with Harvard Chan T.H. School of Public Health, who has studied the program’s enrollment increases during the pandemic. “As people are losing jobs, that’s where Medicaid comes in and we get people insured that way.” The Affordable Care Act transformed Medicaid from a targeted health care benefit meant to help certain groups of people — expectant mothers, for example, and those with disabilities — to a much wider program that provides largely free coverage to most people below a certain income threshold. The exception is in 12 states, mostly in the South, that have resisted expanding Medicaid under the health law to cover all adults with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, which would be $17,774 for an individual this year. The expansion of Medicaid in most states since the bulk of the A.C.A. took effect in 2014, though, has proved important during the pandemic, creating a public source of coverage for the newly unemployed that did not exist a decade ago. Adult enrollment in Medicaid grew twice as quickly as child enrollment last year, suggesting widespread job loss related to the pandemic created a huge group of newly eligible adults. “In past economic downturns there has been substantial growth in Medicaid enrollment but it was concentrated among children,” said Rachel Garfield, co-director of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. “This time, it’s interesting we’re seeing much of the enrollment happening among adults.” Ms. Garfield also noted that Medicaid coverage has spiked much faster during this recession than in previous downturns. Fewer than 4 million Americans joined the program in 2009 at the beginning of the Great Recession. There may also have been increased interest among uninsured Americans who were eligible for Medicaid before but only decided to enroll because of heightened health concerns during the pandemic. “The increase we are seeing is exactly how Medicaid works: the program steps in to support people and their families when times are tough,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the Biden administration official who oversees the Medicaid program, said in a statement. Medicaid enrollment had been declining in the years leading up to the pandemic. More than a million children lost coverage between December 2017 and June 2019, a trend that had rattled health care advocates. Many attributed the changes to new rules during the Trump administration that made it more difficult to enroll in the benefits. A vaccination site in Cleveland, Miss. The state has vaccinated only 76 percent of its population 65 and older.Credit…Rory Doyle for The New York Times There are 11 states in the United States where at least 20 percent of older adults still haven’t received a Covid shot, potentially putting the recovery there at risk. People 65 and older were given top priority for vaccinations because they are far more vulnerable to serious illness and death from the coronavirus than younger people are. Those 65 and older have the highest rate of vaccination among all age groups, with 87 percent having received at least one dose, compared with 60 percent for people ages 18 to 64, and 31 percent for those 12 to 17. But in 11 states, seniors who have yet to get a dose of the vaccine pose a risk to their states’ recovery as most places remove restrictions aimed at limiting new outbreaks. Most of them are in the South: Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. Georgia, Idaho and Missouri are at the 20 percent threshold. West Virginia and Wyoming also have more than 20 percent of people 65 and over without one dose. “The 20 percent lines up pretty well with a group of people, especially in the South, who say, ‘No way, no how am I getting vaccinated,’” said Dr. Michael S. Saag, associate dean for global health and professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Among the factors at play, he said: conspiracy theories, a belief in pseudoscience and a libertarian mind-set that says, “You can’t tell me what to do.” “Convincing them that it is in their own interest is a tough nut to crack,” Dr. Saag said. “For the state of Alabama and other Southern states, this is not for a lack of effort or resources. This is about a population resistant to receiving the message.” Older people, in general, feel more threatened from the coronavirus and more likely to die from it, experts say, and it’s not surprising that they have been among the most receptive to the vaccines. After older age groups were given priority when the first vaccines were authorized for emergency use in December, the proportion of those dying started dropping immediately. Across the United States, those 50 and older continue to make up the bulk of Covid-19 deaths, and the virus continues to kill hundreds of people daily. Death rates remain high in pockets of the nation where vaccination rates are not. Experts are concerned that Southern states, where vaccination rates are lagging, could face a surge in coronavirus cases over the summer. “All epidemics are local at the end of the day, and transmission is person to person,” Dr. Saag said. “There is going to be a hot pocket of transmission if someone becomes infected and others around them are unvaccinated. This is not Epidemiology 101, this is common sense.” Last year, a summer surge lasted until September in the South. This year, many people are vaccinated, and there is residual immunity from those who have already had it, Dr. Saag said. What’s more worrying for him, he said, is the dropping of mask ordinances as the more infectious Delta variant spreads. U.S. health officials this week classified the Delta variant, which was first found in India, as a “variant of concern,” sounding the alarm because it spreads rapidly and may cause more serious illness in unvaccinated people. “We’re sitting on a powder keg,” Dr. Saag said. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found last month that 10 percent of unvaccinated seniors said that they would “definitely not” get inoculated against the coronavirus. But the same poll showed signs that some hesitant people have been persuaded: About a third who had planned to “wait and see” whether they would get vaccinated said that they had made vaccine appointments or planned to do so. An eviction notice is placed at the door of an apartment in Springfield, Mass., in December. Local officials have been bracing for a rise in evictions as the federal moratorium and similar state and city orders expire this summer.Credit…Bryan Anselm for The New York Times The White House is considering extending by one month a federal moratorium on evictions scheduled to expire on June 30, in a bid to buy more time to distribute emergency housing aid, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. The freeze, instituted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last fall to stave off an anticipated wave of evictions spurred by the economic downturn during the pandemic, has significantly limited the economic damage to low-income and working-class renters, according to local officials and tenants’ rights groups. But the moratorium was never considered more than a stopgap, and landlords have prevailed in several recent federal court cases challenging the legal justification for the C.D.C.’s order — the public health risk posed by the dislocation of tenants during the pandemic. Local officials have been bracing for a rise in evictions as the federal moratorium and similar state and city orders expire this summer. In some cases, that scramble to assist tenants has dovetailed with the broader goal of improving affordability that is now a core part of the Democratic Party’s agenda. On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced that the state had set aside $5.2 billion from federal aid packages to pay off the back rent of any tenant who fell behind during the pandemic, an extraordinary move intended to wipe the slate clean for millions of renters in a state dealing with acute homelessness and a housing affordability crisis. President Biden’s team has been seeking ways to speed up the sluggish distribution of $21.5 billion in emergency rental assistance allocated in the American Recovery Act this spring. The group met throughout the weekend to discuss potential moves, including the idea of pushing back the deadline until the end of July, which has been under consideration for weeks, the officials said. But they have yet to sign off on an extension, in part, over concerns in the White House Counsel’s Office that leaving the freeze in place, even for a month, could expose the order to a ruling that could affect executive actions during future crises, one of the officials said. Administration lawyers are particularly concerned that the Supreme Court will strike down a stay in a lower court decision that ruled the moratorium unconstitutional. Mr. Biden’s team is pushing ahead with several other actions, including issuing new guidance on using pandemic relief funds that could speed up distribution of payments by states, and increasing coordination with mayors, bar associations and legal services organizations. But tenants’ rights groups say that simply stopping the clock is the most important action. “Extending the moratorium is the right thing to do — morally, fiscally, politically, and as a continued public health measure,” said Diane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, who has pressed the White House for an extension. “Allowing evictions to proceed when there are tens of billions in resources to prevent them would be wasteful and cruel.” A test event for the Olympics at the National Stadium in Tokyo last month.Credit…Charly Triballeau/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Domestic spectators will be allowed to attend Olympic events in Tokyo this summer, the president of the Games announced on Monday, ending months of speculation that athletes could be deprived of a live audience in an effort to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The decision settles the last major logistical issue facing the organizers of the Games, which have been delayed for a year because of the pandemic, all but guaranteeing that the event will go forward despite lingering concerns. Spectators from overseas were barred from attending in March in a major concession to the realities of the pandemic. The president of Tokyo 2020, Seiko Hashimoto, said that the International Olympic Committee had agreed that crowds would be allowed up to 50 percent of a venue’s capacity, up to 10,000 people. However, if the pandemic situation worsens or if emergency measures are declared by the Japanese government, the Games could be held without spectators. The decision to allow people in Japan to attend events indicates a growing certainty that the Tokyo Games, which are scheduled to begin on July 23 and run through Aug. 8, will go on, after months of concern that they could become a superspreader event as athletes and other personnel pour into the city from around the world. Concerns have diminished substantially in recent weeks as Japan’s virus case numbers drop and vaccination rates skyrocket. After a slow rollout, the country is now administering nearly one million doses of the vaccine every day. About 18 percent of the population has received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 7.3 percent are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database. Nevertheless, worries remain. Japan’s top coronavirus adviser, Shigeru Omi, has consistently warned against allowing spectators, which he believes adds an unnecessary layer of risk. This month, organizers said that about 10,000 of the 80,000 volunteers who signed up to help with the Games had quit, citing fear of infection among their reasons. As recently as May, a poll showed that 83 percent of people in Japan disapproved of plans to go through with the event. But those numbers have turned around along with the improvement in the country’s virus situation. Olympic officials said that more than 80 percent of athletes had been vaccinated. Other groups, including staff members, journalists covering the event and some volunteers, will also receive shots. Conscious of the public’s concerns, Olympic officials have also agreed to strict conditions on the Games. Athletes will be tested regularly for the coronavirus and their movements will be restricted and monitored. Failure to abide by the rules could lead to disqualification or even deportation. The Games will have rules for spectators aimed at reducing the risks of transmission, including mask wearing, a ban on shouting, and specific guidelines on travel to and from venues. A panel of expert advisers to the committee told reporters on Friday that the rules were likely to be stricter than those currently in place for other live sporting events, such as baseball. Carrying an oxygen cylinder from a privately owned factory in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Saturday. “There is more need for oxygen, and the number of patients is too high,” an adviser to the Ministry of Public Health said.Credit…Rahmat Gul/Associated Press Afghanistan’s medical oxygen supply is under serious strain, a government official said on Monday, as the country’s third wave of coronavirus cases pummels its already feeble health care system. “There is more need for oxygen, and the number of patients is too high,” said Dr. Osman Tahiri, an adviser in Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health. “We are worried that the situation may become more critical.” Dr. Tahiri said that the government had tried to contend with dwindling supplies by installing oxygen generators in hospitals in Kabul, the country’s capital, and in provinces across the country. That plan, he said, has been hampered by fighting in several areas. The shortage in oxygen was first reported by The Associated Press. The ministry recorded nearly 2,000 coronavirus cases and more than 70 deaths on Monday, part of an upward trend in the country in recent weeks, driven in part by new variants of the coronavirus. Last week, the government recorded the most deaths in a single day — 101 — since the start of the pandemic. The true death toll and number of new cases is probably far higher than those recorded by the government, as there is limited coronavirus testing in Afghanistan. The country’s problems extend much further than the recent coronavirus surge, however. This is especially true in the country’s more rural reaches where recent Taliban offensives have wedged many civilians in the crossfire between government and insurgent forces, and a dry winter has precipitated a coming drought. In some cases, road closures and gun battles at a key border crossing on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border have stopped oxygen bottles from getting to hospitals. “The war has affected 100 percent of the oxygen supply and the roads are completely closed,” said Ihsanullah Fazly, director of health in Kunduz, a province in the country’s north that has been racked with fighting in recent days. The conflict and hoarding of oxygen supplies has also led to price gouging. “There is an atmosphere of fear of the virus in the country, so people buy oxygen beforehand, which has led to a lack of oxygen and even multiplied the price of oxygen,” Dr. Tahiri said. Ahmad Fardin, who works for an oxygen sales company in Kabul, said that empty oxygen bottles once sold for around $20. Now they can cost upward of $150. “Hundreds of people are waiting behind the gates of oxygen companies to buy oxygen,” he said. Travelers arriving in Toronto from New Delhi in April waited in long lines for transportation to quarantine hotels. The government said on Monday that it would ease the hotel requirement in July for fully vaccinated Canadian citizens and residents.Credit…Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press Canadian citizens and permanent residents who are fully vaccinated will be able to forgo a 14-day quarantine when arriving in the country, the Canadian government announced Monday. The new policy spares them from a polarizing requirement that they stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel. The closure of Canada’s border with the United States to nonessential travel was recently extended to July 21, angering people on both sides of the border who have been irked by family separations and the inability to plan vacations or shopping trips. The Canadian government has defended the hotel quarantine policy, which requires travelers to pre-book a three-day minimum stay at a government-approved hotel — at a nonrefundable cost of as much as 2,000 Canadian dollars — as a necessary measure to help keep the coronavirus at bay. Travelers are allowed to finish their quarantine at home once the Covid-19 test they take upon arrival at the airport comes back negative. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the cautious approach was predicated on the desire to keep Canadians safe and not to “squander” hard-earned progress in the fight against the coronavirus. But critics have castigated the quarantine hotel policy as overly expensive and an encroachment on individual liberty. An advisory panel recently advised scrapping the policy, saying that many Canadians were opting to pay a heavy fine rather than stay in the hotels. Others were choosing to fly to the United States and then enter Canada by car, because the hotel-quarantine policy did not apply to travelers arriving by land. The relaxing of the hotel policy for fully vaccinated Canadian travelers takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 5. It was greeted with muted joy, in part because most Canadians are not yet fully vaccinated. Also, the changes do not apply to non-Canadians, including Americans, unless, for example, they are essential-service workers or qualify for another exemption to quarantining. As of June 18, about 4.9 million Canadians, or 13 percent of the population, had been fully vaccinated, and another 19.5 million, or 51 percent, had received the first of two doses, according to data from Canada’s public health ministry. Those figures are expected to rise rapidly once the country obtains larger supplies of vaccine.

But as vaccination rates have climbed, the city’s long hibernation has begun to end. When some capacity restrictions and mask mandates fell away, neighbors, for the first time in months, greeted one other with bright smiles, no longer struggling to recognize the person behind the mask. Family members and friends reunited with long-sought embraces. Still, some parts of pandemic life — temperature checks and socially distanced lunch tables — remained. Last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s order to lift almost all virus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings represented one of the final steps in the city’s reopening. The governor said the new guidance represented a “return to life as we know it.” But for some, the news was only a symbolic triumph, as the most stringent restrictions had been removed weeks ago. And the decision over whether to do away with precautions lies with individuals and business owners, many of whom said the governor’s announcement would not spur immediate change. Some New Yorkers are opting for small gatherings and parties among close friends over bars and nightclubs. And though many vaccinated New Yorkers are no longer wearing masks in public, some say they are not rushing to remove them. Both New York and California celebrated the same milestone this past week: Both states announced that 70 percent of adults had received at least one dose of the vaccine. But inoculation rates remain significantly lower in some pockets of New York, particularly across Brooklyn and the Bronx. Dave Grohl performed onstage as The Foo Fighters reopened Madison Square Garden on June 20, 2021, in New York City. The concert, which required attendees to be vaccinated, was the first full-capacity event at a New York City arena since March 2020, when the pandemic led to the closure of live performance venues.Credit…Kevin Mazur/Getty Images The house lights inside Madison Square Garden went down Sunday night, and the thousands of fans, packed like sardines in their seats, stood as if on cue. As they roared their approval, bouncing in place on the balls of their feet, the ground began to tremble. Cellphone flash lights illuminated the darkness. The sound of a keyboard echoed through the rafters. Dave Grohl, the Foo Fighters’ frontman, appeared on the stage. “It’s times like these, you learn to live again,” Grohl sang. The lyrics had seldom felt so on point. After many difficult months of illness, death, hardship and pain, and shifting limits on how many people could gather, especially indoors, arena rock returned to New York City just over a year after the city was the center of the outbreak. It was the Garden’s first concert in more than 460 days, and it drew a full-capacity crowd that was asked to show proof of vaccination to enter. Inside, people grooved, tightly packed, with few masks visible. “This is a book end to what we have gone through for a year and a half,” said Heather Morris, 47, of Chicago. “We’ve survived it.

And with up to 1.5 million international fans expected to descend on the Gulf nation during the world’s largest soccer tournament next November, the logistics will be no small feat. The Qatari government has plans to secure one million shots to immunize unvaccinated attendees if global inoculation efforts are not enough, the prime minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz al-Thani, told state news media on Sunday. “We are currently negotiating with a company to provide one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in order to immunize and vaccinate some of those coming to Qatar,” he said, according to Reuters, though he did not indicate which company he was referring to. Qatar has spent billions of dollars preparing for the 2022 World Cup after winning hosting rights in 2010. The country will become the first in the Middle East to hold the four-week tournament. In April, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Qatar’s foreign minister, said that vaccination programs were being developed for attendees of the World Cup to ensure a “Covid-free event,” according to Reuters. Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, said in February that matches would play to full stadiums in the Gulf nation next year. Qatar is currently administering the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines to its citizens and residents. About 57 percent of the population have received one dose, and 44 percent have been fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by The New York Times.

Alain Griset, a government minister, told reporters on Monday, “In this new phase where the health crisis begins to subside, we will be able to look forward to this summer in good conditions and to party in complete safety.” The decision comes as France lifts the last remnants of coronavirus-related restrictions that have fueled a deep sense of fatigue in the country, particularly since the start of the third national lockdown this spring. The country’s eight-month nighttime curfew was lifted on Sunday, three days after the government dropped mandatory mask wearing outdoors. Mr. Griset said that guests would have to show a digital health pass to enter nightclubs. The pass, available in a phone app, shows proof of either vaccination, a positive coronavirus test within the last six months — but more than two weeks old — or a recent negative test. The coronavirus situation in France has largely improved in recent weeks, with fewer than 3,000 daily new infections on average. After a sluggish start at the beginning of the year, the country’s vaccination campaign has accelerated and about half of the population has now received at least a first shot of the vaccine. A quarter are fully vaccinated. In other news from around the world: The Yantian port in Shenzhen, China, last year. Efforts to control a coronavirus outbreak have caused big delays for vessels seeking to pick up goods for North America, Europe and elsewhere.Credit…Martin Pollard/Reuters SHANGHAI — Dozens of huge container ships have been forced to drop anchor and wait. Freight rates have surged. Stores in the United States and Europe find themselves with understocked shelves, higher prices or both. The blockage of the Suez Canal in March? No, there is another disruption in global shipping. This time, the problem lies in Shenzhen, a metropolis adjacent to Hong Kong in southeastern China. Global shipping has been disrupted by the pandemic for months, as Western demand for goods made in Asia has outstripped the ability of exporters to get their containers onto outbound vessels. But the latest problem in Shenzhen, the world’s third-largest container port after Shanghai and Singapore, is making the difficulties even worse. The shipping delays are related to the Chinese government’s stringent response to a recent outbreak of the virus. Shenzhen, with a population of more than 12 million, has had fewer than two dozen locally transmitted coronavirus cases; city health officials have linked them to the Alpha variant, which was first identified in Britain. Shenzhen has responded by ordering five rounds of coronavirus testing of all 230,000 people who live anywhere near the Yantian container port, where the first case was detected on May 21. All further contact between port employees and sailors has been banned. The city has required port employees to live in 216 hastily erected, prefabricated buildings at the docks instead of going home to their families every day. The port’s capacity to handle containers plummeted early this month. It was still running at 30 percent below capacity last week, the port announced, and state-controlled media said on Monday that full recovery might require the rest of June. “A few weeks into a very substantial port congestion in Yantian caused by a Covid-19 outbreak, supply chain disruptions continue to be very present in global trade,” Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping line, said in a statement on Thursday. Long lines of container ships awaiting cargo bound for North America, Europe and elsewhere have had to anchor off Shenzhen and Hong Kong as captains now wait as long as 16 days to dock at Yantian. Small vessels mounted with their own cranes have been ferrying many containers straight from riverfront factory docks in the Pearl River Delta to container ships near Hong Kong, as exporters try to bypass delays at Yantian. “It looks like rush hour — there’s a lot of ships waiting,” said Tim Huxley, the chairman of Mandarin Shipping, a container shipping line based in Hong Kong. He predicted that sorting out all of the shipping delays at Yantian and elsewhere could take the rest of this year. The Suez Canal was blocked for almost a week by the Ever Given container ship in March, while Yantian coincidentally halted all loading of export containers for six days early this month. But Yantian’s problems have now dragged on much longer. Simon Heaney, the senior manager for container shipping research at Drewry Maritime Research in London, said the global transportation disruption caused by the Yantian port problems was similar to the Suez Canal blockage, although differences between the two incidents make any statistical comparison difficult. The average cost of shipping a 40-foot container from East Asia to Europe or North America has roughly quadrupled in the past year. Rates have soared this month with the Yantian difficulties. Handling Moderna vaccines shipped from the United States at a cargo depot in Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan, this month. Washington has sent 2.5 million doses to the island, which Beijing regards as its territory.Credit…Ann Wang/Reuters The Chinese government accused the United States on Monday of interfering in its internal affairs after Washington shipped 2.5 million doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine to Taiwan, saying that any form of vaccine assistance should not be used as a form of “political manipulation.” China regards Taiwan as its own territory and is acutely sensitive to any form of interaction between the United States and the self-governed democracy. The donations, which were more than triple the original amount that the Biden administration had promised, were celebrated in Taiwan. In Beijing, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, criticized the move. “We urge the U.S. not to use vaccine assistance to engage in political manipulation and not to interfere in China’s domestic affairs,” Mr. Zhao said at a regular news briefing. The vaccine donations come at a time when tensions between the United States and China are running high over Taiwan. Chinese officials were annoyed this month when three U.S. senators visited the island to announce the original pledge of 750,000 doses. Mr. Zhao also took aim at Taiwan’s governing Democratic Progressive Party, headed by President Tsai Ing-wen, which has long been considered a thorn in Beijing’s side. Mr. Zhao said that the party had “tried all means to obstruct the shipment of vaccines from the mainland to Taiwan and even lied that the mainland is obstructing its procurement of vaccines.” Taiwan’s leaders had previously blamed “Chinese intervention” for their inability to buy doses from the German company BioNTech, which developed its vaccine with Pfizer. A Chinese company, Fosun Pharmaceutical, claims the exclusive commercial rights to distribute BioNTech’s vaccine in Taiwan, but for many in the self-governing democracy, the idea of buying shots from a mainland Chinese business is unpalatable."
"1 dead, 1 hurt after crash in Florida",3156,"One person was killed and another seriously injured after a pickup truck crashed into the crowd at the start of a Pride parade in South Florida on Saturday night, officials said. Florida’s Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who attended the The Stonewall Pride Parade event, along with US Representatives Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Ted Deutch, confirmed the incident on Twitter and said the driver was in custody. “I’m lucky to be safe,” Fried tweeted. “We all here pray for them and their families.” One victim was hospitalized while the other died of injuries, authorities said, according to the Associated Press. Fort Lauderdale police did not immediately respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment. It was initially not known whether the driver acted deliberately. Chris Caputo, a city commissioner at Wilton Manors, said on Twitter that it was “increasingly likely that it was an accident”. But Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis told WSVN-TV that the driver had rushed into the crowd, describing the incident as a deliberate attack on the LGBTQ community. “There is no one way to celebrate”:How to mark the month of Pride, virtual and in person Joey Spears, 25, told USA TODAY that he was walking to the start of the parade when he saw the truck drive through the crowd. “All of a sudden I see this truck come loose and just go through people,” Spears said. Spears recorded a video of the episode showing a person on the ground. Spears said he and the people he was with were cornered by police in a local high school parking lot for about an hour before they were allowed to leave the area. Then they started to march. “Unofficially, we were still walking through the parade because we didn’t want anything to stop us from showing our pride,” said Spears. Photos and videos from the crime scene showed Wasserman Schultz tearfully in a convertible at the parade. A congressman spokesperson did not immediately email a request for comment. Several local news outlets reported that the victims were being taken to Broward Health Medical Center. The center did not immediately respond to the request for comment. Wilton Manors police said in a tweet that there was no danger to the public. “A tragic incident occurred at today’s Stonewall event,” said Scott Newton, Mayor of Wilton Manors, in a statement. “Out of respect for everyone involved, the parade was canceled and a thorough investigation carried out.” Deutch said on Twitter that he was “devastated by the horror we saw at Wilton Manors Pride”. “I’m so sorry, Wilton Manors. I am so sorry my friends, ”he wrote. Florida State Senator Shevrin “Shev” Jones said on Twitter that he was “heartbroken and shocked by what happened at Wilton Manors Pride”. “Pray for and send love to all, including many friends,” wrote Jones. The Wilton Manors Pride event takes place annually in June, according to the event’s website. About an hour after the incident, a Facebook page for the event posted a video of several participants marching down the street. Wilton Manors is a town in Broward County. It has about 13,000 residents, according to the US Census Bureau. Contribution: The Associated Press"
