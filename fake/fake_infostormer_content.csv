Australian Health Minister Shills Indefinite Vaxxing,1101,"They‚Äôre openly talking about indefinite vaxxing not just in Israel but in Australia as well. A manly looking female health official openly said a few days ago that indefinite booster shots would be required for every Australian. 2. In Australia's locked down NSW, where the premier has said only the ""fully vaccinated"" will be allowed to visit their families and participate in society, the health minister suggests booster shots will be required indefinitely for every citizen. https://t.co/yXXcyMju1D pic.twitter.com/XgKs338KZL ‚Äî Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) August 31, 2021 They are really stepping on the gas trying to force feed this agenda down everyone‚Äôs throats. You should fully expect to see talk of indefinite shots in other countries, especially as they shill the alleged threat of the new Mu variant. Whatever you do, do not take any of these shots. Even though this might not be a viable option, you may want to consider moving to a free country like North Korea or Afghanistan. At least in those places you do not have this type of insane medical tyranny being imposed on the people."
Medical Groups Pushing Vaxx on Health Care Workers,1132,"The forced vaxx agenda is getting very real. We now have medical groups pushing the experimental vaxx on health care workers. 56 leading medical groups ‚Äî including the American Medical Association ‚Äî are urging mandatory COVID vaccinations for all health care workers: Requiring shots would be ""the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment"" to all patients.https://t.co/OpG72oxvml ‚Äî Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) July 26, 2021 They‚Äôre claiming that it is their ‚Äúethical commitment‚Äù to take an experimental vaxx so their patients don‚Äôt catch the flu. Nice try, but it is greatly unethical to coerce someone into taking something against their will. It is not unethical for them to refuse the shot. Getting medical personnel and health care workers to take the vaxx is very important to the vaxx agenda since this is the group of people who should be the most informed about it. If large numbers of health care workers refuse the vaxx, people will be less likely to take it. The policy is totally insane. If I were a health care worker I would quit. Let the hospital system collapse in on itself. No job is worth selling your soul."
Fox News Forces Unvaxxed to do Daily Health Checks,1175,"Fox News is forcing their unvaxxed workers to do daily health checks. Vaxxed workers are cleared to work without the checks. Fox News has put in place a vaccine passport system for their employees. Pass it on. pic.twitter.com/SmhY62jhA7 ‚Äî MeidasTouch.com (@MeidasTouch) July 19, 2021 NEW: Fox News Workers Have Their Own Corporate Vaccine Passport It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúFox Clear Pass‚Äùhttps://t.co/rUQ5LkytQW ‚Äî Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) July 19, 2021 Pretty much all of their hosts outside of Tucker Carlson are shilling the vaxx now. Not only was Sean Hannity shilling it, but their daytime hosts were shilling it also. There seems to be a concerted effort today by Fox's daytime news shows to promote the vaccines to its audience. Dr. Marc Siegel says ""the Delta variant needs to be a wake-up call to get vaccinated."" Anchor John Roberts then directs viewers to the government vaccine website. pic.twitter.com/T5b21nXCfe ‚Äî Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) July 19, 2021 So Fox News has officially joined the vaxx cult. This is not shocking in the least. Outside of Tucker who will probably be forced off the network at some point, this network is really no different than CNN or MSNBC."
Senile Joe Claims Unvaxxed Americans are a Health Risk,1264,"The senile child molester Joe Biden is falsely claiming that unvaxxed Americans are a health risk. There is no evidence that unvaxxed people are a health risk to others. Biden is lying about this. He is apparently very serious about this door-to-door vaxx campaign though. There are already people talking about how this campaign is being actively rolled out. They are hiring people to visit people‚Äôs homes in order to ‚Äúeducate‚Äù them about the vaxx. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION VACCINE DOOR TO DOOR SALES PITCH SCRIPT pic.twitter.com/yiMqrKIxiv ‚Äî The_Real_Fly (@The_Real_Fly) July 9, 2021 What they are really doing is selling people on an experimental shot that has not been properly studied/tested. We‚Äôve already seen all sorts of people get really sick if not die after taking these shots. They will obviously not be sharing this information with people. The ultimate question is why there is such an interest in vaxxing as many people as possible? The most likely answer is that they want to sterilize or kill as many people as they can. That‚Äôs why the vaxx is free and why they are spending so much energy bribing or coercing people into taking it. If this continues, these people are going to threaten to put unvaxxed people in camps or they will just execute them."
UK Health Secretary Broke Lockdown Rules to Cheat on His Wife,2178,"UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was caught on video breaking coronavirus rules to cheat on his wife.

UK health minister Matt Hancock ‚Äòsorry‚Äô for breaching coronavirus guidelines by kissing aide https://t.co/HXBEbGWnzm ‚Äî SCMP News (@SCMPNews) June 25, 2021 He will apparently not be fired over this. British Prime Minister @BorisJohnson has rejected calls to fire his health secretary #MattHancock after pictures appeared of him embracing and kissing an aide in his office, in what he acknowledged was a breach of #coronavirus ruleshttps://t.co/SOc8wW3M3d ‚Äî WION (@WIONews) June 26, 2021 The most important aspect of this story is not that Hancock was cheating on his wife, it is that he like many of these virus rule enforcers around the world don‚Äôt even take their own rules seriously. They all know these rules are bullshit. A similar thing happened with Neil Ferguson who came up with the hoax model that falsely claimed millions of people were going to die from the coronavirus. He was caught breaking coronavirus restrictions to bang some fat woman. At the time, Hancock said that Ferguson should be prosecuted by police for breaking the rules. Remember: @MattHancock was so disgusted about Neil Ferguson breaking social distancing rules with a lover, that he demanded he resign and said he‚Äôd back a police prosecution. Hancock‚Äôs stinking brazen hypocrisy is outrageous & pathetic, as is @BorisJohnson‚Äôs refusal to sack him. ‚Äî Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) June 25, 2021 This is all insane, but it shows what a dumb hoax this whole thing has been. Why should anybody follow any of these rules, guidelines or whatever when the people forcing this madness on us don‚Äôt bother following those same rules? It‚Äôs all so stupid."
Healthy Utah Mom Dies After Taking COVID Vaccine,835,"Here‚Äôs another story of a healthy person taking the coronavirus vaccine and dying shortly after. Utah mother, 39, with no known health issues dies four days after receiving second dose of Moderna's vaccine https://t.co/806Y75khSQ ‚Äî Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) March 11, 2021 This entire alleged coronavirus pandemic is a hoax. The only reason people are taking the coronavirus vaccine is because they have been misled by the media, the government and pretty much every other person in the establishment. Why take a dangerous, untested vaccine to keep you safe from a virus that is no more deadly than the flu? There‚Äôs undoubtedly many other cases of people dying after taking these vaccines but since the media is so dishonest, one can only imagine what that number is. The bottom line is that you‚Äôd be insane to take this damn vaccine."
German Experts Concerned About Children‚Äôs Mental Health,2711,"The media is noting how various medical professionals in Germany are concerned about the mental health toll all these lunatic coronavirus measures are having on the youth. Of course, the media is blaming the coronavirus for causing the problems and not the insane response to it by government officials. But at least Germans are highlighting the issue. AP: Pollina Dinner returned to school in Berlin for the first time this week after two months of lockdown. The 9-year-old third-grader was thrilled to see her classmates and teachers again but frets about the coronavirus pandemic‚Äôs effect on her life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of the coronavirus, I‚Äôm afraid that everything will continue like this ‚Äî that my school will close again, I won‚Äôt be able to see my friends, and that I can‚Äôt go to the movies with my family,‚Äù the girl said, fingering her blue medical mask and sighing deeply. ‚ÄúAnd wearing this mask is even worse than all the shops being closed.‚Äù Psychiatrists, psychologists and pediatricians in Germany have voiced growing alarm that school closings, social restrictions and other precautions are magnifying the fear, disruption and stress of the pandemic among Germany‚Äôs 13.7 million children and teenagers, raising the prospect of a future mental health crisis. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any long-term studies yet, but there‚Äôs lots of anecdotal evidence of a crisis-driven rise in hospitalizations and overflowing psychologists‚Äô practices,‚Äù Julia Asbrand, a professor of child and youth psychology at Berlin‚Äôs Humboldt University, told The Associated Press. A recent survey by the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf found that about one child in three is suffering from pandemic-related anxiety or depression or is exhibiting psychosomatic symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. Children from poorer and immigrant families are disproportionally affected, according to the survey. Naturally they focus on ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äù families even though these measures are having a toll on everyone. Whatever the case, I have explained over and over again in 2020 that these lockdowns were going to be exponentially worse than the virus. I‚Äôm tired of explaining this. Where were all these experts talking about this in 2020? I‚Äôm not a medical expert or a medical professional but it didn‚Äôt take a genius to predict that a mental health crisis would be the result of all these lockdowns, forced masked-wearing etc.. These lockdowns aren‚Äôt ending. The people who implemented them are committed to continuing them until whatever insane goal they have is achieved. The only other way these end is if there‚Äôs some type of revolt and the people who implemented this insanity are put on trial for high crimes and put to death."
Biden Picks Jew Tranny As High Ranking Health Official,524,"Check out the above headline from the Times of Israel. Senile Joe has decided to appoint this Jewish tranny to be a high ranking health official. I‚Äôm sure this Jewish tranny has all sorts of great ideas to keep you healthy. This Jewish tranny looks like a very reasonable and competent person and I don‚Äôt see why anybody would question anything they do. In fact, Jewish trannies in general should not be questioned because they are among the smartest and most mentally sound people in America. This is scientifically proven."
New York: Marxist Health Inspectors Thrown Out of Gym,1305,"It looks as if some people are getting fed up with all of these insane coronavirus restrictions. A group of business owners who were meeting at a Buffalo, New York gym to figure out a plan to deal with all these coronavirus restrictions, were given a visit from the health department with some goons from the sheriff‚Äôs department. They paid them a visit despite the gym being closed. Insanely enough, one of the goons was speaking in a British accent telling them some bullshit about the law. The thing is, they did not have a warrant so they were the one‚Äôs violating the law. As a result of this, they crowd of people were able to make them leave the premises. The encounter which took place last Friday was caught on video. The footage went viral on social media and got coverage on the local television stations. This coronavirus hoax is clearly part of an agenda to destroy small businesses. We are at a point where many of them can no longer afford to go along with all of these insane restrictions. Small businesses should ignore these unconstitutional and illegal edicts and operate normally. They will receive the support of the people if they do so. People are going to prefer to do business with them than all the big box chains and stores which are going totally insane with coronavirus lunacy."
Oregon Health Official Appears as Clown to Announce Virus Deaths,1943,"A short time ago, an Oregon health official decided to dress up as a clown as she announced the daily coronavirus death toll. A senior Oregon health official wears a clown costume while announcing the daily death toll from coronavirus. https://t.co/abOHWzdlxe ‚Äî Andy Ng√¥ (@MrAndyNgo) October 28, 2020 The public announcement made by these women is one of the most bizarre things I think I‚Äôve ever seen. Not only did it feature this woman dressed up as a clown promoting virus hysteria, but there was another woman dressed up in some type of weird animal costume. She was telling people about alternatives to trick or treating which has been cancelled. Each of them would remove their mask talk and then put their mask back on when they were finished speaking. All the while, the guy doing sign language filled up half the screen. I would like to think that this incredibly strange display was done intentionally as a joke, but what‚Äôs more likely is that these women have gone insane and thought that this was a normal thing to do. This virus hoax and subsequent lockdowns have already caused people to turn to drugs and commit suicide. So it is perfectly reasonable to believe that previously normal people will lose their minds in increasingly larger numbers the longer this goes on. Plus, women generally lack self awareness to begin with and it is doubtful that they had any knowledge of clown world memes nor considered how this presentation would be perceived by a substantial portion of the audience. There is a very good chance that the people promoting this virus hysteria are themselves going crazy from the very restrictions that they are pushing on the public. After all, it isn‚Äôt like they are fully immune from them. This public announcement seems to indicate that this has already started to happen. I think we are going to see many famous and prominent people snap and behave erratically as this era of virus hysteria continues."
COVID Hospitalization Data Shows There is No Public Health Crisis,5511,"As we have documented over and over again, the hysteria surrounding the coronavirus is one of the biggest if not the biggest hoax in the history of the world. All anyone has to do is look at the actual data to see that this thing is a hoax. It isn‚Äôt that hard. The problem is that the media is not doing this and presenting data totally out of context. They have a sick agenda to scare the masses of sheep into thinking that this is the plague of death. Take in point the state by state coronavirus hospitalizations. The raw data shows that the number of people hospitalized with or from the coronavirus is a tiny fraction of the overall hospital bed capacity that is available. Below is the data updated as of September 23rd or September 24th depending on the state. Many states have minimal numbers of hospitalizations that are within the single or double digit range.

Even New York which was said to be a major hotspot for the coronavirus only has 500 active hospitalizations right now. The main reason for the initial lockdowns was because people were afraid that the hospital system could be overwhelmed. We knew months ago that this did not happen. People were filming empty hospitals everywhere. There continues to be an endless number of anecdotal reports describing empty hospitals. Take in point this one recently posted on Twitter where a man films an empty hospital in the Silver Spring, Maryland area. #adventisthealthcare hospital silver spring #maryland #WashingtonDC EMPTY! #wherearethesickpeople pic.twitter.com/kkeek9W51P ‚Äî Richard citizen journalist (@DPotcner) September 22, 2020 But despite that, we have lunatic politicians like Phil Murphy the current governor of New Jersey who is continuing to extend state of emergency orders. I‚Äôve extended the public health emergency in our state for an additional 30 days. These declarations, unless extended, expire after 30 days. This means we continue to be vigilant and prepared, and ready to act should there be a new outbreak. ‚Äî Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) September 25, 2020 This evil bastard is claiming that there is a public health emergency even though the state only has 533 hospitalizations in a state with over eight million people. These numbers also don‚Äôt differentiate between those who are hospitalized with the coronavirus versus from the coronavirus so it is safe to believe that many of these people are actually being hospitalized for something else entirely. They just happen to be hospitalized with the coronavirus and not from it. There is no reason why all these insane virus related restrictions can‚Äôt be lifted immediately. There is also no reason for healthy people to be wearing a mask everywhere they go. This is all a gigantic hoax."
Trump Rally Will Spread Deadly Virus Says ‚ÄúHealth Experts‚Äù,1328,"The media is hyping claims that Donald Trump‚Äôs upcoming rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma is dangerous and will help spread the coronavirus. This according to ‚Äúhealth experts.‚Äù AP: After months away from the campaign trail, President Donald Trump plans to rally his supporters this coming Saturday for the first time since most of the country was shuttered by the coronavirus. Trump will head to Tulsa, Oklahoma ‚Äî a state that has seen relatively few COVID-19 cases. But health experts question the decision, citing the danger of infection spreading among the crowd and sparking outbreaks when people return to their homes. The Trump campaign itself acknowledges the risk in a waiver attendees must agree to absolving them of any responsibility should people get sick. Not a problem. All Trump has to do is not call it a MAGA rally. He can say that it is a rally for social justice and to honor George Floyd, the second coming of Jesus Christ who was killed by a racist cop. Once he does that, the rally will hold no health risks. The only time there are ever coronavirus health risks are when normal people or people with right-wing political views assemble and gather. The coronavirus is of no threat to rioters, looters and people who support left-wing groups like Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist terrorists. It is simple science."
Ohio: Undercover Agents Deployed to Enforce New ‚ÄúHealth Rules‚Äù,1721,"States are just openly announcing that they are deploying secret police to ensure bars and restaurants comply with all these bizarre new health rules that nobody understands. Ohio is one of those states where this is happening. Akron Beacon Journal: As patrons potentially flock to bars and restaurants over the holiday weekend, extra undercover agents will be out to observe, educate and, if necessary, enforce the state‚Äôs public health order to thwart the spread of coronavirus. The agents are part of the Ohio Investigative Unit, which is made up of plainclothes peace officers responsible for enforcing Ohio‚Äôs alcohol, tobacco and food stamp fraud laws. Along with looking for criminal activity, the officers now are tasked with watching for potential violations of the state‚Äôs health order for restaurants and bars to safely operate during the coronavirus pandemic. The agents can issue administrative citations, which could lead to a hearing with the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. Possible penalties include fines, suspensions or even revoking a business‚Äô liquor permit. This is just state sanctioned harassment. You can pretty much bet that these secret police will only be targeting small businesses. And these are businesses that have already been financially decimated from these lockdowns. They obviously can‚Äôt afford to pay some bullshit fine but that doesn‚Äôt matter to the people who run Ohio‚Äôs state government. Ohio has an Irish-Catholic Republican governor named Mike DeWine which once again illustrates how there is a percentage of Republicans who are supporting this dumb flu hoax. This is a designed plan to kill small businesses throughout the country. There is really no denying this at this point."

Trump Defunds the World Health Organization,2485,"Much to the dismay of the nigger pictured above, Donald Trump announced today that they were defunding the World Health Organization due to their terrible handling of the coronavirus. While it remains to be seen if this is a permanent move, it is definitely a step in the right direction. The WHO not only failed to stop the spread of the coronavirus but were advocating the most ridiculous and retarded responses to the problem. They actually recommended not banning travel to China at a time when it was unclear what was going on with this thing. They also said that people shouldn‚Äôt bother wearing masks to protect themselves from infection. They literally put out a video with some retarded nigger woman telling people this. And I can only imagine what sort of bullshit they‚Äôre promoting now. This whole fiasco has shown how ineffective and ridiculous the WHO is. It‚Äôs just another useless globalist bureaucracy. The fact that they put some stupid nigger from Ethiopia in charge of it, just shows how unserious the organization is. Not surprisingly, Jews have been all over Twitter whining about their precious WHO being defunded. Just look at all these whining kikes. F‚ÄìKING LUNATIC!!! https://t.co/7EtvvqKrLc ‚Äî Fred Guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg) April 14, 2020 As usual, Trump is looking to deflect blame for his own failures. After he wasted weeks calling COVID-19 as harmless as the flu. International cooperation on public health has never been more critical. Freezing funding for the World Health Organization will only make it worse. https://t.co/EHenSBOc4X ‚Äî Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) April 14, 2020 Unacceptable.

UK: Health Secretary Threatens to Ban All Outdoor Exercise,2002,"In the United Kingdom, Health Secretary Matt Hancock who is not only a cock but also a nigger, is threatening to ban all outdoor exercise because two people he knew allegedly died from the coronavirus and this feeling he felt made him feel very sad. The Sun: MATT Hancock revealed today he‚Äôs lost two people he knows to coronavirus ‚Äì as he threatened to ban all outdoor exercise if people don‚Äôt follow the rules. After photographs of people ignoring the rules and spending their weekends lying around sunning themselves emerged, the Heath Secretary came out to remind them why Britain is in a strict lockdown. The number of deaths rose to nearly 5,000 today ‚Äì with the loss of 621 more lives. At this evening‚Äôs daily press conference he started off by telling the public he understood their pain, as two people he knew had passed away. He told the nation: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost two people that I was fond of, so I understand what a difficult time this is for the country.‚Äù He‚Äôs trying to play on people‚Äôs emotions to justify an even more draconian and retarded lockdown. Healthy people who are out exercising or sunbathing are not a threat. We already know that this virus primarily kills old people, fat people and people with pre-existing conditions. If just those people in those specific categories isolated themselves from other people, they would not have to fear getting infected by someone carrying this alleged doomsday virus. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to use the force of government to keep everybody inside of their homes over this. The entire British economy will be devastated if this continues and the consequences of that are going to be far more significant than anything this virus is going to do. I am becoming more and more convinced that we are literally witnessing the most insane event ever to take place in all of human history. Especially when we see cocksucking faggots like Matt the cock Hancock telling us he might ban people from sunbathing because of the feelings that he has felt."
Public Health ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù Attempt to Justify Prolonged Lockdown,1859,"We are now seeing so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù claim that we need to consider a prolonged lockdown because of this fake virus apocalypse situation. STAT News: Public health experts are increasingly worried that Americans are underestimating how long the coronavirus pandemic will disrupt everyday life in the country, warning that the Trump administration‚Äôs timelines are offering many a false sense of comfort. Coronavirus cases are expected to peak in mid-April in many parts of the country, but quickly reopening businesses or loosening shelter-in-place rules would inevitably lead to a new surge of infections, they said. Meanwhile, other parts of the country are only now implementing restrictions and others have not yet ordered the closure of non-essential businesses, creating a patchwork response that will slow progress toward the goal of driving down transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. At this point it looks as if the government is going to try to keep this lockdown in place as long as possible. There will be all sorts of so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù trying to justify this continued insanity. Dr. Anthony Fauci who has been one of the main government officials cheerleading this lockdown said a few days ago that we aren‚Äôt even at ‚Äúhalf-time‚Äù in fighting the doomsday virus. Dr Fauci says the US is 'not even at half-time' in the fight against coronavirus https://t.co/xJbbWslpOv ‚Äî Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) April 4, 2020 They are probably trying to buy time so they can figure out how to manage the economic fallout from this mass hysteria. But they won‚Äôt be able to keep this going forever. There are already people who have no money and no food rushing into food banks around the country. People who have no food to eat are not going to be afraid if they die of a virus. The end result of all this will be chaos and civil unrest."
Judge Says Trump Can‚Äôt Require Immigrants to Have Health Insurance,2256,"Not surprisingly, the courts have ruled that the orange man can‚Äôt force enriching vibrants to have health insurance in order to enter the country. Fox News: A federal judge in Oregon on Saturday blocked the Trump administration‚Äôs rule requiring immigrants applying for U.S. visas to prove they have health insurance or can afford medical costs from going into effect Sunday. U.S. District Judge Michael Simon granted the temporary restraining order while he considers a federal lawsuit brought Wednesday by seven U.S. citizens and a nonprofit organization, who contend the rule change would block nearly two-thirds of all prospective legal immigrants. It was not immediately clear when Simon would rule on the merits of the case. The White House announced last month that people seeking immigrant visas from abroad will be barred from entering the country unless they are to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to pay for any medical costs. The prospective measure would not apply to those already in the United States, nor would it apply to lawful permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens, the White House said. The White House said in a statement at the time the proclamation was issued that too many non-citizens were taking advantage of the country‚Äôs ‚Äúgenerous public health programs,‚Äù and said immigrants contribute to the problem of ‚Äúuncompensated health care costs.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very grateful that the court recognized the need to block the health care ban immediately,‚Äù Justice Action Center senior litigator Esther Sung said. ‚ÄúThe ban would separate families and cut two-thirds of green-card-based immigration starting tonight, were the ban not stopped.‚Äù The judge is named Simon so most likely this judge is a Jew and his ruling is certainly Jewish in nature. Basically what this ruling says is that the orange man can‚Äôt block non-Whites from entering the country for any reason. We just have to let unlimited niggers who can‚Äôt afford health care to enter America because it‚Äôd be racist not to do so. This is obviously insane. Guess this retarded ruling will have to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court."
Trump Bars Foreigners Who Don‚Äôt Have Proper Health Coverage,1118,"Donald Trump has actually implemented some pretty good policies, but many of these policies have been overturned by the Jewish court system we have. His new policy of banning foreigners who don‚Äôt have proper health coverage is a pretty good idea though. NPR: President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday barring legal immigrants who cannot prove they will have health care coverage or the means to pay for it within 30 days of their arrival to the United States. Trump said uninsured individuals are a burden on the health care industry and U.S. taxpayers. ‚ÄúImmigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our health care system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs,‚Äù Trump declared. Beginning Nov. 3, only immigrants covered by approved health insurance or those who can show they can pay for ‚Äúreasonably foreseeable medical costs‚Äù will be allowed entry into the U.S. At this point, I‚Äôm happy with any policy that will limit the number of third world invaders that come in. But we already know a bunch of Jews are going to go judge shopping and file a lawsuit to block this policy."
Foreign Invaders to Get Health Care Benefits in California,596,"California has several cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco that have enormous problems with homeless.

NYC Mayor Announces Free Healthcare for Illegal Aliens,1770,"If you are an illegal alien in New York City, Bill de Blasio has just promised that you will have access to free healthcare. USA Today: The comprehensive health care plan unveiled by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week drew applause from the Democrat‚Äôs supporters but also skepticism from those in the city who question the value and cost of the effort. De Blasio said NYC Care will provide primary and specialty care from pediatric to geriatric to 600,000 uninsured New Yorkers. De Blasio estimated the annual cost at $100 million. ‚ÄúThis is the city paying for direct comprehensive care (not just ERs) for people who can‚Äôt afford it, or can‚Äôt get comprehensive Medicaid ‚Äì including 300,000 undocumented New Yorkers,‚Äù Eric Phillips, spokesman for de Blasio, boasted on Twitter. State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican representing parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, criticized the proposal as an example of de Blasio using city coffers ‚Äúlike his personal ATM.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about instead of giving free health care to 300,000 citizens of other countries, you lower property taxes for our senior citizens who are being forced to sell the homes they‚Äôve lived in for decades because they can‚Äôt afford to pay your 44 percent increase in property taxes?‚Äù she said. It‚Äôs one thing if high taxes result in funds being provided to other Americans who are in need of assistance, but when it‚Äôs being given to foreigners and illegal aliens no less, that‚Äôs just insane. Of course this type of insanity is what the Democrat Party stands for. They don‚Äôt represent America, they are trying to destroy it and these wealth redistribution schemes are a big part of it. It‚Äôs also worth noting that De Blasio is a crazy person who fucks niggers. The man‚Äôs mind is not right."

Vaxx Said to be Useless Against New Mu Variant,2312,"After coercing people into taking a deadly vaxx to protect them from the flu, they are announcing that the deadly vaxx will not protect them from the newly discovered Mu variant. Business Insider: A new variant of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says could have the ability to evade the immunity people get from vaccines and previous infections, has been detected in almost every US state, according to data from epidemiology and genomic database Outbreak.info. Called Mu, the B.1.621 variant was first detected in Colombia in January this year. As of September 4, cases of the strain have been reported in 47 US states and the District of Columbia, Newsweek was first to report. The only states without reported cases are Nebraska, Vermont, and South Dakota, according to Outbreak.info‚Äôs data. The strain is currently most prevalent in Alaska, where data suggests that 139 reported cases account for 4 percent of the total 3,837 sequenced samples. California has the highest number in terms of raw numbers, the data show, with 232 reported cases of the B.1.621 variant out of 139,930 sequenced. This accounts for less than one percent of those sampled. The lies of this hoax are becoming increasingly incomprehensible. They‚Äôre continuing to demand people take the death shots even though they admit the death shots are totally ineffective. Countries with the highest vaxx rates now have the highest number of cases. But now they are just openly saying that the existing vaxx doesn‚Äôt work against this new Mu variant. Of course, we don‚Äôt even know if this new variant like the other variants are even real. There is no test for these different variants, so it is unknown how they are actually identifying them. You also have the issue of the tests themselves being fake. It‚Äôs just an endless layer of hoaxes on top of hoaxes. I have no idea how they are going to convince people to take these shots while admitting that they offer no protection. I guess they thought more people would have already submitted to the initial round of vaxx shots. The important thing to understand is that they are extremely interested in getting you to take a series of shots for some type of weird nefarious reason. That reason has nothing to do with your health. That‚Äôs the last thing these people care about."
Vaxxed Boxer Oscar de La Hoya in Hospital for COVID,1254,"Boxer Oscar de La Hoya who is fully vaxxed is now in the hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus.

In fact, the vaxx is causing more health problems for people than any virus. You also have the phenomenon of high vaxx rates correlating with high positive coronavirus cases. These are just objective facts. But they are not going to admit any wrongdoing. They are instead going to continue shilling indefinite shots and justifying the new shots by claiming there are new variants, mutations etc.. As we have maintained since March 2020, this coronavirus hysteria is nothing more than a fake manufactured crisis. If these hoax tests were ended and the media quit reporting case numbers, nobody would even know there was a problem. What is being called COVID-19 is just a rebranded version of the flu."
Mu Variant Expected to Kill Gazillions,1121,"Dr. WHO announced that yet another coronavirus variant has been discovered called the Mu variant. They further added that this new variant is quite resistant to the current death vaxx. Ridgefield Press:. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced this week that another variant of COVID-19, called Mu, has been identified in every U.S. state aside from Nebraska, Vermont and South Dakota. Properties in Mu could make it resistant to current vaccines, though more research is needed before this can be confirmed. WHO describes Mu‚Äôs qualities as ‚Äúa constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape.‚Äù If the experimental death vaxx can‚Äôt stop this, we are in serious trouble. This new variant will kill gazillions of people just like the delta, lambda and other variants before it which killed at least trillions based on conservative estimates. You might as well just accept that you are going to die from this very deadly virus. This is as real as it gets folks. Our only hope is if a Jewish vaxx company is able to develop a new death booster shot that will save us from this new variant."
How Did The Taliban Survive COVID-19?,1571,"Despite us being in the middle of the worst pandemic ever in the history of the world, it is truly astonishing that the Taliban were able to take over Afghanistan against a major military power. They were able to do this primarily with old Toyota pickup trucks and AK-47s. It is especially shocking since their fighters weren‚Äôt wearing pieces of cloth over their face to protect them from this very deadly COVID-19 novel coronavirus. As many of you know, the only thing that can protect you from the COVID-19 is a piece of cloth over your face. You would think that the Taliban would have been dropping like flies from this serious health crisis that has caused the entire world to close down. This shockingly did not happen. My guess is that the Taliban were able to develop a secret vaccine in the caves of Tora Bora that protected their fighters from the COVID-19. I‚Äôm talking about a real vaccine that actually works. Not the fake ineffective death shots being produced by the likes of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and other Jewish pharmaceutical companies. This is why they did not need to wear pieces of cloth over their faces while they rolled into Kabul.

He‚Äôs falsely claiming that mandatory vaxxing is the only way that everyone can be healthy. Vaccines are the best way to finish the fight against COVID-19.

Pentagon to Mandate Death Shots for Military Personnel,873,"The Pentagon is going to mandate the death shots for all military personnel. They are reportedly going to revoke the pensions and benefits of anybody who refuses to take the deadly vaxx. There is zero benefit to taking the vaxx for military personnel. These pensions and benefits will likely not even be around for them to use by the time they retire. This system is on borrowed time and is collapsing. A large segment of the military is not on board with the vaxx agenda. Many people will refuse the vaxx, go AWOL etc.. This is going to destroy military readiness which was already in a highly questionable state to begin with. Hilariously, John Kirby during his press conference today was claiming that this agenda was important to military readiness and the health of all military personnel. The exact opposite is true like pretty much everything this dumb jackoff says."
Trump Booed for Shilling Deadly Vaxx,1303,"Donald Trump was booed at his own rally in Alabama for shilling the deadly vaxx.

I have no idea why he keeps touting these death shots. Maybe he is being threatened with prison if he doesn‚Äôt do it. Or maybe he took the vaxx and the vaxx is destroying his ability to think clearly. He should be distancing himself from the vaxx instead of trying to take credit for the rollout of the vaxx. His supporters are almost entirely against the vaxx agenda so there is zero political benefit in promoting it. These shots that people are being coerced into taking are literally killing people and causing major health problems for folks. On top of that, the media is admitting that these shots have been totally ineffective. Last year when he was looking for a way out of the crisis, I could at least understand why he would support any and all options to put an end to it. But at this point, there is zero reason to be shilling any of these doom shots. The 2015 Trump is a completely different person than the 2021 Trump. His continued shilling of these death shots is simply unforgivable."
COVID Booster Shots Pushed for All Americans,1421,"They‚Äôre starting to push the idea that all Americans will need to get endless booster shots to stay safe from the fake pandemic. AP: After struggling for months to persuade Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine, U.S. health officials could soon face a fresh challenge: talking vaccinated people into getting booster shots to gain longer-lasting protection as the delta variant sends infections soaring again. As early as Wednesday, U.S. health authorities are expected to recommend an extra dose of the vaccine for all Americans eight months after they get their second shot, according to two people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. That means the biggest vaccination drive in U.S. history is about to get even more extensive. The move is being driven by both the highly contagious variant and preliminary evidence that the vaccine‚Äôs protective effect starts dropping within months. This was fairly easy to predict. That‚Äôs because this is all part of a coordinated plan designed to take your freedom and wealth. And who the hell knows what is in these shots or the ultimate reason they want everyone to take them. Whatever it is, it can‚Äôt be good based on the number of people who have gotten severely ill or died from them. Even if you take the third shot, there will be a fourth shot and a fifth shot. It is a perpetual cycle that you will never get out of."

These conflicting narratives show conclusively that this virus hysteria has been a hoax from the start. These people are not following any scientific data when making these announcements. They are promoting narratives designed to justify the creation of a dystopic control grid and rob you of all freedoms based on fear of the flu. They‚Äôve just run into a slight problem with their narrative since heavily vaxxed places have shown that they don‚Äôt stop the spread. You actually risk more damage to your health by taking the vaxx based upon all the reports we‚Äôve seen. We need mass non-compliance of any and all virus related mandates and major protests against these people. Anybody demanding you get the vaxx because of this hoax is an enemy."

Gibraltar and Iceland Show That COVID is a Hoax Without End,2828,"In many countries including the United States, they are telling everybody that the vaxx is the key to going back to normal.

Nearly its entire population has been vaxxed yet cases are skyrocketing. üá¨üáÆ By June 1st, over 99% of Gibraltar's population was fully vaccinated.

Both Gibraltar and Iceland which have achieved high vaxx totals are already pushing for more restrictions to fight phantom variants.

Austrailia: $11K Fines Proposed for Anti-Lockdown Posts,1421,"The Australian government has deployed the military to keep people locked down like they‚Äôre prisoners because one man in his 80s allegedly died of the virus. They are also looking at potentially fining people up to $11,000 for posting messages about anti-lockdown rallies. Yahoo News: There are calls for harsher penalties to combat the spread of misinformation online, including huge $11,000 fines for posting on social media, amid reports of a second anti-protest rally being planned. As Covid-19 case numbers continue to surge in NSW, the State Opposition wants tougher, targeted public health orders to crack down on anti-lockdown rally organisers and viral social media spruikers. These include $11,000 fines for people sharing information on social media about illegal rallies and inciting others to illegally attend. Under the plan, protest organisers would be slapped with whopping $20,000 fines. Unlawful attendees would face fines of $5,500, an increase from the current $1000 penalty. Shadow Police Minister Walt Secord said these fines would smash those who operate on the fringes through their anti-vaxxer and far right-wing networks. It‚Äôs pure insanity what‚Äôs happening in Australia. The good news is that there have been large protests against this madness.

WaPo Says It is Time For People to Prove They‚Äôre Vaxxed,1772,"The Washington Post has published an article talking about how it is no big deal for you to show proof that you are vaxxed to simply live a normal life.

The good news is that the vaxx passport system hasn‚Äôt really been rolled out in America as of yet. There‚Äôs some select places where this is starting to happen, but they haven‚Äôt really made their big push yet. Make no mistake though, the plan is to definitely push it down our throats at some point in the future. My only guess as to why they haven‚Äôt done this yet is because they are hoping that more Americans will take the vaxx as they try to get the system fully installed in Europe. Right now roughly half of the US population has not been vaxxed which makes it more difficult for them to implement. There are also many areas around the country where the vast majority of people are unvaxxed. Those areas are going to have people who are not going to be keen on adopting this evil system."

It is just unfortunate that Odenkirk will probably not speak out about this because he knows he‚Äôd risk losing his acting career if he did. The thing is, his career won‚Äôt mean anything if the vaxx ends up killing him."

Surgeon General Backs COVID Discussion Censorship,1201,"See the picture of the shit-skinned asshole above? That is Vivek Murthy the United States Surgeon General who was appointed by the Jewish-controlled regime of Joe Biden. He is actively backing any and all censorship of discussion pertaining to the coronavirus and the coronavirus vaxx. He claims that censorship is needed because of ‚Äúequity.‚Äù I have no idea what that even means. I doubt he even knows what it means. He‚Äôs basically arguing that censorship is needed to protect people‚Äôs health which is the dumbest argument imaginable. When you limit people‚Äôs access to information, you put people‚Äôs health in jeopardy because they are unable to make complete and informed decisions. The coronavirus vaxx is a perfect example of it. Lots of people have taken the vaxx without having 100 percent knowledge or understanding about it. Many have been bribed or coerced into taking it without the full facts. The end result is that many people have died or have had their health severely impacted from the vaxx and this information is being deliberately hidden from people. Murthy is a criminal and he should be charged with high crimes for his role in promoting this deranged virus system that is emerging."
"Whistleblower Says At Least 45,000 Died From the Vaxx",2651,"A whistleblower inside the government is saying that at least 45,000 people in the United States alone have died from the vaxx. USA üá∫üá∏ Here we go. A whistleblower has some shocking information. As we've suspected, it would seem The Govt and Pharma has been lying. There are at least, 45k deaths in the USA alone.

The whistleblower is someone who does healthcare analytics for the government. This is what she said. It is my professional estimate that VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) database, while extremely useful, is under-reported by a conservative factor of at least 5. On July 9, 2021, there were 9,048 deaths reported in VAERS. I verified these numbers by collating all of the data from VAERS myself, not relying on a third party to report them. In tandem, I queried data from CMS medical claims with regard to vaccines and patient deaths, and have assessed that the deaths occurring within 3 days of vaccination are higher than those reported in VAERS by a factor of at least 5. This would indicate the true number of vaccine-related deaths was at least 45,000. Put in perspective, the swine flu vaccine was taken off the market which only resulted in 53 deaths. There is literally no reason for this person to lie about these numbers. What would be the incentive for her to do so? She is opening herself up to all sorts of bad things being done to her for having the courage to speak out on the data. Besides, we have seen all sorts of stories reported on social media about people dying right after taking the vaxx. This includes a number of prominent people. The vaxx is absolutely killing people, we just don‚Äôt know exactly how many because the government is doing everything in their power to not accurately track what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs also worth noting that only a small fraction of the vaxx deaths ever get reported n the VAERS. This has been true for other inoculations and it is true for the covid jab. So what this means is that the true number of deaths from the vaxx is very likely in the hundreds of thousands if not millions in America alone. This is probably why there is such a major push to censor anybody raising any questions about the vaxx. This thing has caused so much death and damage that they are doing everything they can to cover it up. It‚Äôs why they are just openly working with tech companies to censor discussion about this under the guise of it allegedly being ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù"
Vaxxed Covidiots Developing Auto-Immune Disorders,1292,"Even the federal government is being forced to admit that people are having health problems with these experimental coronavirus shots.

The fact of the matter is that nobody knows what the hell these shots are going to do to people over time. We do know however that the short term impacts have not been good based on the adverse reactions people have reported both online and through official channels. What I find funny is how the people who rushed out to get this experimental shot called people like myself ‚Äúcovidiots‚Äù for exposing the fact that this whole thing has been a retarded hoax to implement a deranged global control system. We‚Äôll see who gets the last laugh when more and more of these vaxxed morons start having major health problems. They‚Äôre going to wish they listened to us."

Jew CDC Director: Vaxxing 1 Million Teens Will Prevent 1 Death,1306,"Rochelle Walensky the Jewish Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that we could prevent one death if a million teenagers get the vaxx.

UK: Half of Recent COVID Deaths Were Vaxxed,2489,"The Wall Street Journal just put out a report talking about how half of the recent deaths attributed to the coronavirus were people who got the vaxx. WSJ: As the Delta variant of the coronavirus surges through the U.K., almost half of the country‚Äôs recent Covid-19 deaths are of people who have been vaccinated. But doctors and scientists aren‚Äôt sounding the alarm about the apparently high proportion of deaths among the vaccinated population. On the contrary, they say the figures so far offer reassurance that vaccines offer substantial protection against the variant, particularly after two doses. Delta, first identified in India, has since spread to at least 85 countries, including the U.S., where it is now estimated to be the most common variant. This hoax has gotten so ridiculous and absurd, nobody has any idea what is actually going on. The only thing that is clear is that there has never been any new deadly virus. This has all been the result of manipulated tests, manipulated statistics and propaganda being spread by the liars in the media and government. We do know however, that the vast majority of people who reportedly died from the coronavirus, died from something completely unrelated. We are talking about people with preexisting conditions or people who were old. It‚Äôs no different than what we‚Äôve seen with the flu year after year. The government has just decided to label deaths differently and attribute them to the coronavirus in the name of pushing this gay hoax. Plus, we know there are all sorts of health complications including death that have been the result of these weird shots that people have been bribed or coerced into taking. So there‚Äôs also a good chance that a good chunk of these deaths were from the vaxx itself. Whatever the case, why would you take the vaxx when you hear news like this? If you take this news at face value, it indicates that the vaxx is worthless and does not provide adequate protection against this allegedly deadly virus. Then you have stories like this jackoff BBC propagandist catching the coronavirus after being double vaxxed. BBC's Andrew Marr on catching Covid after being double vaccinated https://t.co/7rXxzA8prU ‚Äî BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) June 28, 2021 The bottom line is that you‚Äôd be insane to take the vaxx at this point.

He also documented how there were all sorts of closed businesses and signs of general economic ruin. It‚Äôs a crisis worse than what you‚Äôd see in third world countries. As a result of this, the city government wants to make it illegal for homeless people to pitch tents.

All these people living on the streets in such filthy conditions is not good for public health. Unfortunately, it is only going to get worse. You are going to see more people forced out of their homes because they can‚Äôt pay their back rent and they will end up on the streets.

Stanford Scientist Shills ‚ÄúSuperhero‚Äù Vaxx,2198,"A Stanford scientist is shilling some type of future ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù vaxx which he expects will be rolled out over the next ten years. He is claiming that this will provide people some type of wonderful genetic upgrade of some kind. Study Finds: A groundbreaking ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù vaccine inspired by the DNA code of Olympic athletes could help transform society over the next decade, a top genetic scientist claims. The vaccine would provide lifelong protection against three of the top ten leading causes of death, according to Euan Ashley, professor of medicine and genetics at Stanford University. The so-called ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù jab could offer simultaneous, long-term protection against heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and liver disease, thanks to advances in genetic engineering. This breakthrough treatment would deliver the blueprint of ‚Äúideal‚Äù cells from men and women whose genes are more disease-resistant than those of the average person, together with an ‚Äúinstruction manual‚Äù to help the body ‚Äúrepair, tweak and improve‚Äù its own versions. A single dose could lead to a ‚Äúbody-wide genetic upgrade‚Äù that would cut the risk of premature death in some adults by as much as 50 percent. What‚Äôs happened is that these experimental coronavirus mRNA shots have opened the door for a widespread genetic engineering program. They will coerce or bribe people into taking these injections by claiming that it is for your own good and the health of those around you. But these are the same people who have purposefully destroyed the economy with lockdowns, forced people to wear masks against their will because of the flu etc.. If they were willing to do these insane things, it is safe to guess that anything they push on the public will not be in their best interests. The fact of the matter is that we don‚Äôt know the ultimate impacts of these mRNA shots, although we have seen some of the immediate impacts. Many people have died or have suffered terrible ailments from them. Whatever this weird agenda is about, it is not good. I‚Äôd rather be shot dead than to take any of these weird injections these people are shilling. I don‚Äôt care if they claim it is some type of ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù shot or whatever."

UK Government Ran Secret Coronavirus ‚ÄúExercise‚Äù in 2016,5341,"According to the Guardian, the British government ran a secret coronavirus ‚Äúexercise‚Äù called ‚ÄúExercise Alice‚Äù back in 2016. Guardian: The government ran an exercise modelling the impact of a coronavirus outbreak four years before the Covid-19 outbreak but tried to keep it secret, the Guardian has learned. The previously unpublicised Exercise Alice took place in 2016 involving officials from Public Health England (PHE) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), and envisioned an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which is caused by a coronavirus. It was one of 10 previously unpublicised pandemic planning exercises in the five years before Covid-19, now disclosed under freedom of information legislation. PHE had previously declined to reveal details of the exercises, citing the need to safeguard national security. A leading virologist said Exercise Alice could have been ‚Äúcompletely relevant‚Äù to the Covid response, which in the first weeks was shaped by flu pandemic plans. Separately, a senior government adviser on respiratory disease described it as ‚Äúodd‚Äù that details of the exercises had not been provided to key advisory committees. Last October when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, published a report on Exercise Cygnus, a 2016 flu pandemic scenario, he told parliament: ‚ÄúExercise Cygnus was not designed to consider other potential pandemics, or to identify what action could be taken to prevent widespread transmission.‚Äù Moosa Qureshi, a hospital consultant who obtained the information, said MPs should ask the health secretary why he ‚Äúfailed to disclose to parliament that the government has modelled multiple other pandemics, including a coronavirus‚Äù. Hancock faces cross-examination by MPs on Thursday who have already heard claims from the prime minister‚Äôs former chief adviser Dominic Cummings that assurances he received that pandemic planning was up to date were ‚Äúcompletely hollow‚Äù. As recently as March, PHE refused to name the exercises or say what they were about, but it released information when challenged in May by Qureshi. Other exercises include three on Ebola, four on pandemic influenza, two on Lassa, an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, three on bird flu and one that dealt with a radiation incident, nicknamed Exercise Cerberus. The public health body is now facing calls to publish the reports on the exercises and share them with experts. ‚ÄúIf there were so many exercises, it‚Äôs odd to me that the results were not provided to advisory committees,‚Äù said Prof Peter Openshaw, a respiratory physician and mucosal immunologist at Imperial College London who is a member of the government‚Äôs Nervtag committee, which advises on new and emerging respiratory virus threats. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised not to have seen the results. Openness and disclosure has historically been associated with benefits rather than detriments.‚Äù Openshaw said the reports on the exercises could be very valuable. He said Mers, like Covid, was caused by a coronavirus but the extent to which the exercise might have provided lessons for the current pandemic would depend on what assumptions were made about case fatality, route and speed of transmission, speed of diagnosis and the rate of asymptomatic infection. Dr David Matthews, a reader in virology at Bristol University who studies coronaviruses, said the Mers exercise ‚Äúwould have been completely relevant‚Äù to the Covid-19 response. ‚ÄúIf there was a Mers playbook, that should have been dusted off,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut who at PHE knew and how far was it shared among the government? The question is what was done with this at the beginning of the pandemic.‚Äù This just provides further proof that this entire coronavirus situation is a massive hoax. There is no legitimate explanation as to why this type of exercise would need to be run in secret and under the guise of national security. You would only do this if you were planning to hoax the public and that this was part of the preparation for said hoax. We‚Äôve already known about the Bill Gates funded Event 201, a coronavirus simulation which was ran shortly prior to the coronavirus hysteria. Both ‚ÄúExercise Alice‚Äù and Event 201 were obviously part of the planning phase of this hoax. We‚Äôll likely learn more about the preparation for this hoax moving forward, but what else do we really need to know? We already knew this entire thing has been a scam for a variety of reasons. Throughout 2020 at the height of this alleged pandemic, people documented how hospitals were mostly all empty. We also knew that the actual number of deaths in 2020 was not abnormally different from any other year prior to that. On top of that, all of the responses to this alleged virus of doom were dumped on to the public as part of a very weird advertising and propaganda campaign. The social distancing, masks, vaccine passports, lockdowns, quarantining of healthy people etc.. did not just come out of the ether. It was part of a carefully crafted plan that appears to have been years in the making. They‚Äôre still not done with this hoax either, as they‚Äôre talking about coronavirus variants, booster shots and other insane nonsense. They just plan on using features of the coronavirus hoax and mixing it in with other fake engineered hoax crises in order to fully implement a dystopic beast system of some kind."

It is just a terrible website that ruins the mental health of its users. There is nothing about it that is good for society or the world in general. Whatever the case, I‚Äôm sure once this ban is over, they‚Äôll find another reason to ban him again. The ban might as well just be permanent."
Roughly Half of FDA & NIH Workers Unvaccinated,1261,"Key members of the virus regime including Anthony Fauci testified in front of the Senate recently. It was discovered per Fauci‚Äôs own testimony that about half of his own employees are unvaccinated. Same goes for the FDA. This is amazing. Almost 1/2 the employees at @us_fda and @NIAIDNews (Fauci‚Äôs institute) have NOT been vaccinated. https://t.co/RsBosnPDes ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) May 14, 2021 This is interesting considering that Fauci and others who are part of this weird virus regime, have claimed that people who don‚Äôt get vaxxed are conspiracy theorists and deniers of science. So how is it that half the people at both the FDA and NIH fall into this category? Wouldn‚Äôt Fauci want to fire all of these science deniers? Based on this, you have to conclude that these people are unwilling to take this strange shot and have serious questions about their safety. It makes the constant vaccine shilling all the more intolerable and proves that these people who are shilling these shots are not doing it because they care about our health. If these people actually cared about the general health of the American people, they would want to have an open and honest conversation about these shots. They obviously do not want to have such a conversation."
Fauci Wants to Vax Six-Month-Olds,1277,"The lying fraud Anthony Fauci was on Jewish CNN the other day talking about how he wants to give six-month-old babies the coronavirus shots.

There is no reason to vaccinate young people let alone infants for a virus that over 99.99 percent of people easily survive. Especially when young people have the highest survival rate. Not to mention the fact that there have been all sorts of adverse reactions that people have experienced from these shots. People have been seriously damaged and even died after taking them. There are also no guarantees that the vaccines will keep you safe from the virus. Numerous people have tested positive for the virus after they‚Äôve gotten the shot. Whatever Fauci‚Äôs agenda is to shill these weird shots, it is not a good one. He does not care about your personal health let alone the health of these infants who he wants to shoot up with these experimental gene therapy injections."
Ohio Governor Launches Special Lottery for the Vaxxed,828,"If you‚Äôd like to sell your soul and take a weird gene therapy shot at a chance to win $1 million, you are in luck.

Gates-Backed Institute Claims 900K+ COVID Deaths in US,2339,"The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an organization backed by Bill Gates, has made a change to their COVID model and are now claiming that over 900,000 people in the United States have died from the coronavirus. This is over 300,000 higher than official numbers which are highly suspect in their own right. This morning, we're releasing a major change in our COVID-19 model (‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/5biAggRz1T).

So obviously these people have an incentive to make this coronavirus hoax seem like it was a real pandemic. These people are just pulling numbers out of their ass. Claiming that over 900,000 people died of this is insane. Hospitals were given financial incentives to mark all sorts of different deaths as COVID deaths. This was fully admitted by Deborah Birx during a press conference last year. She specifically said that the death total included people who tested positive for the coronavirus even if it wasn‚Äôt what ultimately caused the death. On top of that, the testing for the coronavirus has been totally unreliable. There‚Äôs numerous stories about false positives and assorted fuckery with these testing kits. Also, if there was a real pandemic, we would have seen all sorts of people in hospitals being treated for the coronavirus around the country. Instead what we saw were empty hospitals and empty tents everywhere. The big navy ship and the field hospital that Donald Trump setup in New York City were empty during the height of the so-called crisis last year. This whole thing has been a massive hoax and these assholes are fudging numbers with their bullshit model to justify why all these lunatic lockdowns were put into place. They‚Äôre simply trying to cover their own ass. These people should be arrested for crimes."
NJ Governor Bribing People With Beer to Take Doom Shot,893,"New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy an insane asshole who looks like he fucks children at pizza parties, is literally bribing people with beer to take these experimental gene therapy shots.

Plus anything Phil Murphy endorses you should be skeptical about because he is a big dumb poop head."
CNN Demands People Be Coerced Into Taking COVID Shots,1072,"CNN wants the government and corporations to coerce people into taking these experimental COVID shots by punishing those who refuse to take it.

The idea being that you will not be able to fully participate in society if you don‚Äôt get one of these weird shots. You‚Äôll be rendered a second or third class citizen. It‚Äôs a highly disturbing situation. They are also likely to blame people who haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated for the reason why various restrictions haven‚Äôt been lifted. But whatever the case, there is nothing these people can do to coerce me into taking one of these fucked up shots."
Joe Biden Bans Travel From India,4050,"Joe Biden has announced a travel ban on India because of the reported problems they are having with the coronavirus. While I have no problem with Biden banning people from India coming here, it is funny to see this considering Biden and the entire Jew system was calling Donald Trump an evil gook-hater and a bigot for banning travel from China and other parts of the world in early 2020. BREAKING REPORT: Biden to BAN FLIGHTS from India to the United States‚Ä¶ Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Biden call TRUMP A XENOPHOBIC FEAR-MONGER for banning Flights from China? ‚Äî Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) April 30, 2021 As Biden bans flights from India, perhaps he should be reminded of a tweet he put out last year. Also, I thought travel bans were xenophobic. pic.twitter.com/9Dc0Bzl3Ac ‚Äî Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) April 30, 2021 This just shows that this decision was made with ulterior motives in mind. It is honestly hard to say exactly how bad the problem is in India. From what I can tell, there is an increase in deaths but these deaths are not from the coronavirus, they are instead from the vaccines that just got rolled out. They‚Äôre obviously not going to admit this due to the global agenda to get as many people to take these strange shots. So any increase in deaths will just be blamed on a new mutant strain or variant of the coronavirus. Of course, India is a big country and lots of people die every day there so the increase in deaths is probably being exaggerated a bit. But this decision to ban travel from India does not have anything to do with health and safety. If they actually cared about health and safety, the border with Mexico would not be wide open right now. It is instead a political agenda at play to highlight this crisis and put pressure on the political leadership of India‚Äôs government. The entire global ZOG media system is putting out all sorts of negative articles trashing the sitting Indian government. Arrogance, hyper-nationalism and bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis of epic proportions in India, with its crowd-loving PM basking while citizens suffocate. This is the story of how it all went so terribly wrong #coronavirus https://t.co/bL8VXkz5RD ‚Äî The Australian (@australian) April 25, 2021 A very disturbing source-based report from Reuters.

This presumably is meant to change the government. Biden‚Äôs travel ban is just meant to bolster the belief that the problem in India is a very serious one and that the government is doing a bad job. It‚Äôs also very possible that the Modi government is not fully on board with what ZOG is doing and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre trying to force him out. Modi had a close relationship with Donald Trump and that might be another explanation as to why they want him gone. You also have the fact that¬†hydroxychloroquine the anti-malaria drug is widely available in India and was apparently used to effectively treat the coronavirus. Whatever the case, they‚Äôre not telling you the real reasons why they‚Äôre banning travel from India."
Joe Rogan Takes Back Anti-Vaccine Comments,1836,"A few days back, Joe Rogan expressed a healthy skepticism about these coronavirus shots stating that young and healthy people shouldn‚Äôt bother getting them. JOE ROGAN: ‚ÄúI think it's safe to get vaccinated. But if you're 21 years old‚Ä¶ if you are a healthy person and you're exercising all the time and you're young and you're eating well, I don't think you need to worry about this.""
pic.twitter.com/SUn39qOJ0R ‚Äî Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 27, 2021 His original statement was accurate. There is no reason to take an experimental gene therapy shot to keep you safe from something that has such a high survivability rate. His skepticism was met with outrage from the ZOG system. So as a result, he meekly backtracked from his original statement saying that he‚Äôs not a doctor and not qualified to be giving medical advice. He further added that people should listen to everything Anthony Fauci says and that young people should get these mystery shots. I‚Äôm paraphrasing a bit, but that‚Äôs the basic gist of what he said. Rogan is nothing more than a bought and paid for shill, so it is not surprising to see him backtrack like this. You may recall that he struck a $100 million deal with Spotify to have exclusive rights to his podcast. When he struck that deal, he sold his soul with it. They were giving Rogan this money in order to control him and his content. Many of his old shows with various right-wing figures have been removed from the archives. This situation is just another example of how his content is being controlled. His comments obviously angered his masters so he was ordered to issue this ‚Äúclarification.‚Äù The bottom line is that no amount of money is worth selling your soul over. I‚Äôd rather die penniless than sell my soul to shill any sort of ZOG vaccine propaganda. Rogan is a very sad and pathetic individual."
India: COVID Deaths Surge After Vaccine Rollout,2398,"India is reportedly seeing a major surge in COVID deaths. India, home to the world's worst ongoing coronavirus outbreak, has reported more than 17.6 million cases since the pandemic began last year. But the real number, experts fear, could be up to 30 times higher ‚Äî meaning more than half a billion cases. https://t.co/lJlBed2nOz ‚Äî CNN International (@cnni) April 27, 2021 The deaths seem to be real. Indians have been sharing pictures of bodies getting burned in mass, although it is not clear if these photos are connected to these deaths. But what is curious is how this massive surge in deaths has come right after the roll out of Covaxin which is an Indian COVID shot. Despite this disturbing correlation, Anthony Fauci has been shilling the vaccine. Dr Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to the White House, backs India‚Äôs homegrown vaccine #Covaxin, says it neutralises the 617 variant https://t.co/d0SsPmo84R ‚Äî Minhaz Merchant (@MinhazMerchant) April 28, 2021 But why would there be a sudden rise in deaths after the launch of the vaccine? Are we supposed to believe this is just a coincidence? Logic would dictate that the two events are correlated. On top of this, an Indian actor who was helping the government shill pro-vaccine propaganda, actually died one day after taking the vaccine. #Vivek#ripvivek Well known Indian actor and the Tamilnadu state‚Äôs ambassador for creating public health messages has passed away a day after he received the #COVID19 vaccine. https://t.co/gTg3fPre7T ‚Äî GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) April 17, 2021 A video of an Indian man questioning all of this to members of the Indian news media has been heavily censored on social media. You should be able to view that here as Twitter and I assume other social media sites have blocked people from sharing the video. He was raising all the same questions I‚Äôve been raising about the coronavirus hoax, masks, these weird shots etc.. It appears as if they‚Äôre going to blame all of these deaths on the coronavirus even though it is much more likely that they are dying from the shots. We haven‚Äôt seen this type of mass death during this entire virus hoax. The only thing that has changed are these weird shots that people are taking. This whole situation is completely insane. At this point, anybody who takes these shots is stupid or suicidal. There is more than enough reason to be questioning their safety."

Alex Berenson noted that cases of well-known people dying shortly after getting the shot have been frequent since these shots have been introduced. So another well-known person in his forties ‚Äì not a true celebrity, but someone with a sizable Twitter following ‚Äì ‚Äúdied suddenly‚Äù Friday. No cause of death given, and his family wants privacy. These cases have popped with disturbing frequency since December. ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 25, 2021 The problem that we have here is that there is no open and honest conversation about these shots. I mean, is it possible that Kaminsky didn‚Äôt die of the shot? Sure, it is possible, but it is also possible that the shot killed him. If we can‚Äôt have an honest conversation about this topic, how do we know for sure? The people pushing these shots on the population obviously don‚Äôt want to have an honest conversation. Therefore, without an honest conversation, it is logical to be skeptical about this agenda and the safety of these shots."
Rapper DMX Dies After Reportedly Taking COVID Vaccine,2915,"Rapper DMX has passed away at the age of 50. A family member has reportedly said that he had taken the COVID shot just a short time before he was hospitalized for a heart attack. IBTimes: The rumours died a natural death after doctors revealed the singer needs to undergo brain tests that would ‚Äúdictate further decisions to be made by DMX‚Äôs family.‚Äù Now, one of the rapper‚Äôs close family members revealed that he doubts if DMX suffered a heart attack due to drug overdose and revealed that the singer received Covid-19 vaccine about a week before he got the heart attack. The family member did not confirm that the vaccine got the singer down but stated that it might have been the cause for his heart attack. ‚Äù(DMX) got the vaccine when they opened it up to people over 50. He got it so that he could go travel and perform, stuff like that,‚Äù the family member said in a statement. He stated that he suspects the vaccine might have caused a negative reaction on the rapper‚Äôs body leading him to be hospitalized a week later. ‚ÄùHe took that vaccine, and he had a heart attack. I‚Äôm not saying the vaccine did it, but he never had a heart attack before,‚Äù the statement read and further stated that his body might have had a ‚Äúreaction to the vaccine‚Äù. Also, the name of the vaccine which DMX reportedly took has not been revealed. The statement also said the family member was ‚Äúfurious‚Äù when reports about his drug overdose was all over the news and said if that was indeed true, the doctors would have made it public. ‚ÄùEveryone keeps saying that (DMX) had a drug overdose. How do they know? I‚Äôm in the family and no doctor told me anything about an overdose. Yes he had past issues with drugs. But nobody knows that he had an OD. It‚Äôs f*****d up that its being reported like that,‚Äù he said. There were all sorts of reports in the Jewish media claiming that DMX was hospitalized from a drug overdose. They obviously would rather people think that DMX died from drugs than the coronavirus shot. They‚Äôre not going to be able to convince everybody of this narrative though. I‚Äôm hearing DMX received the #COVID19 vaccine just a week before his heart attack. Anyone else hearing this? ‚Äî Aubrey Huff (@aubrey_huff) April 9, 2021 And while we don‚Äôt know 100 percent that DMX had the shot and died from it, it is not an implausible scenario considering all the other prominent people that have died after taking it. You would think at this point that blacks would be much more skeptical about the coronavirus shots. Prominent blacks keep dropping dead after they have either confirmed to have taken the shot or reportedly taken the shot. Of course, people of all races are reporting a variety of health issues after taking the shot. Seems to me that nobody should be taking these shots unless you have a death wish. These shots are much more dangerous than the coronavirus which is no more dangerous than any other flu variant."
COVID Vaccination Site Closed After Adverse Reactions,1454,"A mass coronavirus vaccination site was closed after a number of people reported all sorts of adverse reactions to the shots.

But people are generally stupid and will just go along with whatever any authority figure says. They don‚Äôt even consider that what the authority figure or group could be pushing them to do things that against their interests. As I‚Äôve said over and over again, these shots haven‚Äôt been properly tested and there have been all sorts of adverse reactions to them including the shots causing people to die. We have no idea what the long term health impacts are with these things. You also have people in the media shilling this nonsense by allegedly getting their shots on television. One of the most cringeworthy episodes of this I‚Äôve seen was on the TODAY show where all the anchors recently got their experimental gene therapy shots as soon as they were eligible. The purpose of this is to make weak minded people think they‚Äôre being left out by not getting these shots. The whole thing is insane. If you draw a line anywhere, you need to draw it here. Do not get these shots regardless of the consequences."
Canada: COVID Cops Attempt to Shut Down Easter Service,1795,"The coronavirus hoax has been used by governments as justification to close down churches.

While I disagree with his ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù comparison, he was absolutely correct and right to kick out these thug cops. They had no right to do what they were doing.

The vast majority of churches have sheepishly gone along with this gay hoax and voluntarily closed up shop even a year into this insanity. Resistance has been minimal among churches and various Christian institutions. Quite honestly, Christian churches and the various denominations of Christianity have been subverted and have failed their followers. They have utterly failed to resist all of the anti-Christian bullshit we‚Äôve seen pushed through by Western governments for decades. Even as governments are sending goons to close down churches, we aren‚Äôt seeing any sort of organized pushback. So now we are at a point where the global virus regime has normalized police shutting down church services because of a virus that over 99.99 percent of people survive. Outside of a few minor exceptions like what we saw with this pastor, organized Christianity has become a joke. They‚Äôve stood for nothing and continue to stand for nothing."

But there is a weird agenda at play to get as many people as possible to take these strange gene-altering shots. One of the ways in which they are trying to do this is is to prevent people from having access to certain parts of society if you don‚Äôt get the shot. What Rutgers is doing is just a preview of what we will see other mainstream institutions do. They‚Äôll prevent you from being able to do normal things without proof of vaccination etc.. How far they‚Äôll be able to push this is not known, but they‚Äôll try to push it to the limit for sure. But unless you plan on studying something in the STEM fields and maybe a handful of other disciplines, there really is no reason to go to college in this current era. Especially at a school that makes you take one of these bizarre shots. What Rutgers is doing is highly immoral and highly unethical. Who the hell are they to push collective medicine on people? It‚Äôs no different than this collective pushing of masks on everybody regardless of their personal health situation. It‚Äôs evil and it is wrong."
Bill Gates Claims We‚Äôll Be Back to Normal By End of 2022,1566,"The sadistic evil lunatic Bill Gates is claiming that we should be back to normal by the end of 2022 thanks to all of these experimental mRNA vaccines he has championed. Reuters: The world should be back to normal by the end of 2022 thanks to COVID-19 vaccines, Bill Gates said in an interview for Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and television broadcaster TVN24. ‚ÄúThis is an incredible tragedy,‚Äù the Microsoft co-founder said on the pandemic, adding that the only good news was the access to vaccines. ‚ÄúBy the end of 2022 we should be basically completely back to normal,‚Äù Gates said. Gates, a billionaire who stepped down as chairman of Microsoft Corp in 2014, has through his philanthropic Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed at least $1.75 billion to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes support for some makers of vaccines, diagnostics and potential treatments. I can assure you that things will not be fully back to normal by 2022. The world as it existed before March 2020 is not coming back. This insane virus hoax and the insane responses to it have created untold economic, psychological and societal damage that won‚Äôt be undone for a very long time. In fact, the damage might not be undone in many of our lifetimes. Even if all the lockdowns and mask bullshit was ended tomorrow, repairing things would take a very long time.

Unfortunately, I doubt the Jewish-controlled regime of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will push this agenda forward. From what I‚Äôve been reading, this Arab came from Syria and had mental health problems. No doubt these mental health problems were exacerbated by the lockdowns and other insanity we‚Äôve seen over the past year. The mass shooting is the end result. There‚Äôs undoubtedly going to be many more of these incidents moving forward as people lose hope and lose their will to live under this new global virus/climate change regime that is emerging. But this whole incident is really the product of mass immigration into America. There was no reason for this individual to be here."
California and Florida Had Similar COVID Death Rates,1364,"The coronavirus is nothing more than a variation of the flu if not the flu. It has a survivability rate well over 99.99 percent. There is no pandemic. The whole thing is a hoax. But with that said, the lockdowns which were meant to save lives from this allegedly deadly plague, did nothing to help. As I‚Äôve been saying for the past year or so, the lockdowns were going to create much more damage to people‚Äôs health and this is absolutely what has happened. On top of that, the alleged COVID death rate in California and in Florida are the same. This despite California doing all sorts of crazy lockdown nonsense whereas Florida largely kept its state open. We blew it, hard. California COVID death rate: 0.146% Florida COVID death rate: 0.155% These numbers are statistically tied. Yet, FL's economy is open, kids are in school, Disney World entertaining tourists. CA's business are closed & kids are depressed and falling behind. ‚Äî Doug Ludlow (@dougludlow) March 19, 2021 It shows that these lockdowns have done nothing to stop the spread of the coronavirus. You can make the same argument about forcing healthy people to wear a mask. It‚Äôs all bullshit. The political actors like California Governor Gavin Newsom who put these measures into place deserve to be hung by their neck until they suffer death. This would be proceeded with a very fair trial of course."
Ex-Boxer Marvin Hagler Dead After Taking COVID Vaccine,1413,"Another famous black athlete has apparently died after taking the coronavirus vaccine. You may remember that Hall of Fame baseball player Hank Aaron died after taking the coronavirus vaccine a few months ago. Now boxing great Marvin Hagler has reportedly died after taking the vaccine. Hammering Hank Aaron‚Ä¶now Marvelous Marvin Hagler two legends dead after taking the #covid19 vaccine. ‚Äî Aubrey Huff (@aubrey_huff) March 14, 2021 People are saying that this story is not confirmed.

"JewTube Removes 800,000 Videos for COVID ‚ÄúMisinformation‚Äù",1352,"The Jewish video sharing website known as YouTube has admittedly removed 800,000 videos for containing what they say is coronavirus ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù BBC: YouTube has removed more than 30,000 misleading Covid-19 vaccination videos in the past five months, it said. A YouTube spokeswoman said the videos contradicted vaccine information from the World Health Organization (WHO) or health authorities such as the NHS. In October, it banned vaccine misinformation in a bid to clamp down on attempts to discredit the jabs. It added that in the past year, it had removed more than 800,000 videos for coronavirus misinformation. That figure covers more than just vaccines, but wider ‚Äúmedically unsubstantiated‚Äù claims about the virus. What YouTube says is ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù is actually just content that disputes the establishment narrative regarding the coronavirus and coronavirus vaccines. If you do not agree that the coronavirus is a death plague and that the only solution is to wear masks, stay locked in your house and take a rushed vaccine that has not been properly tested, your content will be banned on YouTube. YouTube is effectively promoting lies and misinformation by claiming that people who correct this misinformation are the ones spreading misinformation. The Jews who run this website are truly evil people who belong in the pits of hell."
World Economic Forum Says Lockdowns Improving Cities,1736,"The World Economic Forum put out a tweet claiming that lockdowns are improving cities around the world even though that is obviously not the case. They were somehow claiming that the lockdowns helped with the climate change hoax and that this is why cities were improving. Obviously this talking point is insane as lockdowns have totally destroyed city life and people are fleeing places like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York in droves. Many American cities have been turned into third world shitholes because of these lockdowns. The tweet was so ridiculous they deleted it and admitted that cities were not improving from the lockdowns. But they went on to justify these tyrannical lockdowns by falsely claiming that they have been an important part of the public health response to the coronavirus. We‚Äôre deleting this tweet. Lockdowns aren‚Äôt ‚Äúquietly improving cities‚Äù around the world. But they are an important part of the public health response to COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/D2Pyb9x4yy ‚Äî World Economic Forum (@wef) February 27, 2021 This is also a lunatic statement. The lockdowns are not an important part of the public health response to the coronavirus because it has been proven that the lockdowns did not stop the spread of the coronavirus. In fact, places that did not do lockdowns actually had less problems with the coronavirus spreading. The lockdowns have also caused infinitely more health problems as they have caused depression, suicide, drug use and other bad things to skyrocket. Not to mention all the other social and economic consequences we have witnessed. It‚Äôs just nuts that these people can put out allegedly serious statements like this even when such statements are completely divorced from reality."
Israel Has Setup a Vaccine Passport System,1393,"In Israel, the Jews have setup a system where you need to have had a coronavirus vaccine or be declared immune to visit cafes, gyms, theaters, hotels and basically live any sort of normal life.

Considering the World Economic Forum is basically promoting this diabolical and evil system, it is pretty safe to assume that this type of thing will be rolled out everywhere else around the world. While there‚Äôs no telling if this rollout will be successful or not, establishing a global vaccine/health passport system is certainly the goal of these people. An entire tyranny is being built around these people allegedly being concerned about your health. This is insane because they obviously do not give a shit about your health. All the measures in response to the coronavirus like the lockdowns, masks etc.. have been detrimental to people‚Äôs health around the world. This passport system doesn‚Äôt help matters either but it is sure great for the billionaires who want to shape and control every aspect of the world."
Virus Hoaxing Fraud Fauci Says Masks Till 2022,1585,"The virus hoaxing fraud Anthony Fauci was on CNN the other day saying that masks will be here until 2022. Dr. Fauci says that it's ""possible"" that Americans will be wearing masks in 2022.

Remember when he told people not to wear masks and then later said that he purposefully lied about masks? Then he started talking about how great it was to wear goggles and multiple masks? The fact that anybody listens to anything he has to say at this point is the craziest thing imaginable. For some reason people have allowed this fool and his boss Bill Gates to be the ultimate authority on everything relating to public health and the environment. But if you think masks are going away by 2022, you are sorely mistaken. Even if we see restrictions lifted, there will be people wearing masks well past 2022 because they have been psychologically destroyed and traumatized by people like Fauci, fearmongering politicians and the Jewish media. They literally believe they could die or kill people around them if they aren‚Äôt wearing these retarded face diapers. This is all part of an agenda to implement a tyrannical world communist government by scaring people with fake viruses and fake environmental issues. It is meant to be permanent until they have achieved their goals."
Biden Working With Big Tech to Fight Vaccine Skeptics,2312,"The Jewish puppet and senile traitor to America Joe Biden is working with Silicon Valley to fight people who have questions about the coronavirus vaccine. Reuters: The White House has been reaching out to social media companies including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google about clamping down on COVID misinformation and getting their help to stop it from going viral, a senior administration official said. President Joe Biden, who has raced to curb the pandemic since taking office, has made inoculating Americans one of his top priorities and called the move ‚Äúa wartime effort.‚Äù But tackling public fear about taking the vaccine has emerged as a major impediment for the administration. Since the onset of the pandemic, calls from lawmakers asking the companies to tackle the spread of COVID misinformation on their platforms have grown. The White House‚Äôs direct engagement with the companies to mitigate the challenge has not been previously reported. Biden‚Äôs chief of staff Ron Klain has previously said the administration will try to work with Silicon Valley on the issue. ‚ÄúDisinformation that causes vaccine hesitancy is going to be a huge obstacle to getting everyone vaccinated and there are no larger players in that than the social media platforms,‚Äù said the source, who has direct knowledge of the White House‚Äôs efforts. Ron Klain is a Jew just in case you weren‚Äôt aware. He‚Äôs the Jewish usurper who is really running the White House. Here‚Äôs a picture of the kike. You can tell just by looking at him that he has the soul of a demon. Look, people have a right to be skeptical about these coronavirus vaccines. These are vaccines that were rushed out to market that do weird shit to your DNA. There are all sorts of reports about people dying after taking them. We even saw a nurse collapse on television after taking it. The coronavirus is no different than the flu. It has a survivability rate well over 99 percent. The vaccine is far more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. This is proven. But no, the Jews that run the Biden regime are demanding that any skepticism about these vaccines get deleted off the Internet. If these people are willing to go this far to make you take the vaccine, you should not take it. These people do not like you. In fact they hate you and want you dead."
Cola Cola Instructs Employees to be Less White,1356,"Cola Cola is actually spending money on training programs that require their employees to be less White.

After all, these are symbols of White supremacy because the polar bears and Santa Claus are both White. This is retarded beyond belief but nothing surprises me anymore. We all know what would happen if a company told their black employees to be less black. The Jewish media and their black slaves would do everything they could to destroy that company.

Israeli 2020 Death Numbers Prove Coronavirus a Hoax,2379,"The Jerusalem Post has published an article on Israeli death numbers for 2020. The numbers prove conclusively that the coronavirus has been a massive hoax. Jerusalem Post: Coronavirus has thus far claimed approximately 2.3 million lives across the world. In Israel last week the number of deaths from the disease passed the 5,000 mark, with most of the victims (87%) aged 65 and older. The appearance of the virus in Israel was accompanied by vigorous debate in the media and there were those who claimed that it was ‚Äúa hyped-up flu.‚Äù At the same time there were professionals at the Ministry of Health who maintained that it was a dangerous and lethal disease. An evaluation of the data for mortality in Israel nearly a year since the outbreak of the pandemic provides an answer, albeit a partial one, to this puzzle. The mortality data for 2020 indicate that 48.6 thousand people in Israel died during this year. The number of deaths in 2020 is high, as compared to the four preceding years. However, since the population of the country increased over the course of the year, the mortality rate (the number of deaths in relation to the size of the population) must also be taken into account. In 2020, the mortality rate was 5,300 people for every million residents, as compared to about 5,100 deaths on average for the years 2016-2019 (during which the rate ranged from 5,010 to 5,150). In other words, in 2020, the excess mortality (the number of deaths from all causes as compared to what one would expect to see under normal conditions) was about 1,700 people. Most of the excess mortality is found among older people. So basically, the Israeli deaths in 2020 were only a small amount higher than what would have been normally expected if you accounted for the population growth. Also noteworthy was the fact that the extra deaths were pretty much all old people. But for some reason we had to lock everything down destroy the economy and make healthy people wear hazmat suits to enter coffee shops over this. People should be asking some serious questions about the people who promoted this hoax and claimed that we were facing the plague of death. Because there was absolutely no justification for any of these measures many of which continue to this day when you look at these numbers. The virus hoaxers obviously had an agenda and that agenda was not about your health."
Facebook Bans Australians From Sharing News,2783,"The Jewish social media site Facebook has just banned Australians from sharing news links prompting all sorts of outrage. The Australian government is not happy about the situation. Daily Mail: Facebook has blocked Australians from accessing and sharing news in protest at a new law which would have forced the site to pay for the content it hosts. Furious Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the move shows tech companies ‚Äòthink they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them‚Äô while others branded it ‚Äòan assault on a sovereign nation‚Äô and an ‚Äòabuse of power‚Äô. The backlash quickly went international, with one Democrat politician in the US saying it shows ‚ÄòFacebook is not compatible with democracy‚Äò while the hashtag ‚ÄòDelete Facebook‚Äô quickly began trending on rival site Twitter. Australians searching Facebook for news today were instead shown notifications saying ‚Äòno posts‚Äô were available. Attempting to share news links brought up a message saying ‚Äòthis post can‚Äôt be shared‚Äô. But the shock move also stopped some government messages being shared, including from emergency services providing essential information on Covid, fires, and help for victims of domestic violence. Charities, foodbanks and at least one missing persons page were also caught up in the ban. Facebook, by far the world‚Äôs largest social network, rode to battle in Australia amid fears the idea of payment for content could catch on elsewhere ‚Äì with the UK and EU working on similar laws and policymakers in the US showing interest. Prime Minister Morrison said: ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äôs actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing.‚Äô ‚ÄòThese actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them. ‚ÄòThey may be changing the world, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they run it. ‚ÄòWe will not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament.‚Äô At this point, Australia should just ban this company from operating inside of their country. It‚Äôs insane that a foreign corporation has this much control over people‚Äôs communications to the point where they are preventing Australians from being able to share news links. It‚Äôs no different than if a foreign phone company had come into Australia, setup all sorts of infrastructure and then started disconnected people‚Äôs phone service for having conversations about current events. A country simply can‚Äôt maintain its sovereignty when such a situation exists. Countries need to get rid of these Jewish tech companies that are doing this and fund national alternatives."
War Criminal Tony Blair Demands COVID Vaccine Passports,3166,"The disgraced war criminal Tony Blair is demanding that a global system of COVID vaccine passports be setup. He is claiming that we can‚Äôt go back to normal until this is accomplished. Daily Mail: The former Labour Prime Minister threw his support behind ID cards for all UK citizens following the events of 9/11 but was later billed as an ‚Äúentitlement card‚Äù to fight against benefit fraud. The scheme began its rollout in 2009 but was embarrassingly scrapped just a year later by the new Tory/Lib Dem coalition Government. But now the former Prime Minister is calling for the introduction of a Covid passport so the world can return to ‚Äúat least some of the physical interaction we used to take for granted‚Äù. He told MailOnline: ‚ÄúMore than 120 countries, including our own, already demand that international travellers show proof of a full negative test result before entry. Once vaccinations become widespread, this demand will naturally move to vaccination. ‚ÄúCall it a passport, a certificate or proof of status ‚Äì we will want to know. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay in lockdown for ever. But we know from experience that as we come out of lockdown, the disease will start to spread again unless we keep some form of controls on who can come into our country and unless we take reasonable precautions to stamp on any outbreak should it recur. ‚ÄúThis is not about discrimination, or hostility towards those not vaccinated or tested. It is a completely understandable desire to know whether those we mix with might be carrying the disease. ‚ÄúHave they had an internationally recognised test (based on PCR swabs, which look for traces of Covid‚Äôs genetic material, or other equally valid tests as they are developed) to demonstrate that they are free form the virus? ‚ÄúHave they been vaccinated and, if so, is that with one or two jabs? ‚ÄúIt is increasingly obvious that other countries feel the same. There is already a host of initiatives starting around the world with this aim in mind.‚Äù The coronavirus is a mild flu virus that well over 99 percent of people easily survive. There is absolutely no reason for these insane measures. Blair is telling people that they have to be vaccinated and carry a special passport in order to be able to travel and return to some level of normalcy. This idea that it is not about discriminating against people who refuse vaccinations is utter bullshit. He‚Äôs saying that people who get vaccinated and are given this vaccine passport will be allowed to operate like they did before, whereas people who don‚Äôt get vaccinated will not be allowed this privilege. What he is describing is blatant discrimination. It‚Äôs not exactly known why people like Blair and others have such an interest in vaccinating as many people as possible with this weird experimental and untested vaccine, but based on Blair‚Äôs track record, we can assume that he does not have our best interests in mind. I mean, do you think he gave a damn about the health of all the Iraqis he slaughtered in the Iraq war based on false claims of WMDs? I think not, so it would be foolish to think that he cares about your health. This is a very sick and evil person we are dealing with here."
98 Percent Decrease in US Flu Cases,1104,"There has reportedly been a 98 percent decrease in flu cases from last year. Business Insider: Public-health experts prepared for a ‚Äútwindemic‚Äù as fall approached last year: a double threat of the coronavirus and the seasonal flu. But even as cold, dry weather descended on the Northern Hemisphere and COVID-19 cases surged, the US and UK have experienced historically mild flu seasons. Between October 1 and January 30, just 155 Americans were hospitalized with the flu, compared to 8,633 during roughly the same time frame a year ago. That‚Äôs a 98% decrease. Labs in the US have collected and tested more than half a million samples for the flu since late September, but just 0.2% of those samples tested positive (1,300 in total), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every US state is experiencing ‚Äúminimal‚Äù flu activity, the agency reported. That‚Äôs in contrast from last season, when 22,000 Americans died of the flu. Maybe that‚Äôs because flu cases are being diagnosed as COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 is really just another variation of the flu. Just a guess on my part though."
COVID Cases Down 45 Percent Allegedly,1739,"Coronavirus cases are allegedly down 45 percent since January 11th. Daily Mail: As the deadliest month of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. came to end, the nation is seeing signs of progress including plummeting rates of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations and accelerating vaccinations rates. Daily cases have dropped 45 percent since the latest peak on January 11, according to data from the COVID-19 Tracking Project. There were 131,341 new cases reported on Wednesday. Hospitalizations have fallen 26 percent since they peaked most recently on January 12, the data shows, with 96,534 reported in the hospital as of Wednesday. Forty-four states are seeing a decline in cases, Johns Hopkins data reveals, with just Alabama, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, on the upswing. This data is coming from Johns Hopkins which has been a key organization supporting this hoax. Interesting how they are saying that these cases are down just as the illegitimate vegetable Joe Biden usurped the presidency. The establishment appears to have made a strategic decision to scale back this hoax a bit and combine it with the climate change hoax. Now that their puppet is in the White House, they want to try and give him some legitimacy by claiming that his dumb policies curbed the scamdemic. This ties in with how propaganda operations like CNN are no longer plastering all the hoax virus numbers 24/7 any longer. Whatever the case, none of these numbers ever made sense. The tests themselves generated all sorts of false positives. The whole thing has been the most insane hoax imaginable and the amount of damage it has caused is incalculable. There is no going back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù from this."
Baseball Legend Dies After Taking COVID Vaccine,925,"Hall of Fame baseball player Hank Aaron took the coronavirus vaccine a short while ago. He did it to show his fellow black people that the coronavirus vaccine was safe and to encourage others to take it. This idea did not go as planned because Hank Aaron is now dead. Now granted, Aaron was in his 80s and he might have died of something unrelated. But it certainly isn‚Äôt good public relations to see someone like Aaron drop dead a few weeks after taking the vaccine. It raises even more questions about the safety of this terribly rushed vaccine. There are numerous reports around the world of people dying or have all sorts of health issues after taking the vaccine. You‚Äôd be a fool to take it. Taking the vaccine is basically allowing yourself to be a human guinea pig. Plus, it is clear based on what we are seeing that the vaccine is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. Long story short, do not take the vaccine!"
COVID Hoax Media Narrative Suddenly Changes,2135,"Now that the terrible orange man has been removed from office via a fraudulent election, it looks as if the Jewish media has decided to change the narrative on the coronavirus hoax. Since they no longer have the bad orange man to blame on anything, they‚Äôve decided to stop focusing on it. CNN in particular has stopped displaying all of the fake coronavirus statistics. The World Health Organization has started talking about the false positive issues with the coronavirus tests. We basically have people admitting many of the things that we were saying about this dumb hoax this entire time. Things they called conspiracy theories this past year are now being reported on as facts. They probably figure that they are in a fairly precarious position with half the country not recognizing the legitimacy of the Harris-Biden regime. The economy has been left in shambles thanks to policies advanced by the media and many uniparty politicians. And people are generally very angry right now. So they‚Äôre trying to carefully manage the situation. Democrat politicians are also coming out and saying that we need to open the economy up again. Go figure that they would say these things after the Harris-Biden regime was illegally installed. Whatever the thought process is, they seem to be shifting away from this virus bullshit and pushing this angle claiming that anybody who disagrees with them are terrorists and should be put in camps and/or killed. Because of that, I‚Äôm not sure we can really consider this a positive development. But the shift away from the coronavirus hoax is noteworthy. They‚Äôll probably use the false positive test stuff to claim cases are going down and then try to give credit to the Harris-Biden regime for fixing the non-existent problem. We can also assume that they will still use this fake virus threat to ensure people‚Äôs freedoms are limited, but it just won‚Äôt be as big of a focus. It‚Äôs all so stupid. These people used a hoax to destroy and ruin the lives of millions for no reason outside of political power and profits. They all deserve to spend eternity in hell for their role in pushing this gay hoax."
UK: Dumb Gook Doctor Says Brits Could Wear Masks Forever,1460,"Some dumb gook who holds a position in the British government‚Äôs healthcare system is saying that Brits could wear masks forever because of the flu.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the pandemic has changed how Brits approach hygiene and that some habits that we have adopted still stay with us. The top medic add that lockdown will probably be with us until ‚Äúmid to late Spring‚Äù. The professor also cautioned that the virus will be with us ‚Äúfor the foreseeable future‚Äù. Prof Van-Tam said during an exclusive interview with The Sun: ‚ÄúThe pandemic has changed a lot of things. It has changed the way you and I approach hand hygiene. ‚ÄúWe all carry hand sanitiser around now, we all expect in most of the places we go into that hand sanitiser is provided at the door. ‚ÄúI think there are going to be people who make a personal decision to say, you know what, when I‚Äôm in a crowded place in the winter I‚Äôm going to put a face covering on. When I‚Äôm on a tube I am going to put a face covering on.‚Äù Hey Dr. Gook, you are a stupid gook for even suggesting this.

Jack Dorsey Claims Trump Was Banned to Limit Violence,4197,"Jack Dorsey the deranged weirdo who allegedly runs Twitter, put out a series of posts explaining why banning the President of the United States was 100 percent necessary. He basically claimed that banning Trump along with tens of thousands of other pro-Trump accounts was needed to limit violence. The last straw being the fun party at the Capitol Building that resulted in a stolen podium. AP: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defended his company‚Äôs ban of President Donald Trump in a philosophical Twitter thread that is his first public statement on the subject. When Trump incited his followers to storm the U.S. Capitol last week, then continued to tweet potentially ominous messages, Dorsey said the resulting risk to public safety created an ‚Äúextraordinary and untenable circumstance‚Äù for the company. Having already briefly suspended Trump‚Äôs account the day of the Capitol riot, Twitter on Friday banned Trump entirely, then smacked down the president‚Äôs attempts to tweet using other accounts. ‚ÄúI do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter,‚Äú Dorsey wrote. But he added: ‚ÄùI believe this was the right decision for Twitter.‚Äù Dorsey acknowledged that shows of strength like the Trump ban could set dangerous precedents, even calling them a sign of ‚Äúfailure.‚Äù Although not in so many words, Dorsey suggested that Twitter needs to find ways to avoid having to make such decisions in the first place. Exactly how that would work isn‚Äôt clear, although it could range from earlier and more effective moderation to a fundamental restructuring of social networks. In Dorsey-speak, that means Twitter needs to work harder to ‚Äúpromote healthy conversation.‚Äù Extreme measures such as banning Trump also highlight the extraordinary power that Twitter and other Big Tech companies can wield without accountability or recourse, Dorsey wrote. While Twitter was grappling with the problem of Trump, for instance, Apple, Google and Amazon were effectively shutting down the right-wing site Parler by denying it access to app stores and cloud-hosting services. The companies charged that Parler wasn‚Äôt aggressive enough about removing calls to violence, which Parler has denied. Dorsey declined to criticize his Big Tech counterparts directly, even noting that ‚Äúthis moment in time might call for this dynamic.‚Äù Over the long term, however, he suggested that aggressive and domineering behavior could threaten the ‚Äúnoble purpose and ideals‚Äù of the open internet by entrenching the power of a few organizations over a commons that should be accessible to everyone. He further added that if people did not like what he did, that people were welcome to use another service. This after Dorsey put out a tweet gloating about Parler, one of their main competitors, being forced offline after large Silicon Valley firms colluded against them. So it isn‚Äôt like people really can go to an alternative service with Parler being offline and Gab being barely usable at the moment. Simply put, this fool is living on another planet. Limiting people‚Äôs ability to speak and express their grievances only increases the possibility of violence. You can‚Äôt tell half if not more of the country that their views are not welcome in the digital public square and not expect some major problems. Especially with the economic and societal situation we have that has been the result of all these lunatic virus lockdowns. People are on the brink of going crazy and limiting their speech will only drive more people over the edge. Over the past several years, assholes like Dorsey have banned people from the digital public square simply for having opinions that they dislike. Questioning the election fraud and the coronavirus hoax has been enough to get people banned from all the different big social media sites. I remember when these sites first started arbitrarily banning people for their opinions. I knew when they started doing this that they were dooming themselves into an unwinnable position. You can‚Äôt claim that you run a free and open platform while simultaneously acting as the thought police. The good news is that the backlash is here and it isn‚Äôt going to be good for people like Dorsey."

The LAPD didn‚Äôt give a shit and just let the protesters do there thing. The problem is that there are so many brainwashed people out there who think this is all real and literally believe that someone not wearing a mask is a threat to their health and safety. They actually believe the virus propaganda and will lash out angrily at people who refuse to go along with it. I‚Äôve personally been kicked out of a gym I went to for many years for refusing to go along with this mask bullshit and have gotten into numerous confrontations with people over this issue. And you can see this phenomenon on full display with what happened at this protest. At this point, I just assume that anybody I don‚Äôt know is insane until they offer me proof that they are not insane."
Australia: Fines Being Issued to People for Not Wearing a Mask,1695,"In Australia, they are now issuing fines to people who refuse to wear a mask in public.

If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask. When used alone, masks can give you a false feeling of protection and can even be a source of infection when not used correctly. ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/0nyHux1SgN pic.twitter.com/JDQhnowx3p ‚Äî World Health Organization Western Pacific (@WHOWPRO) March 26, 2020 You may also recall that many of the top virus hoaxers were also telling people not to wear a mask around this time. When this first started I found it bizarre that they would be telling people to not wear masks when we didn‚Äôt know what it was. I had no problem with someone who felt safer wearing a mask to wear one since we didn‚Äôt know specifically what was going on. But now that we know what we are dealing with, we know for a fact that cloth masks don‚Äôt do a damn thing to stop the spread of this alleged doomsday virus, so it is absurd that they are making them compulsory. Especially when wearing a mask for certain individuals can be very bad for their health because of preexisting conditions. This whole agenda is about destroying people‚Äôs freedoms and has nothing to do with public health. In fact, everything they have done has been bad for people‚Äôs health."

"Major Crowds Celebrate New Year in Wuhan, China",1761,"Crowds of people came out into the streets to celebrate the new year in Wuhan, China. As many of you recall, this was the place where the coronavirus was said to have originated from. Meanwhile in major cities throughout the West, there were no crowds celebrating the new year due to draconian restrictions put in place by governments in the name of fighting the virus. This tweet contrasting the scenes in Wuhan vs New York City tells the whole story.

This was lifted several months ago. They never mandated a closure of their economy and effectively declared the crisis as being over in the early part of 2020. The fact that they‚Äôve kept everything open and they have had no public health crisis proves conclusively that this entire thing has been a massive hoax. In the West, we have seen a totally hysterical response that continues to this day. It has been proven through data that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu and it primarily impacts old people and people with preexisting conditions. We also know that the overall death numbers did not radically change from previous years to 2020. It is a plandemic/scamdemic further bolstered by the fact that people have been filming all sorts of empty hospitals in the middle of this alleged health crisis. The fact that all restrictions have not been lifted by Western governments, proves that this is part of a malicious agenda to hurt the people. China has at least chosen not to destroy their country over this and they are greatly benefitting from this decision."

As it is effectively transferring the wealth of the middle class into his bank account. His wife Melinda Gates previously claimed that they hadn‚Äôt considered the economic consequences of the lockdowns. But she apparently wants us to believe that it is just a coincidence that her husband‚Äôs fortune has continually increased over the past nine months as a result of this hoax. We know that this virus is no more dangerous than the flu. These lockdowns have been totally unnecessary and have nothing to do with public health. If anything they have only damaged public health considering that depression and suicides have gone through the roof. These lockdowns have been put into place to hurt people and transfer wealth to the billionaire class.

Comically, Angela Merkel is claiming that this i only ‚Äútemporary.‚Äù But we all know these lockdowns are anything but temporary. If they lift anything, it is only because they plan to reinstitute the lockdowns at a later date. They have no intention of ending any of this insanity. They are purposefully creating uncertainty so that it is impossible for people to function and operate with any foundation or stability. There isn‚Äôt even any data or scientific rationale proving that these measures prevent the spread of the coronavirus. We‚Äôve had all sorts of bizarre restrictions put into place everywhere around the world and none of them have stopped the spread. It is simply not possible to stop it.

It has been the response to the coronavirus that will be pushing all these people into extreme poverty. Of course, the UN is not going to say that because they are part of the very same system that is imposing these stupid restrictions on people. If they really cared about people‚Äôs health they‚Äôd be demanding an end to the lockdowns. From a health perspective, catching a virus that is no more dangerous than the flu is far less of a problem than people plunging into extreme poverty and starving to death.

Many simple joys in life are gone thanks to this insanity. It is interesting to see that at the same time we have this skyrocketing depression among our young people, there has been a major push to legalize marijuana and drugs. It‚Äôd be one thing to legalize drugs if we had a normal functioning society, but what we have now is a dysfunctional mess that one would have previously only envisioned seeing in a science fiction movie. So the only reason this was done was for malicious reasons. They want our young people to turn to drugs and die. There isn‚Äôt even any serious attempt to reverse any of this.

Millions of people are dealing with all sorts of problems because of the coronavirus hoax, lockdowns and economic difficulties. A large percentage of these people will turn to drugs and alcohol. If marijuana and drugs are legal, it will be far easier for people to obtain these substances and thus easier for them to destroy themselves. But that all appears to be part of the plan.

Thailand Bans Access to Porn Websites,2089,"Thailand has just announced a major ban targeting prominent pornographic websites.

Claiming that such a ban is a free speech issue represents a Jewish position. Throughout history, pornography has been considered an obscenity that has nothing to do with free speech or articulating political ideas. Besides, prostitution is already widespread in Thailand. It is certainly more healthy for men to acquire the services of a prostitute than it is for them to be sitting in a room jerking off to pornography in front of a computer. And my assumption is that people could still access these sites via VPN or other methods any way. Either way, it looks like the shill revolutionary groups are going to try and seize on this in order to further their goals of overthrowing the government. It‚Äôs actually somewhat insane that they are going to use the issue of pornography to aid their efforts, but that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing."

The bottom line is that this country is not going to be safe if you have this amount of people forced out into the streets. Desperate people will do desperate things. Prepare yourself accordingly."
WTF Happened to Mitch McConnell?,998,"Did Mitch McConnell get beat up or something? He looks like shit. His hands are all bruised and are purple. Seriously, this is not normal. I‚Äôm wondering if he got threatened and beaten over the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Barrett. Because these bruises are a recent phenomenon. They didn‚Äôt just appear out of the ether and he certainly didn‚Äôt have these bruises a few weeks ago. And sure, maybe he has some health problems he‚Äôs not telling people about, but there is a higher than zero chance that somebody beat him up for some sort of political reason. He has also said that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him which is hard to believe considering his physical appearance.

500 Zillion Americans Will Die Unless Everyone Wears Masks,1690,"Guess what everyone? Zillions of Americans are going to die unless all Americans wear masks. Models say so and models are never wrong. Reuters: The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 could surpass 500,000 by February unless nearly all Americans wear face masks, researchers said on Friday, as 14 states set new records for one-day increases in infections. The latest estimate by the widely cited University of Washington‚Äôs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation reflects fears that cold winter weather will drive Americans indoors, where the virus is more likely to spread. Nationwide, 76,195 new cases were reported on Thursday, according to a Reuters analysis, just shy of the single-day record high of 77,299 reported on July 16. Only India has reported more cases in a single day: 97,894, on Sept. 17. ‚ÄúWe are heading into a very substantial fall/winter surge,‚Äù said IHME director Chris Murray, who co-led the research. This is from the IHME a highly credible organization lol. When you see the phrase ‚Äúmodeling scenarios‚Äù or ‚Äúmodeling predicts‚Äù just stop reading and put down the phone, okay?

Trump Releases Interview With Rude 60 Minutes Jew Lesley Stahl,3000,"The Jewish media was claiming that Donald Trump was a bad orange man because he refused to finish an interview with the lying Jewish hag Lesley Stahl from 60 Minutes. As a result, he decided to release video of the full interview prior to it airing on 60 Minutes. Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS. Tonight‚Äôs anchor, Kristen Welker, is far worse! #MAGA https://t.co/ETDJzMQg8X ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2020 I just finished watching it. It shows the Jew Stahl being aggressively rude with Trump throughout the interview. Trump was perfectly justified in ending it early. The characterization of the interview by the Jewish New York Times is a total lie. Stahl was not calmly asking him questions. President Trump posted a clip of his interview with Lesley Stahl that showed her calmly asking him questions on the coronavirus and other topics ‚Äî but he urged followers to ‚Äúlook at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS.‚Äù https://t.co/SMcIYMyQ1Q ‚Äî The New York Times (@nytimes) October 22, 2020 Stahl repeatedly lied throughout the interview during her aggressive questioning. Stahl claimed that the Russia hoax coup was not a hoax even though it has been fully proven to be a hoax. She also denied that there is any scandal surrounding Joe Biden and his son‚Äôs laptop. Bill O‚ÄôReilly even noted how absurd this was. Lesley Stahl denies the economy before the pandemic was ‚Äúrecord breaking,‚Äù accuses Mr. Trump of endangering people at his rallies and, incredibly, denies there is any ‚Äúscandal‚Äù surrounding Joe Biden.

Over One Million New Yorkers Can‚Äôt Afford Food,757,"Was shutting down the economy because of the flu worth it? You tell me when you read this news blurb. FOX 5: The lines are long and the need is enormous. More than 1 million New Yorkers can‚Äôt afford food, and standing on long lines at food banks is now too common amid the pandemic. ‚ÄúWe have done disasters before but nothing is even close to what we are doing now,‚Äù Alexander Rapaport, the executive director of Masbia soup kitchen network, told FOX 5 NY. Maybe Bill de Blasio can explain to me how people not having food to eat is good for their health. I‚Äôd really like to hear his thoughts on this subject.

‚ÄúWearing a Mask is About Showing Others You Care for Them‚Äù,1362,"There is no data or evidence suggesting that wearing a paper cloth over your face also known as a cuck muzzle will do anything to stop the spread of the coronavirus. It‚Äôs also been proven that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu. So now we have Democrat politicians like the faggot governor of Washington Jay Inslee telling people that wearing a mask shows you care about them. Wearing a mask is about showing others you care for them. ‚Äî Jay Inslee (@JayInslee) October 20, 2020 This is gay as all fuck. This the same asshole who ran a failed presidential campaign centered around stopping climate change while lecturing us about how we have to listen to science. Well, the scientific data around wearing masks shows pretty conclusively that it doesn‚Äôt do shit to stop the spread of viruses. So this cocksucking piece of shit like the rest of these communist retards selectively follows the science when it suits him. The fact that they are shifting to emotional pleas instead of hard data to justify these mask edicts shows that they are running out of excuses to justify this insanity. The public is also tiring of this kabuki theater nonsense. The mask-wearing is nothing more than pathetic virtue signaling than it is about doing anything substantive to protect public health. Inslee is admitting it when he puts out faggy statements like this."
Trump Agrees That Michigan‚Äôs Cunt Governor Should Be Locked Up,1580,"At Donald Trump‚Äôs recent rally in Michigan, the crowd demanded that the state‚Äôs cunt governor be locked up.

CDC Study Proves Masks Fail to Stop Coronavirus Spread,1956,"When this virus hysteria first began, I thought it was strange that the power structure was telling people not to wear masks. Since we didn‚Äôt know what we were dealing with, I thought that people should be encouraged to wear masks on a voluntary basis. It would have helped ease people‚Äôs fears about what was going on and reduce the possibility of widespread panic and civil disorder. Fast forward several months later and we have hard data showing that masks do not stop the spread of the coronavirus. They are pretty much useless at stopping the spread. But despite this knowledge, we have the power structure not just encouraging people to wear masks but in many cases forcing them to wear masks against their will. A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 85 percent of coronavirus patients wore masks always or often. What this means is that despite their habitual mask usage, they still caught the coronavirus. If a mask was truly effective at stopping the spread of the coronavirus, there is no reason why this high percentage of people would come down with it. You have fact-checkers and other morons on Twitter trying to split hairs with the findings, but the findings indicate that all this mask nonsense is just kabuki theater gibberish. Tucker Carlson even reported on it and his reporting was blocked on Facebook. Tucker Carlson was censored about CDC mask finding and so was I. My family and I escaped socialistic Czechoslovakia where they did this. pic.twitter.com/kOOiyvmFe7 ‚Äî American (@zuzana_czech) October 15, 2020 So why are people being forced to wear masks and why are social media companies banning government data that shows mask usage to be ineffective at stopping the spread of the coronavirus? It obviously isn‚Äôt about protecting people‚Äôs health. It‚Äôs part of a social engineering program designed to turn society into a hellish and bizarre dystopia. There is no other explanation outside of that."

The movie theater industry is dead. What they are doing is equivalent of performing CPR on a corpse that‚Äôs been buried in the ground for months. They should sue the government and the Jews in the media who promoted all of this fake virus hysteria. But I don‚Äôt feel too bad for them since they are promoting the hysteria by requiring people to wear masks in their theaters. All because they allegedly claim to care about everyone‚Äôs health. The thing is, that‚Äôs turning away a large number of people who may have wanted to spend a night out at the theater who don‚Äôt believe that the coronavirus is the death plague. These people are not going to want to deal with the mask bullshit. There‚Äôs also no new content that is theater exclusive. The little horrible new content that‚Äôs being released is just going straight to streaming services. I would expect the entire movie theater industry to be totally finished by the early part of 2021 if not sooner."
Jewish YouTube to Ban Coronavirus Vaccine Dissent,1343,"The Jewish-run website known as YouTube or as I like to call it, JewTube, has announced that they are going to ban anybody who questions the safety of coronavirus vaccines. The Hill: YouTube will ban content containing misinformation about coronavirus vaccines, expanding its policy surrounding misinformation about the virus, the company said Wednesday. The Google-owned video platform said it will remove any content that includes claims about COVID-19 vaccinations that contradicts information from health authorities. YouTube was already removing content with misinformation about the existence and the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as content promoting medically unsubstantiated methods of treatment. The platform said it had removed more than 200,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 information since early February. These kikes literally want to control all of your thoughts. One of the things they want you to believe is that all of these coronavirus vaccines are very safe and that if you don‚Äôt take it you will die. Any opinion outside of that will get you banned off the site. For whatever reason, the entire Jewish system wants everybody to take a coronavirus vaccine. The very fact that they want you to take it, is reason enough not to take it. There‚Äôs no telling what these vaccines will do to you."

Sweden imposed no lockdowns or restrictions of any kind allowing herd immunity to naturally develop and no apocalypse unfolded. The lockdowns are what‚Äôs unethical but this nigger retard is claiming that all of the draconian restrictions is what is ethical. Everything is backwards.

What Happens if Chris Christie Survives the Coronavirus?,2015,"As many of you know, Chris Christie is a very fat individual in his late 50s.

But despite being in a high risk category, Christie still has an excellent chance of surviving it. And assuming he survives, it will further prove that this narrative about the coronavirus being the plague of death is a bunch of bullshit. There have been countless stories of people over the age of 100 surviving this. Here are a few examples.

White House Staffers and GOP Leaders Test Positive for Coronavirus,3424,"The Jewish media is going nuts about how all sorts of White House staffers and Republican politicians have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Almost all of the high profile people who allegedly died from the coronavirus had pre-existing conditions. People like Roy Horn and Herman Cain. The fact of the matter is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how many lunatic restrictions you put in place. It is impossible to stop its spread. Trump and other high level people at the White House were inevitably going to get it at some point. The proper policy is to lift all of these mask requirements, social distancing protocols and other lockdown orders. This will allow healthy people to develop herd immunity. Higher risk individuals like older people and those with pre-existing conditions can be encouraged to isolate themselves, wear masks or whatever they feel comfortable doing. All we have to do is look at what happened in Sweden and Belarus. Neither of these countries imposed weird restrictions and allowed the virus to run its course. Sweden is currently better off than many other countries that imposed draconian lockdowns. That‚Äôs because they let their people naturally develop herd immunity. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the number of people hospitalized for/with the coronavirus in the United States is minimal. Many states have very low coronavirus-related hospitalizations which is why the fools in the media primarily talk about cases in their non-stop virus doom propaganda. This is arguably the biggest hoax ever perpetuated on the world. It is time to recognize that this is all a bunch of bullshit and focus in on rebuilding the economy which has been left devastated because of this insane hoax."

Even though he is an older man and a bit overweight, he has no pre-existing conditions and is in otherwise good health. The fact that he tested positive for this is actually a good thing. Because whenever he‚Äôs done spending his time in quarantine, he‚Äôll be able to tell people first hand that it isn‚Äôt that bad and it is time to end the lockdowns and restrictions. He can use himself as an example proving that it is literally no different than the flu. Assuming that he wins the election on November 3rd, I expect him to push for removing all this lockdown insanity immediately."
Elon Musk Attacks Virus Hoaxer Bill Gates and Lockdown Lunacy,3214,"Elon Musk continues to be on point about the coronavirus hoax. On a podcast, he recently attacked top virus hoaxer Bill Gates, said that he had no need to take a coronavirus vaccine and called the virus related lockdowns unethical. RT: SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk has said that neither he nor his family will likely take future coronavirus vaccines even when they are readily available, saying the pandemic has ‚Äúdiminished [his] faith in humanity.‚Äù Speaking during a podcast interview with Kara Swisher, 49-year-old Musk stated that neither he nor his children are at risk for Covid-19 and therefore would be unlikely to need the vaccine. ‚ÄúThis is a no-win situation. It has diminished my faith in humanity, this whole thing‚Ä¶ The irrationality of people in general,‚Äù Musk said. He also decried lockdowns across the globe and in the US in particular, having previously referred to them as ‚Äúunethical‚Äù and ‚Äúde facto house arrest.‚Äù Musk said widespread lockdowns were a mistake and only at-risk people should quarantine ‚Äúuntil the storm passes.‚Äù When pressed about the risk to his own employees and their families, with Swisher asking what if someone dies, Musk pithily responded: ‚ÄúEverybody dies.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been making cars this entire time and it‚Äôs been great,‚Äù he said of Tesla keeping its factory doors open in defiance of lockdown rules, which at one point prompted an irate response from Musk and even a lawsuit against Alameda County. He added that SpaceX has been fully operational throughout the pandemic thanks to its national security clearance. ‚ÄúThrough this entire thing, we didn‚Äôt skip a day. We had national security clearance because we were doing national security work. We sent astronauts to the space station and back.‚Äù Musk also took aim at Bill Gates, highlighting that his fellow billionaire‚Äôs criticisms of lockdown skeptics are unfounded and misplaced in Musk‚Äôs case. ‚ÄúGates said something about me not knowing what I was doing. It‚Äôs like, hey, knucklehead, we actually make the vaccine machines for CureVac, that company you‚Äôre invested in,‚Äù Musk explained, referring to the fact that Tesla manufacturers machines for CureVac. The entrepreneur also noted that he works closely with the Harvard epidemiology team which is currently working on Covid-19 antibody studies. I fully agree with Musk on all points, including his point about how he has lost faith in humanity. I personally lost faith in humanity many years ago and this virus hoax coupled with the insane response to it has further eroded my faith in humanity. Anybody who objectively looks at the data surrounding the coronavirus will come to the conclusion that it is no more deadly than the flu. Since it primarily impacts old people and people with pre-existing conditions, the idea of shutting down the economy, locking everything down and making healthy people wear masks is nuts. But a large portion of the world‚Äôs population has accepted these measures due to their own stupidity, lack of curiosity and non-stop propaganda being pumped into their brains. I hope Musk continues to articulate how stupid this virus hoax and the lockdowns are. He is in a great position to expose the truth to a very large number of people."
New York City Deploys Mask Patrols,1511,"The news out of New York City keeps getting crazier. They‚Äôre now deploying patrols to ensure people are wearing masks out in public. Fox 5 NY: In announcing a testing blitz to take place in emerging coronavirus hotspots in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio also warned that there is going to be an enforcement blitz. Nine ZIP codes in the city are seeing a spike in new COVID-19 cases. The mayor announced during a Tuesday morning briefing that there will be a lot more community outreach in those areas including hundreds of so-called Trace Corps members and hundreds of additional city agency workers in the neighborhoods. Patrols will start issuing fines to people who refuse to wear masks even after being offered a free mask and a warning that not wearing it will result in a fine. ‚ÄúThat will happen aggressively. Clearly, our goal, of course, is to give everyone a free face mask and get them to wear it,‚Äù de Blasio said. The mayor also announced that the city‚Äôs health department has ordered non-public schools and child care centers to close if they do not follow the commission‚Äôs order on health safeguards. As these mask patrols are being deployed, New York City is dealing with all sorts of violent crime that is being intentionally ignored. The city‚Äôs government is more concerned about harassing ordinary people than they are solving real problems. I have no idea why any single person would want to continue living in New York City. It is one of the worst places in the world to be in right now."
UK Going Into Second Lockdown Over Virus Hoax,1851,"The United Kingdom is going into a second lockdown because they are afraid of people catching the flu. Reuters: The British government is planning to enforce a total social lockdown across a majority of northern Britain and potentially London, to combat a second wave of COVID-19, The Times reported late on Sunday. Under the new lockdown measures being considered, all pubs, restaurants and bars would be ordered to shut for two weeks initially, the report said. Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said any new national lockdown would threaten jobs, livelihoods and human contact. The report added that households would also be banned indefinitely from meeting each other in any indoor location where they were not already under the order. Britain had last week imposed new measures that required people to work from home where possible and had ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19, with new restrictions lasting probably six months. So these new lunatic restrictions could last six months they say. I wouldn‚Äôt bet on that. They first said that the first round of restrictions would only last a few weeks to ensure hospitals didn‚Äôt get overrun. When that didn‚Äôt happen, they invented new reasons why the lockdowns had to continue. Does anybody think this round of lockdowns will be different? When six months are up they‚Äôll find new reasons to continue them. This is about creating an entirely new society based around the fear of viruses and germs. Maybe this will end after every single small business in the world has been destroyed and everybody has been implanted with tracking chips. Or maybe it will end after the Jews successfully establish a global government controlled from Israel. Whatever happens, I am not optimistic that this madness will end anytime soon."
UK Study Shows Lockdown Killing More Than the Virus,3621,"Anybody with a brain and common sense could see that all these lunatic lockdowns were going to kill many more people than the coronavirus. I was saying that this was going to be the case back around March/April 2020. Now we have a study out of the UK saying the exact same thing I was predicting months ago. RT: Thousands of Britons who suffer heart attacks and strokes are dying at home instead of seeking medical treatment, a new study has found, as new government figures show 75,000 are projected to die as a result of lockdown measures. Stay-at-home orders prompted countless people suffering from serious medical conditions to avoid hospitals, according to the study‚Äôs findings, which were published in the Heart medical journal and first reported by the Daily Mail. The paper noted that deaths from heart disease in private homes surged by 35 percent from March to July, resulting in 2,279 more fatalities on average over the past six years. However, heart and stroke deaths in hospitals dropped by around 1,400 during the same period, suggesting that some who chose to stay home would have died anyway even if they had been hospitalized. The researchers calculated that in total, there were 2,085 excess deaths in England and Wales that could be linked to heart attack and stroke sufferers who refused to seek out medical treatment. This means that between March 2 and June 30, every day 17 people died needlessly from heart attacks. The findings support government figures which underline the disastrous side-effects of the UK‚Äôs anti-coronavirus policies. A recently released report by the government‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) found that nearly 75,000 people could die over the next five years from non-Covid causes as a result of the lockdown. More than 30,000 of these projected deaths will be the result of undetected cancers, cancelled operations and health problems associated with economic recession. 26,000 are expected to die if people continue to avoid seeking out critical medical care. The grim predictions appear to already be playing out. According to data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there were 830 excess deaths at home in one week at the start of September compared to the five-year average of deaths. The UK has registered 5,556 excess deaths at home in the past eight weeks, but only 1,117 deaths were attributed to Covid-19 in the same period, the Telegraph reported. A study published in May by the British Medical Journal found that only one-third of excess deaths seen in England and Wales can be linked to coronavirus. This is exactly correct. Because of the coronavirus hysteria and subsequent lockdowns, people who needed other medical treatments couldn‚Äôt get those treatments. Some of those people are now dead because of this insane hoax. And we aren‚Äôt even talking about the millions upon millions of lives that have been ruined as a result of the lockdowns. The full toll of this has yet to be realized but suffice to say, there will be many suicides and deaths related to the economic disaster that these lockdowns have caused. The craziest thing is that we have places like Belarus and Sweden which did not do mass lockdowns on their people. In both those countries, the hospital system did not collapse and mass death did not occur. It proves that all of these lockdowns are totally unnecessary and should be lifted. The only reason why they are not lifting the lockdowns and in many cases imposing new lockdowns, is that they are being implemented intentionally for malicious purposes that have nothing to do with public health."
New Virus Propaganda Scaring People With Future ‚ÄúTwindemic‚Äù,1986,"The Jewish corporate media and a number of worthless douches on Twitter are telling people to be afraid of a coming ‚Äútwindemic‚Äù because of the seasonal flu. So not only do you have to be afraid of the coronavirus which is literally no more dangerous than the flu, but you also need to be afraid of the regular flu. As Covid-19 infections trend upward again in the US, public health experts warn that a ‚Äútwindemic‚Äù could be on the horizon as we head into flu season. https://t.co/kWYJtjFHUe pic.twitter.com/XsJs9K0fFr ‚Äî Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 21, 2020 Wearing masks, washing our hands, and watching our distance may well help stop the flu this year, as happened in the Southern Hemisphere.

They‚Äôre going to be pushing this for years. They don‚Äôt care about the data which shows that both the coronavirus and the normal flu have a minimal death rate. Well over 99 percent of people survive both of these ailments. This is all about scaring people into promoting bizarre dystopic agendas that have nothing to do with your personal health. Maybe they‚Äôll stop pushing this insanity after everybody has been confined to safety pods and the only company anybody can work for is Amazon."
CDC Posts New Coronavirus Guidance ‚ÄúIn Error‚Äù,2476,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to show what a worthless organization they are. They just admitted that new coronavirus guidance was posted on their website ‚Äúin error.‚Äù Reuters: The World Health Organization has not changed its policy on aerosol transmission of the coronavirus, it said on Monday after U.S. health officials published draft new guidance by mistake warning that it can spread through airborne particles. Mike Ryan, executive director of the UN agency‚Äôs emergencies programme, said he would follow up with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the next 24 hours after it said COVID-19 could spread through airborne particles that can remain suspended in the air and travel beyond six feet. ‚ÄúCertainly we haven‚Äôt seen any new evidence and our position on this remains the same,‚Äù he said in a briefing. The CDC said a draft version of changes to its recommendations were posted in error on its website while it was in the process of updating its guidance. It would repost the guidance once it had completed the review. The CDC has previously said the virus mainly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. The WHO‚Äôs Ryan said the agency still believes the disease is primarily spread through droplets, but that in crowded closed spaces with inadequate ventilation, aerosol transmission can occur. I honestly do not give a shit what anybody at the CDC or the WHO has to say about the coronavirus. They‚Äôve been wrong about the coronavirus every step of the way. But it is crazy that in the midst of this lunatic hysteria they helped create, they are causing further confusion by posting erroneous guidance. Robert Redfield the head of the CDC was also telling people not to wear masks earlier this year but is now recommending people wear masks. This despite the fact that masks have proven not to be effective and that what we are dealing with is no more dangerous than the flu. The data is clear and not in dispute. These organizations should be stating what I am stating with clarity and telling people not to panic. But they are not, which shows that they are intentionally promoting the needless hysteria. The CDC and the WHO should both be abolished. They are obviously not acting in the interest of public health. We need to be looking at them as biased political organizations which have been hugely responsible for giving credibility to this dumb hoax."
CDC Head Says Masks Better Than Vaccine Then Changes Mind,3676,"One of the reasons why so many people have had it with all this coronavirus hysteria is because of the mixed messages we keep getting from people in top government offices. The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Robert Redfield, was testifying in front of Congress where he made some weird statements about masks and vaccines before finally reversing himself on those statements. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield testified that mask-wearing may be a more effective protection against coronavirus than a vaccine, adding that the American public has not yet embraced the use of masks to a level that could effectively control the outbreak https://t.co/q9KiaKxCLm ‚Äî CNN (@CNN) September 16, 2020 CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield makes it as clear as he can: ""This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine."" pic.twitter.com/Ul0Ppj5qqv ‚Äî The Recount (@therecount) September 16, 2020 He then posted a tweet talking about how important he thinks vaccines are. I 100% believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a #COVID19 vaccine. A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life. ‚Äî Dr. Robert R. Redfield (@CDCDirector) September 16, 2020 So I guess he wants people to wear masks and take vaccines? It‚Äôs hard to know what he actually means with all this. Back in February, this same guy was telling people not to buy or wear masks. Statements that totally contradict everything he is saying now. CDC's Redfield, 2/27/20:
1) Healthy ppl should not wear *any* masks
2) Lectures Americans: ""I see people feeling the need to go buy masks ‚Ä¶ It really does displease me to find ppl going out [& buying medical-grade masks] ‚Ä¶ there's no role for these masks in the community."" pic.twitter.com/9NxT4ZWpOq ‚Äî Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) September 17, 2020 Back then, nobody knew what the coronavirus was or how bad it was and I thought that it was weird for people in government to discourage people who felt unsafe to not buy or wear masks. Such a thing should have been a personal choice. But now that we have more information about what we are dealing with, it is obvious that these cloth masks are not effective. Yet despite that, numerous people in government are forcing healthy people to wear masks against their will for no definitive health reason. The fact that the head of the CDC doesn‚Äôt understand any of this is insane and shows that he has no idea what he is talking about. He like Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx have been wrong about the coronavirus the entire time and they continue to be wrong. This fiasco also led Donald Trump to tell the media that he thought Redfield was confused about the vaccine. ‚ÄúI think he made a mistake when he said that.‚Äù Trump says CDC Director Robert Redfield was ‚Äúconfused‚Äù when he said November/December would be when a vaccine could be available and that general public won‚Äôt get it til next year. pic.twitter.com/jvt6Y98wEV ‚Äî Bloomberg QuickTake (@QuickTake) September 16, 2020 The media has used this to attack Trump for not listening to experts or whatever. All of this is so dumb. Masks have proven to be worthless and there is no reason to rush out a vaccine for something that has proven to be no more dangerous than the flu. It‚Äôs sickening that Trump has to go along with all this nonsense because the media has brainwashed a majority of the population into believing this is all real. Everything about the coronavirus is a lie. Nothing these government bureaucrats say about the coronavirus can be trusted. The CDC head‚Äôs weird contradictory statements and reversals proves this yet again."
WHO Admits Bill Gates Vaccine is Spreading Polio in Africa,1920,"The World Health Organization has been forced to admit that a polio vaccine championed by Bill Gates and friends has actually caused an outbreak of polio in Africa. AP: The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad ‚Äî a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan ‚Äî one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea ‚Äî were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. This has to be quite embarrassing for Bill Gates and crew considering how they‚Äôre trying to push a coronavirus vaccine on everyone. Attention: this is no longer a conspiracy theory ‚Äì these people are reckless. Vulnerable #Africa countries are now struggling to contain outbreaks of ""vaccine-derived"" #polio ‚Äì a massive #vaccine projected funded by #BillGates‚Ä¶ #COVID19 #coronavirus https://t.co/V2CV3VUpP3 ‚Äî Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) September 4, 2020 But who knows, they probably don‚Äôt give a shit about the optics of this since the vast majority of people are stupid and think Bill Gates is a wonderful person. I however, do not think Bill Gates is a wonderful person. I personally think he is a piece of shit and a weird asshole. Not just for his role in promoting weird vaccines, but for his role in creating shitty computer operating systems like Windows Vista. The bottom line is this, if a Bill Gates promoted vaccine is giving third world populations polio, why the hell would you want to take any other vaccine that he pushes? You‚Äôd be insane to take anything he recommends."
NYT: 90 Percent of Coronavirus Tests Gave False Positives,1312,"The New York Times recently ran a story detailing how all of this coronavirus testing is grossly unreliable. They even talked about how 90 percent of tests in a few different states reported false positives. Up to 90 percent of people who test positive for the coronavirus are highly unlikely to spread it to others, according to data from two states. What should we do about that?¬† https://t.co/uIttDljmGD ‚Äî NYT Health (@NYTHealth) August 29, 2020 Fun fact: at $150 a test (the true cost is likely higher), the US is now spending almost $1 billion EVERY WEEK on #Covid tests.

Don't kid yourself: #Covid has become a HUGE business.https://t.co/6Sx0VooCbs. ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) September 1, 2020 The unreliability of the testing is a fact we‚Äôve already known, but it is fairly shocking to see it reported in The New York Times of all places. Since so many people accepted this dumb hoax in the first place, all the damage they meant to do with this scam has already been done. Even if 100 percent of the American people woke up to this fraud, it wouldn‚Äôt matter a whole lot. The entire economy has been destroyed and you have morons still running around wearing masks everywhere they go thinking that they are going to die of the plague."
California Outlaws Flavored Vape Juice,1444,"Gavin Newsom is such a stupid faggot. He has totally destroyed the state with his retarded policies but has the time to brag about signing a bill that bans flavored vape juice.

The economic destruction has resulted in mass joblessness, an increase in drug use, a surge in suicides and all sorts of other bad things. None of these things have been good for people‚Äôs health. Even before the virus hoax, nothing was done about all the drug addicted zombies that were roaming around the streets of San Francisco, Los Angeles and other California cities. Issues with hard drugs and opioids has been a far more pressing matter than anything related to flavored vape juice. Any moron can see this. So for him to claim that he cares about public health by banning vape juice is the height of absurdity. Plus all this ban is going to do is create an underground black market for flavored vape juice. People like Newsom have no credibility on the issue of public health due to their role in destroying people‚Äôs health."

Virginia Wants to Make All Residents Take Coronavirus Vaccine,1297,"The Virginia Health Commissioner is saying that he wants to make whatever coronavirus vaccine that is developed mandatory for all Virginia residents.

Why does that term only seem to apply to murdering infants but not things like masks and vaccines? These are rhetorical questions of course. We are dealing with evil people who don‚Äôt care about lies and how hypocritical they look. There is no reason to mandate vaccines for the entire population for something that is no more dangerous than the flu. Yet they are doing this regardless of the data. It proves once again that the forced vaccination agenda is real. Regardless of the consequences, I will never take a coronavirus vaccine. Even if the consequence is death. Seriously, fuck all these people promoting this madness. They all deserve to burn in hell."
Russia is Manufacturing a Coronavirus Vaccine,2354,"Russia has announced that they have developed a coronavirus vaccine and are actively manufacturing it. RT: The Russian Health Ministry announced on Saturday that production of the world‚Äôs first registered coronavirus vaccine has begun. It‚Äôs been named ‚ÄòSputnik V‚Äô after the famed space satellite, launched by Moscow in 1957. The formula, officially known as ‚ÄòGam-COVID-Vak,‚Äô¬†was developed by the Gamaleya National Research Center in the Russian capital. It has two components that need to be injected three weeks apart to trigger an immune response to Covid-19. The¬†director¬†of Russia‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, which bankrolled the project, Kirill Dmitriev pointed out that¬†Moscow¬†had received applications for more than one billion doses of the vaccine from 20 countries. Russia‚Äôs health regulator registered the vaccine after it passed Phase II trials in June and July. It was decided that¬†completing a Phase III trial was not necessary for the initial roll-out because it is based on an already proven platform. However, it‚Äôs important to note that Sputnik V won‚Äôt go into general circulation until January 2021, allowing another four to five months in which to further observe its effectiveness. The decision was criticized by some Western governments and health professionals, who consider it rushed and potentially dangerous. That said, some of them seemed to be under the impression that the vaccine was going into immediate mass circulation. In reality, it will initially only be available to vulnerable workers in important frontline roles. Even then, participation is voluntary, with nobody forced to take part. The West is already claiming that the vaccine is potentially dangerous and might not work. I‚Äôm not sure how they can make such claims without running proper tests, which proves that their claims have much more to do with politics than the actual science surrounding the vaccine. Because let‚Äôs be honest, the real reason Russia‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine is being dumped on is because it interferes in whatever plan Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci have for their own separate vaccine. Whatever the case, I think anybody voluntarily taking any of these coronavirus vaccines is insane. Although, I think taking whatever vaccine Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci promote is much more insane than taking the vaccine being manufactured by the Russians."
CDC Says Virus Has Caused Americans to Become Depressed,2300,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is saying that Americans have become depressed and are turning to alcohol because of the coronavirus. They are essentially admitting that there is a mental health crisis in the country. Yahoo News: The coronavirus pandemic has led to a marked deterioration in Americans‚Äô mental health, according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study made public on Thursday. That study, which surveyed 5,412 Americans, found that ‚Äú40.9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition.‚Äù According to the new study, 31 percent of respondents were suffering from symptoms of anxiety or depression; 26 percent experienced symptoms of traumatic disorder; 13 percent were using drugs or alcohol more heavily, or for the first time, to cope with the pandemic; and 11 percent had seriously contemplated suicide. ‚ÄúYounger adults, racial/ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers reported having experienced disproportionately worse‚Äù mental health outcomes than other groups, the study concluded. These findings represented levels of psychological distress higher relative to pre-pandemic levels. Anxiety symptoms tripled in incidence compared with the same period in 2019; the incidence of depression symptoms quadrupled. The rate of serious suicidal thoughts doubled in comparison to levels recorded in 2018. Significantly, more than 90 percent said they were not being treated for anxiety, depression or posttraumatic stress disorder before the pandemic struck, meaning that their symptoms arrived with the coronavirus and its attendant social disruptions. I have no doubt that these problems are real. What the CDC gets wrong is blaming the coronavirus for this. All of these issues are not because of the virus, they are the result of the lunatic decisions made by the government in response to the coronavirus. In fact, pretty much every single decision that has been made is what I would have personally done if it was my goal to cause society to go completely insane. This virus is literally no more dangerous than the flu and primarily impacts old people and people with pre-existing conditions. This has not caused anybody to go insane. The lockdown measures is the source of the insanity."
Dutch Doctors Say No Evidence Masks Stop Spread of Coronavirus,1391,"In the Netherlands there is no government mandate demanding its people wear these retarded face diapers over their faces at all times in public.

I was even critical of the government telling people not to wear masks. That‚Äôs because nobody knew what we are dealing with. But now that we know more about the coronavirus, it is clear that wearing a cloth mask doesn‚Äôt do much. We have all sorts of mask mandates all over the United States and the coronavirus continues to spread. At this point, it is just best to let the virus run its course so we can develop herd immunity. It isn‚Äôt like we are dealing with the doomsday plague here. It is literally no more dangerous than the flu. But as we know, there are other agendas at play and your personal health and well being is not among them."
New York City Overflowing With Garbage Now,2181,"At this point I have no idea why anybody would want to live in New York City. The city government decided to close much of the city‚Äôs economy so people wouldn‚Äôt catch the flu. The city has been rendered unlivable. After forcing numerous businesses out of business, there is far less tax revenue coming in. This means the city will have to cut budgets or even suspend basic city services. Take for instance what‚Äôs happened with trash removal. The city is overflowing with garbage because they slashed the city‚Äôs sanitation budget by millions of dollars. CBS NY: Trash has been piling up all over New York City less than a month after the sanitation department‚Äôs budget was slashed by millions. If you‚Äôve been noticing more trash spilling out of the baskets on each corner later or rolling on the streets like tumbleweeds even more than usual, you‚Äôre not alone. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs more than ever,‚Äù said Stella Pando, in Hamilton Heights. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs outrageous. A lot of rats come in, a lot of mice, roaches. They gotta do something about this,‚Äù Hector Vasquez, of Harlem, said. Two raccoons were spotted feasting on an overflowing bin the other night outside a Hamilton Heights playground. ‚ÄúThe city right now, and especially in New York, we‚Äôre being hailed for doing so great with public health and all these things, but I don‚Äôt think you can say we‚Äôre doing that well with public health ‚Äôcause when you have garbage everywhere, it‚Äôs also a public health issue,‚Äù said Adam Goldenberg, of Harlem. In June, the city cut $106 million from the sanitation department‚Äòs budget, reducing pickup for public litter baskets by 60%. The Jew Goldenberg makes a good point. The city used the force of government to close businesses in the name of public health but now doesn‚Äôt have the resources to deal with basic sanitation. This is obviously not good for public health because it greatly increases the risk of disease spreading. The situation is utterly insane. We can only hope that the lack of trash removal services will cause the city‚Äôs Jewish population to relocate to Israel. Even though that is probably wishful thinking, that would be one of the few good things that could potentially come of this."
Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Rally Blamed for Herman Cain‚Äôs Death,1532,"Herman Cain the 70-something black Republican who attended Donald Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally just passed away after he tested positive for the coronavirus.

He could have died from almost anything and at anytime considering his age and his health. Yet, Trump is being blamed for his death because Cain chose to attend the rally. There‚Äôs also no proof that Cain caught the coronavirus at the rally. He could have literally caught it anywhere. It‚Äôs just more political stupidity designed to promote this gay virus hoax. These same people aren‚Äôt raising any alarm bells about all the retarded ceremonies and events that are being held to honor the communist nigger John Lewis. They only make these bizarre virus claims about right-wing related events. Perhaps these faggots can give us the science on what makes the coronavirus infect people only at right-wing political events and not left-wing political events. I would love to see the evidence they have that proves this strange theory."
British Study Says Lockdown Was Not Worth It,1233,"When these lunatic lockdown measures were imposed around the world, I said that the economic consequences would be far worse than anything the virus could do. Now we have a British study concluding what was obvious to anybody with a brain. Daily Mail: The spiralling cost of lockdown has not been worth the lives saved in stark economic terms, a leading economist has warned. The damage to the economy is an astonishing ¬£70billion greater than the value of the years of life saved, when applying an NHS formula. The study by former Bank of England policymaker David Miles, with co-authors Mike Stedman and Adrian Heald, urges the Government to ditch blanket lockdown policies designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Far more lives have been destroyed as a result of the destroyed economy versus the alleged doomsday plague. There is no debating this. All they had to do was isolate the elderly and people with preexisting conditions. Healthy people could have been left alone to continue going about their business. But no, instead this was part of an agenda to destroy the world economy and bring in a weird dystopic nightmare. It has never been about protecting people‚Äôs health and anybody who still thinks that is an idiot."
NJ Gym Owners Arrested for Defying Illegal Lockdown Orders,1180,"A couple of New Jersey gym owners who have been defying the illegal lockdown orders by the lunatic state governor Phil Murphy were just arrested.

He is the one who should be arrested for issuing illegal and unconstitutional orders. Unfortunately, we have lots of scum police who do what they‚Äôre told which is why these gym owners were arrested. In New Jersey, Murphy is allowing people to sell alcohol but is refusing to let gyms operate. As if the alleged virus plague doesn‚Äôt spread in liquor stores and only in gyms. This policy is deliberately destructive and was not put in place for the benefit of anyone‚Äôs health. If anything, this is a policy meant to destroy people‚Äôs health. This whole thing is such a crazy hoax that it is hard to fathom. The people who pushed this hoax should be hung by their neck until they‚Äôre dead."
Extra Unemployment Aid Comes to an End,1478,"The American economy has plunged into a depression and we haven‚Äôt even seen the full impact of it. The extra unemployment aid that was approved by the government, came to an end today and the consequences of this are not going to be good. AP: As public health officials warned Friday that the coronavirus posed new risks to parts of the Midwest and South, enhanced federal payments that helped avert financial ruin for millions of unemployed Americans were set to expire ‚Äî leaving threadbare safety nets offered by individual states to catch them. Since early in the pandemic, the federal government has added $600 to the weekly unemployment checks that states send. That increase ends this week, and with Congress still haggling over next steps, most states will not be able to offer nearly as much. What are these millions of people going to do? There are no jobs because state governments have issued all sorts of insane lockdown orders that have forced businesses to close. And without this additional government assistance, millions of people are going to have a hard time just being able to afford food and shelter. We are going to see many millions of desperate people throughout America and desperate people will do desperate things. This is not going to be a good situation for anybody. Even if you are one of the people who are fortunate enough to have a job, assets and what not, security is going to become an increasing concern no matter how much your net worth is."
Bill Gates Says Multiple Doses of Coronavirus Vaccines Will Be Required,1685,"Bill Gates a man who made a fortune off of shitty computer software, is now telling us that we will need to take multiple vaccine doses in order to be safe from the coronavirus. He‚Äôs also shilling all the ridiculous social distancing and mask bullshit. Daily Mail: Bill Gates has warned that any vaccine against coronavirus could take several doses to be effective, as he described ‚Äòserious mistakes‚Äô made by the Trump administration and said some schools may not be back to normal until the fall of 2021. The Microsoft founder, who now directs much of his time and energy to his global health foundation, said that the closure of schools was, after deaths, the ‚Äòbiggest cost‚Äô of the pandemic. And, in an interview with Norah O‚ÄôDonnell on CBS News, aired on Wednesday night, the Seattle-based billionaire was critical of Donald Trump‚Äôs handling of the crisis. ‚ÄòSome of the policies were a mistake,‚Äô said Gates. ‚ÄòOpening up bars ‚Äì the economic benefit versus the infection risk ‚Äì a lot of policies like that made it a mistake.‚Äô Gates, 64, emphasized that key to combating the virus was social distancing, wearing masks, and developing a vaccine. His foundation has donated $300 million to support the efforts. Why the fuck is this asshole being treated as if he is some sort of health expert? He is not a medical doctor nor does he have any significant background in medicine. The fact that he wants people to take multiple vaccine doses for something that is no more dangerous than the flu is insane. I‚Äôm not going to pretend to know what this guy is actually up to but we can safely assume that whatever it is, it has nothing to do with him being concerned about your personal health."
Washington Post Claims Coronavirus is Destroying America,1045,"The Washington Post which is nothing more than a propaganda outlet for Jeff Bezos and Amazon, put out a piece talking about how the coronavirus is destroying America. It‚Äôs some of the most incoherent bullshit imaginable. The people who wrote this should be embarrassed and their families should disown them. America is not being destroyed by the coronavirus. The coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu. The idea that it is the plague of doom is a hoax. What‚Äôs really destroying America is the government shutting everything down and forcing weird agendas down everyone‚Äôs throats. The media hysteria along with the government‚Äôs insane response to it is what is really destroying the country. The fact that they can‚Äôt or refuse to recognize the obvious reality of the situation proves that real journalism does not exist in the mainstream. Everything is about promoting Jewish anti-American, anti-White, anti-Trump agendas. Claiming that the coronavirus is the death plague fits into this. Truth and reality does not matter to these people."
More Retail Chains Requiring Customers to Wear Masks,1187,"After Walmart made the retarded business decision requiring shoppers to wear masks at their shitty stores, other chains are following suit. Target, CVS and Publix are among them. Target and CVS Health join the list of large retailers that will require customers to wear masks as cases of COVID-19 spike. Target's face mask policy will go into effect Aug. 1, and all CVS stores will begin requiring them on Monday. https://t.co/19R0Dpymdh ‚Äî The Associated Press (@AP) July 16, 2020 This is so dumb. Perhaps these retailers can explain the science that is behind this decision. What evidence is there that healthy people wearing masks will stop the flu from spreading? We were told earlier this year that masks were not effective at stopping the coronavirus. But now they want healthy people to wear them. This despite the fact that we now know this is no more dangerous than the flu and is for all intents and purposes just the flu. Deaths related to this are also way down. So what‚Äôs next? Am I going to be required to show proof that I‚Äôve received the satanic Bill Gates coronavirus vaccine to shop?

Businesses are Treating Anti-Maskers Like Niggers,2667,"There‚Äôs this bizarre trend that has emerged where businesses are basically treating people who refuse to wear a mask like they‚Äôre some sort of nigger. Even though there is no law, airliners are forcing people to wear a mask otherwise they are refusing them service and tossing them off their flights. I was just removed from my flight for not wearing a mask. 1st time this has happened. Not a federal law. @AmericanAir staff standing over me telling me it‚Äôs THE LAW. So much for ‚Äúplease respect those who can not wear a mask‚Äù. When I pointed out this wasn‚Äôt a law I was removed. ‚Äî Brandon Straka (@BrandonStraka) June 17, 2020 People today have also been making a big deal out of Ted Cruz not wearing a mask on a flight. Although, he may have just taken off his mask to drink a cup of coffee. .@AmericanAir Why is Ted Cruz exempted from the face mask requirement aboard American Airlines flights? Is it because he is a US Senator? Were crew ordered to let him do as he pleases? Is there any sanction at all? What was the penalty for other passengers removed from flights? ‚Äî Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) July 13, 2020 There‚Äôs also many examples of stores across the country putting up signs saying ‚Äúno mask, no service.‚Äù Some gyms and restaurants are putting up signs asking people to wear a mask entering and exiting the building even though you are allowed to take off your mask when working out or eating. It is literally the dumbest policy imaginable. What evidence is there that this absolutely retarded policy limits the spread of the doomsday virus? The whole thing feels like shit that was put into place to cause chaos and to drive people insane. Some places have these signs up just so they won‚Äôt get harassed by local government tyrants. Others, actually enforce this bullshit policy. Today, I was personally refused service at a local restaurant I used to eat at off and on for over ten years. They literally had a couple of waitresses guarding the place like it was Fort Knox looking at me like I was Satan for not wearing a mask when I entered the building. Needless to say, they will never get my business again and judging from the empty parking lot, I wasn‚Äôt the only one who felt that way. There are also some people who legitimately can‚Äôt wear a mask for health reasons unrelated to the coronavirus. So these businesses are discriminating against people who can‚Äôt wear a mask or refuse to wear one because they correctly view this virus nonsense as a bullshit hoax. It‚Äôs so dumb. People who don‚Äôt wear a mask don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like a nigger. Lawsuits should be filed against the businesses that implement these discriminatory policies."
Trump Sets 2021 Date for WHO Withdrawal,635,"So Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a withdrawal from the World Health Organization won‚Äôt take effect until July 6, 2021.

Republican Leadership Minus Trump Cucks on Masks,1570,"Here‚Äôs another example of how Republicans are the biggest bunch of useless pussies.

They could have simply said that it is a person‚Äôs individual choice and left it at that. But no, instead they totally caved. The virus is already out in the wild and millions of people already have it. Wearing a mask isn‚Äôt going to change the ultimate outcome of this. This is all about social control and has nothing to do with public health. Republicans have totally folded on this issue because they fear the Jewish media narrative about them spreading the doom plague. They‚Äôve literally been scared into promoting a Democrat political agenda. I honestly can‚Äôt take this any more. When the communists that have taken over the Democrat Party demand the American flag be banned and pedophilia legalized, you‚Äôll probably see a number of Republicans go along with it. They‚Äôll be afraid of being called a racist pedophobe or whatever."
Supreme Court Issues Another Pro-Abortion Ruling,2558,"The Supreme Court has once again agreed that murdering babies is a human right. Just like these stupid ass cunts in the above picture are claiming. John Roberts sided with the Jewish communists agreeing that abortion is a great thing and must be made available to as many stupid sluts as possible. CNBC: The Supreme Court on Monday voted 5-4 to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion measure in a major win for reproductive rights activists, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court‚Äôs four liberals. Justice Stephen Breyer, who authored an opinion joined by his fellow Democratic appointees, wrote that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. Roberts wrote separately to say his thinking was based on the court‚Äôs precedent. The case involved a Louisiana abortion law requiring doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. Challengers of the law alleged the restriction would limit the state to just one abortion provider at a single clinic. The dispute was the first over abortion to be argued before President Donald Trump‚Äôs two appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. It came just four years after the top court ruled that a similar abortion law passed in Texas was unconstitutional. In that 2016 case, Whole Woman‚Äôs Health v. Hellerstedt, the court struck down the Texas law by a 5-3 vote. Roberts voted at the time to uphold the law. In his opinion on Monday, Roberts said that the legal doctrine known as stare decisis, or the principle of adhering to precedent, ‚Äúrequires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons,‚Äù Roberts wrote. ‚ÄúTherefore Louisiana‚Äôs law cannot stand under our precedents.‚Äù If murdering babies is a human right, than is it a human right to murder dumb cunts who believe murdering babies is a human right? Just asking the question. Because basically the Supreme Court has said that murder is perfectly proper under specific circumstances with all these retarded decisions. And why isn‚Äôt the issue of abortion being decided at the state level? This is not something that should be decided at the federal level. But since we‚Äôve pretty much abolished the Constitution because everyone is scared of the flu, I guess this discussion probably doesn‚Äôt even matter. Shit just happens arbitrarily and it seems to almost always go in favor of whatever the Jews and communists want."
EU to Ban American Travelers Because of the Coronavirus,582,"The European Union is apparently going to ban American travelers because of the coronavirus. BREAKING: EU to ban US travelers due to spike in coronavirus cases, source says. https://t.co/s4pfh2Fx5v ‚Äî ABC News (@ABC) June 26, 2020 This reeks of a political decision. The coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu. This is more about hurting Donald Trump and his ability to get reelected than it has anything to do with public health. And the EU claiming that the coronavirus is such a big problem in America plays into that. Everything about the coronavirus has been politicized."
Russia Fines Radio Station for Spreading Fake News,2272,"Russia despite its flaws as a country has not gone totally insane over the past few months. They actively punish media operations which do not have the best interests of the Russian people in mind. AP: Russian opposition-leaning radio station Echo Moskvy and its website editor have been fined the equivalent of $3,745 for posting the comments of a political analyst who questioned Russia‚Äôs coronavirus statistics. The station‚Äôs chief editor Alexei Venediktov tweeted Friday that a Moscow court handed a $2,880 fine to the radio station and a $865 fine to its website editor Vitaly Ruvinsky ‚Äúfor publishing the statement of political analyst Valery Solovei,‚Äù adding that Echo Moskvy planned to appeal the ruling. According to court filings, the fines were issued for ‚Äúdisseminating deliberate‚Ä¶ misinformation‚Äù and ‚Äúcreating a threat to the life and (or) health of the people.‚Äù If only this type of thing could be done here in the United States. We have literal fake news operations like CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times etc.. that are not punished for spreading lies and hoaxes to the American public. What they have done by promoting these endless hoaxes is criminal but they have not been held accountable under the guise that the hoaxes they are pushing somehow represent ‚Äúfree speech.‚Äù Deliberately promoting hoaxes is not ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù as they claim. It is open subversion and what they are doing is not legitimate journalism. Legitimate journalism is about finding the truth regardless of what that truth is. All these operations do is push lies for the purposes of destroying the country and advancing Jewish Marxist doctrine. But going back to Russia and the question of coronavirus statistics. I believe Russia‚Äôs coronavirus statistics are more accurate than what is being reported by the United States. That‚Äôs because we know for a fact that the American death numbers are wildly inflated. Either way, the whole coronavirus situation has been an overhyped hoax designed to transform society and turn everything into some type of weird dystopia. Russia should not have gone a long with this bullshit as long as they did. It was a missed opportunity on their part. But it is good that they are going after people who are falsely claiming that this is a major crisis."
WHO Claims ‚ÄúPandemic‚Äù is in ‚ÄúNew and Dangerous Phase‚Äù,1530,"The World Health Organization is claiming this pandemic hoax is in a ‚Äúnew and dangerous phase.‚Äù Daily Mail: The coronavirus pandemic is in a ‚Äònew and dangerous phase,‚Äô the World Health Organisation said today, as the virus continues to accelerate while lockdowns are eased. Thursday‚Äôs 150,000 new cases is the highest so far in a single day and nearly half of them are in the Americas, the WHO said. ‚ÄòThe world is in a new and dangerous phase,‚Äô WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing in Geneva. ‚ÄòThe virus is still spreading fast, it is still deadly, and most people are still susceptible.‚Äô Keep in mind, the coronavirus is literally no more dangerous than the flu. This is the WHO promoting mass hysteria for no reason and to set the stage for a supposed second wave. It is very likely that when we enter the next flu season, they‚Äôre going to demand everything be locked down again in order to drive people into a state of insanity. The World Health Organization does not give a shit about your personal health. They‚Äôve been wrong about this thing the entire time and they are not to be taken seriously. They‚Äôve also shifted their positions on the coronavirus numerous times. Just a few weeks ago, they were downplaying the significance of the coronavirus since the focus was on advancing the black race riot agenda. They are a politically tainted institution dedicated to promoting this deranged global communist revolution that‚Äôs underway. This flu hoax is playing a big part in advancing this revolution."
CrossFit CEO Out After Criticizing FLOYD-19 Cult,2732,"The CEO of CrossFit Greg Glassman is out because he dared criticize the cult of George Floyd and all the insanity surrounding it.

The entire Negro-worshipping cult of George Floyd has directed all of their energy to destroying this man because he had a difference of opinion with them and made a joke. Personally, I think CrossFit is a weird fitness cult. I never understood the value of mixing all these different types of cardio and strength exercises together in the way that they do it.¬† But even still, I don‚Äôt believe the CEO and founder of the brand should have been forced out over his personal opinions on the coronavirus or George Floyd. This is cancel culture gone to the most extreme limits. This type of thing can‚Äôt continue. We are heading into the worst economic catastrophe the country has ever seen. People won‚Äôt have the energy to do this type of virtue signaling much longer. They‚Äôll be too busy trying to find food to eat, instead of worrying if someone said something politically incorrect on the Internet. It‚Äôs all so dumb and tiring."
WHO: Asymptomatic Transmission of Coronavirus is ‚ÄúVery Rare‚Äù,1681,"The World Health Organization is a total joke. They are a political organization, not a health organization.

No face diapers, not now, not ever. pic.twitter.com/ZpKXW8EGBh ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) June 9, 2020 The main reason why the WHO has reversed its course is that the Jewish narrative has shifted from making people scared of the flu to promoting race riots. So now they‚Äôre downplaying the threat of the coronavirus so people can‚Äôt say that the rioters and looters are helping spread a dangerous plague. You see, people protesting unconstitutional lockdowns were evil COVIDIOTS. But looters and rioters are seeking social justice. So the official stance of the WHO has to reflect this narrative. All of this is just so insane and retarded, I honestly can‚Äôt handle it. But hey, at least the stock market is up!"

WHO Claims Lifting Lockdowns is Dangerous,1514,"The World Health Organization is pushing for the lockdowns to continue. Daily Mail: The World Health Organization has warned there could be a ‚Äòsecond peak‚Äô of infections in America and Europe where coronavirus is declining if lockdown restrictions are relaxed too soon. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the WHO, issued the grave warning in an online briefing Monday saying that while cases are declining in many countries, these nations could still face an ‚Äòimmediate second peak‚Äô if they let up too soon on measures to halt the outbreak. Ryan also warned that several countries in Central and South America, South Asia and Africa are continuing to record spikes in cases. This came the same day that the WHO announced it¬†is suspending its trial of hydoxychloroquine in coronavirus patients amid safety concerns over the anti-malaria drug. What a worthless institution. They were wrong about the coronavirus the entire time and they‚Äôre wrong about the lockdowns. The lockdowns seem to have exacerbated the spread because they forced more people into enclosed spaces prompting the virus to spread. The phenomenon is no different than what happened on all those cruise ships and in nursing homes. And all these attacks on the anti-malaria drug are getting old. They‚Äôre claiming it isn‚Äôt safe for treating coronavirus patients even though it has been in use for decades. They‚Äôre obviously bashing it because it represents an alternative to the Bill Gates satan vaccine which they want to inject everyone with."
California Doctors See More Suicides Than COVID-19 Deaths,1416,"You didn‚Äôt have to be a genius to predict this outcome. ABC 7: Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from the COVID-19 virus. The head of the trauma in the department believes mental health is suffering so much, it is time to end the shelter-in-place order. ‚ÄúPersonally I think it‚Äôs time,‚Äù said Dr. Mike deBoisblanc. ‚ÄúI think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering.‚Äù The numbers are unprecedented, he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean we‚Äôve seen a year‚Äôs worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.‚Äù I was saying for the past two months that the lockdown was going to cause more deaths than the virus itself. Anybody of reasonable intelligence could see that this was going to be the ultimate outcome. And here we are seeing this prediction come true. The state governors who are continuing these insane lockdowns are responsible for the deaths of these people. The fact that they are continuing these lockdowns despite us knowing for a fact that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu, shows that what they are doing is a high crime."
CDC Estimated Flu-Like .26% COVID-19 Death Rate,1370,"It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see how all the kooks claiming that the coronavirus is the plague of doom are going to respond to this.

Throughout this alleged virus crisis we had empty hospitals and bored nurses uploading retarded dance videos to TikTok. Even the emergency facilities that were setup received few if any patients.

Trump Considering Forming a Panel to Review Big Tech Bias,1264,"A Wall Street Journal report is stating that Donald Trump is considering forming a panel to review the bias of big tech firms. President Trump is considering forming a panel to review alleged anticonservative bias by tech firms, say people familiar with the matter https://t.co/ZHQEQlT47V ‚Äî The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) May 23, 2020 This is just dumb. There is no need to review what we already know is happening. These people openly admit that they are censoring content and banning people for their political beliefs. They are even banning content that contains doctors and scientists disagreeing with the World Health Organization. So what exactly do we need to review? The bias of these big tech companies against people over their political beliefs is a proven fact. Trump already has the legal authority to regulate these big tech companies via the FTC and FCC. The fact that he hasn‚Äôt done anything substantive over the past three years means that he has no plans to do anything substantive. Remember the social media summit he held last year? Well, at that time he issued an order asking the government to look into how to deal with the bias of these tech companies. Nothing came of it and nothing will come out of this even if the panel is commissioned."
The Hill Claims Government Can Approve Forced Vaccinations,2260,"There are lots of shills claiming that the government has the right to forcibly vaccinate everyone. Count Merrill Matthews from The Hill as being another one of these shills. Take a look at some of the bullshit he wrote in his recent op-ed. The Hill: When a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, I will be one of the first in line. But the fact is U.S. adults tend to have low vaccination rates. If the government determines that vaccinations are essential to stemming the spread of the disease, would it ‚Äì could it ‚Äì mandate vaccination compliance? Apparently, it can ‚Äî and it might. Many medical experts believe that developing one or more COVID-19 vaccines is the key to reopening the economy and returning to our normal lives. For example, the Mayo Clinic says, ‚ÄúA vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ The Congressional Research Service says the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that ‚ÄúThe states‚Äô general police power to promote public health and safety encompasses the authority to require mandatory vaccinations.‚Äù And states have all exercised that authority for children, usually allowing for some exceptions.¬† CRS also says, ‚ÄúCongress, as a result of various enumerated powers in the Constitution, likewise has some authority over public health matters, including regulation of vaccination.‚Äù¬† Government mandated vaccinations for adults would be a major and controversial step. But then government has taken a number of major and controversial steps recently, such as shutting down the economy. I don‚Äôt give a fuck what the Congressional Research Service says nor do I give a fuck what this freedom hating piece of shit says either. I am not taking the coronavirus vaccine and to claim that the government has the legal authority to force me or anybody else to take it is absurd. To the people who are so excited about getting a coronavirus vaccine and advocating forced vaccinations, I highly suggest that you take the coronavirus vaccine and inject it straight up your asshole. Same goes for the implantable microchip that Bill Gates wants to put inside of your body. Your asshole will be a great place for it to reside. You might even want to tattoo the word ‚Äúslave‚Äù on your forehead."

Trump Declares Reopening of ‚ÄúEssential‚Äù Churches,2139,"Donald Trump has pretty much allowed state governors to totally destroy the Constitution because of a virus that is no more dangerous than the flu. And while I understood the political gamesmanship of putting the reopening decisions on state governors, he‚Äôs basically given them a blank check to destroy America. He‚Äôs done little to nothing to fight back against all the unconstitutional abuses of power that we have seen around the country. At least yesterday he announced that churches would be considered ‚Äúessential‚Äù and demanded that states allow them to reopen. Places of worship are ESSENTIAL. President @realDonaldTrump reaffirmed his support for the First Amendment by announcing new @CDCgov guidance to allow churches, synagogues, mosques & other places of worship to re-open SAFELY. This President stands with Americans of ALL faiths! ‚Äî Kayleigh McEnany (@PressSec) May 22, 2020 How this plays out is anybody‚Äôs best guess, but at least this is a start. As expected, the Jewish media went crazy over this. Because the last thing Jews want are Christians being able to practice their faith inside a church. Jews are posting all sorts of rubbish on Twitter claiming that reopening the churches are a public health risk. Take for example the old yenta hag Barbra Streisand. Trump doesn‚Äôt believe in the separation of church and state.

As usual he cares more about politics than the public health.https://t.co/FE6PRJ6Pwm ‚Äî Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) May 22, 2020 Going to a church is no more risky than going to Walmart or Target which have been allowed to remain open during this pandemic hoax. So what these Jews are saying is absolutely retarded. But Trump really needs to do more about these unconstitutional lockdown orders. He is abdicating his responsibility as President of the United States by allowing these governors to issue such edicts which are in total violation of the Constitution. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that the Department of Justice has done next to nothing about any of this outside of writing a stern letter and posting it on Twitter."

China to Investigate Death of Their Ambassador in Israel,2067,"China is sending a team to investigate the weird death of their ambassador in Israel. Times of Israel: The Chinese government is reportedly to dispatch investigators to Israel to probe the death of its ambassador to Israel, Du Wei. died at his home in Herzliya on Sunday, apparently from natural causes, a statement from Beijing has said. A statement from China‚Äôs foreign ministry earlier said: ‚ÄúThe preliminary verdict is that Ambassador Du Wei died unexpectedly of health reasons. The details await further confirmation.‚Äù According to a Haaretz report, the special team will carry out ‚Äúan independent investigation‚Äù and will also arrange arrangements to fly Wei‚Äôs body back to China for burial. A family representative will be joining the team, the report said. The team would not be required to enter the 14-day quarantine period normally required for arrivals in Israel due to the coronavirus pandemic. Israel‚Äôs Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday morning that Du Wei, 57, had been found dead at his official residence in the coastal town of Herzliya. The Foreign Ministry said police were on the scene. According to the Ynet news site, aides tried to wake Du and found him in his bed, not breathing. The initial assessment was that he had suffered cardiac arrest during the night. Channel 12 news reported there were no external signs of violence on Du‚Äôs body. Previously, it was being reported that he died of natural causes which would be highly unusual for a man in his 50s who does not appear to be fat or out of shape. Now they‚Äôre claiming he died of a heart attack which is equally as weird. Sure, it‚Äôs possible but not very likely. Before Du Wei‚Äôs death, he made a number of critical statements about US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. I‚Äôm not going to pretend to know what happened here, but obviously if the Chinese are sending an investigation team to find out more information, they don‚Äôt believe Du Wei died of a heart attack. There is definitely a higher chance than zero that he was assassinated by the Mossad or some other intelligence operation."
Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs Weird Brother Arrested Protesting Virus Lockdown,1979,"Jeremy Corbyn the former head of the British Labour Party has a brother named Piers Corbyn who has been protesting the virus lockdown in the United Kingdom. He was arrested during a recent demonstration in London‚Äôs Hyde Park. üö® Jeremy Corbyn's brother was arrested during an anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park yesterday üì£ Piers Corbyn was heard claiming that 5G and coronavirus are linked üìå Follow the latest coronavirus news here: https://t.co/2d3zjQn3Ro pic.twitter.com/P0zXdKrivR ‚Äî The Telegraph (@Telegraph) May 17, 2020 The weird thing about this guy is that he‚Äôs promoting this strange idea that 5G technology is helping spread the coronavirus. There are many reasons to be skeptical of 5G technology, but the idea that 5G is helping spread the coronavirus is lunatic-tier nonsense. There is no proof of this. Plus, we know that the coronavirus is no more deadly than the flu, so even if 5G was somehow doing this, it isn‚Äôt something worth focusing on. The radiation emitted from 5G antennas is however a legitimate health concern and one that has not been adequately addressed. It is also possible that the rush to setup 5G is linked to a broader agenda designed to expand the existing surveillance grid. And this would be achieved through a combination of broad 5G network coverage that links to people‚Äôs mobile phones or even implantable microchips (god forbid). So it appears as if this bizarre theory about 5G spreading the coronavirus is being intentionally promoted by people like Piers Corbyn to discredit legitimate concerns about 5G itself. It‚Äôs sort of like what happened in the years that followed the 9/11 attacks. There were countless legitimate reasons to question the official story, but those legitimate reasons were mixed in with all sorts of strange theories that couldn‚Äôt be proven. And those strange theories were used by the Jewish media to make the average person think that anybody who questioned the official story believed in crackpot nonsense."
WHO Claims ‚ÄúDeadly‚Äù Second Coronavirus Wave to Hit Europe,1708,"The World Health Organization is claiming with no evidence that there will be a ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù second coronavirus wave to hit Europe. Telegraph: European countries should brace themselves for a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections because the pandemic is not over, the World Health Organisation‚Äôs top official in Europe has said. In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, delivered a stark warning to countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions, saying that now is the ‚Äútime for preparation, not celebration‚Äù. Dr Kluge stressed that, as the number of cases of Covid-19 in countries such as the UK, France and Italy was beginning to fall, it did not mean the pandemic was coming to an end. The epicentre of the European outbreak is now in the east, with the number of cases rising in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, he warned. Countries should use this time wisely and start to strengthen public health systems as well as building capacity in hospitals, primary care and intensive care units, he said. Yeah, so basically you will see a partial return to normalcy over the summer and into the fall and then they‚Äôre going to claim we need to lock everything down again. The thing is, we have lots of data on this now and we know that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu. That‚Äôs even if you take into account all these inflated death numbers that we are being given by governments. The WHO and the other people who promoted this pandemic hoax are going to have a difficult time justifying additional lockdowns. There are lots of people wise to this hoax as evidenced by the growing number of protests around the world."
YouTube Censors Epidemiologist For Opposing Virus Lockdown,2842,"The official policy of Jewish YouTube is to ban and delete any material from doctors and scientists who disagree with the World Health Organization. This story here is yet another example of this insane censorship. NY Post: Big Tech companies are aggressively tamping down on COVID-19 ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù ‚Äî opinions and ideas contrary to official pronouncements. Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski, former head of biostatistics, epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University, says YouTube removed a video of him talking about the virus which had racked up more than 1.3 million views. Wittkowski, 65, is a ferocious critic of the nation‚Äôs current steps to fight the coronavirus. He has derided social distancing, saying it only prolongs the virus‚Äô existence and has attacked the current lockdown as mostly unnecessary. Wittkowski, who holds two doctorates in computer science and medical biometry, believes the coronavirus should be allowed to achieve ‚Äúherd immunity,‚Äù and that short of a vaccine the pandemic will only end after it has sufficiently spread through the population. ‚ÄúWith all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won‚Äôt even have recognized that they were infected,‚Äù he says in the now-deleted video. ‚ÄúI was just explaining what we had,‚Äù Wittkowski told The Post of the video, saying he had no idea why it was removed. The footage was produced by the British film company Journeyman Pictures. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt tell you. They just say it violates our community standards. There‚Äôs no explanation for what those standards are or what standards it violated.‚Äù In articles and interviews across the web, he has likened COVID-19 to a ‚Äúbad flu.‚Äù That likely made him a target for YouTube, which said in April it would be ‚Äúremoving information that is problematic‚Äù about the pandemic.
see also Tech giants can help save us from coronavirus ‚Äî but should we let them?
‚ÄúAnything that goes against [World Health Organization] recommendations would be a violation of our policy and so removal is another really important part of our policy,‚Äù CEO Susan Wojcicki told CNN. If this doesn‚Äôt show how extreme the Jewish censorship agenda is on the coronavirus hoax than nothing will. For all this talk about following data and science, it is interesting how they have adopted a policy of banning videos showing doctors and scientists who are simply offering their professional views on the coronavirus. This is not how you follow science. Jewish YouTube obviously wants the entire population afraid of this virus which has proven to be no more dangerous than the flu. Anything that counters this narrative must be deleted. The banned video can be viewed here on the website for the American Institute for Economic Research."
Trump Claims He‚Äôs Working On Ending Big Tech Censorship,2406,"Donald Trump claimed today that his administration is working on a solution to end the censorship that exists on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google-related sites. His tweet included a short now deleted video of Michelle Malkin talking about all the online censorship that right-wing personalities have faced. The Radical Left is in total command & control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google. The Administration is working to remedy this illegal situation. Stay tuned, and send names & events. Thank you Michelle! https://t.co/ZQfcfD3Hk9 ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2020 Just a day ago, I posted an article criticizing Trump for failing to take action on Internet censorship. This could be an indirect response to that, as I have no doubt that people within the Trump administration are aware of this site and the Daily Stormer. After all, the Jewish Anti-Defamation League listed me as one of Trump‚Äôs top racist supporters in 2016. All I‚Äôll say is that I‚Äôm highly skeptical of this. We‚Äôve waited years to see some type of government action to be taken against these companies and nothing has happened. After Charlottesville in 2017, myself and others said that these companies would begin banning more moderate right-wing figures if they did not defend our right to free speech on these sites. We are now at a point where YouTube is banning and censoring people who disagree with the World Health Organization. And on Facebook, they‚Äôre banning anti-lockdown groups. The only prominent person who defended our right to free speech at that time was Tucker Carlson. Not even Alex Jones defended us and a year later they banned him because he talked about Sandy Hook conspiracies back in 2012. So whatever, I‚Äôm not expecting the Trump administration to do anything about this problem. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have the powers to regulate these companies but those powers have not been exercised. And with this national emergency over this pandemic virus hoax we have going on, you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be even easier to exercise government authority over them. But no, instead all we see are governors around the country abolishing the Constitution as Trump‚Äôs Department of Justice sits back and does nothing. Who knows, maybe the orange man will surprise me, but I doubt it. He‚Äôs been all talk and no action on the Internet censorship issue."
‚ÄúWhistleblower‚Äù Rick Bright is Another Bill Gates Employee,3306,"Dr. Rick Bright the former head of the¬†Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is testifying in front of Congress after he was fired/demoted by the Trump administration. This asshole is just mad that he was removed from his job. He‚Äôs spreading all sorts of doom about this pandemic hoax and claiming that people died and will die because of the evil orange man. He is not a ‚Äúwhistleblower.‚Äù A government whistleblower plans to tell lawmakers the U.S. faces its ‚Äúdarkest winter in modern history‚Äù unless leaders act decisively on the coronavirus. Immunologist Dr. Rick Bright says he was ousted from his job for sounding the alarm on the pandemic. https://t.co/SDglcam65J ‚Äî The Associated Press (@AP) May 13, 2020 Hilariously, he is being represented by Debra Katz the same Jewish lawyer who represented Christine Blasey Ford. You may remember her as the dumb bitch who hoaxed a rape claim against Brett Kavanaugh a few years ago. Here is something interesting: Whistleblower Rick Bright is represented at the House coronavirus hearing today by Debra Katz. Her last high profile client? Christine Blasey Ford who first brought her story to Rep. Anna Eshoo. Eshoo is also the chair of the Health subcommittee. ‚Äî Philip Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) May 14, 2020 The orange man himself called Bright out as a disgruntled employee and that‚Äôs probably a fair description of the situation. I don‚Äôt know the so-called Whistleblower Rick Bright, never met him or even heard of him, but to me he is a disgruntled employee, not liked or respected by people I spoke to and who, with his attitude, should no longer be working for our government! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2020 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Bright failed to show up for work and that‚Äôs why he was removed from his post.

There is simply no reason to trust anybody who has been or is associated with that organization. Bill Gates is not a trustworthy person and he appears to have an agenda to forcibly vaccinate the world with some sort of satanic vaccine. This is just dumb political theater involving Bright and House Democrats. They‚Äôre using Bright‚Äôs testimony to claim that Trump didn‚Äôt move fast enough on stopping the coronavirus even though they said Trump was racist for stopping travel to and from China. They‚Äôre also using Bright‚Äôs testimony to spin a narrative that Trump doesn‚Äôt have a proper plan in place to deal with this pandemic hoax. The whole situation is stupid. This pandemic is not real. It is fake news. This whole event is being used to spread more fear and to make people believe that we are in the middle of a virus apocalypse. The fact that Bright is involved in spreading this irrational fear makes him a criminal who should be arrested and charged with crimes."
HR 6666 is Spy Plan to Forcibly Quarantine Alleged Virus Spreaders,1526,"We can fully expect to see increasingly insane things proposed as a result of this pandemic hoax. House Resolution 6666:¬†COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone is one of those insane things. You can read the bill for yourself, but it‚Äôs basically a $100 billion plan to setup and deploy mobile ‚Äúhealth‚Äù units. These ‚Äúhealth‚Äù units will go around to people‚Äôs homes where they will test, monitor and even forcibly quarantine people if they are found to be infected with the alleged doomsday virus. It‚Äôs a totally insane proposal. Basically it makes all the unconstitutional anti-terrorism surveillance measures that were enacted following the 9/11 attacks look like child‚Äôs play. This bill is talking about having literal agents of the government running around doing random ‚Äúhealth‚Äù checks on people with no warrant, probable cause etc.. It‚Äôs not exactly clear how they would roll out the testing or monitoring, let alone how they would enforce or implement the quarantines as described in the bill. But based on how evil the government is, you can expect that none of it will be good. We could be subjected to anything ranging from house arrest, to seeing people dragged off to FEMA camps where they will be injected with a 666 vaccine developed by Bill Gates. And it is impossible to ignore the 6666 numerology in this bill. This was clearly intentional. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly obvious that there are plans to implement a horrible satanic beast system and they are using this manufactured virus hoax to do it."
Americans Increasingly Turning to Drugs and Alcohol,1729,"An increasing number of Americans are turning to drugs and alcohol to cope with the fallout from this insane lockdown by the government. McClatchy: With coronavirus-related stress on the rise, so is alcohol and drug use, according to a national survey. Findings by The Recovery Village, a Florida-based network of addiction treatment facilities, reflect an ‚Äúexpected‚Äù increase in substance use during the pandemic, with Americans reporting a 55% rise in alcohol consumption in the last month. When it came to illicit drugs, 36% of Americans reported increased use of marijuana and prescription opioids, among others. ‚ÄúExperts have already started to voice concerns on the secondary effects America is yet to see from COVID-19,‚Äù researchers wrote, among them being ‚Äúincreased rates of addiction afterward due to the stress of isolation, boredom, decreased access to recovery resources and unemployment.‚Äù I‚Äôve been saying for the past few months that there‚Äôd be an increase in alcohol and drug use as a result of the insanity we are experiencing. But you didn‚Äôt have to be an expert to predict this. All you needed was some common sense. Worse yet is how numerous state governments are allowing the sale of alcohol and marijuana while keeping gyms and churches closed in the name of public health. Does this make any sense to you? We basically have people implementing policies that are making it more likely that people will engage in substance abuse. They have also decided to close places people go to in order to preserve their sanity. As more people lose their jobs in this economic calamity caused by the lockdown, many more will turn to alcohol and drugs. Some will commit suicide. All because people were afraid of the flu."
Facebook Holds Contest to Develop Anti-Hate Algorithm,3361,"The Jewish website Facebook announced that they are holding a competition for software developers to develop an anti-hate algorithm. AFP: Facebook unveiled an initiative Tuesday to take on ‚Äúhateful memes‚Äù by using artificial intelligence, backed by crowd sourcing, to identify maliciously motivated posts. The leading social network said it had already created a database of 10,000 memes ‚Äî images often blended with text to deliver a specific message ‚Äî as part of a ramped-up effort against hate speech. Facebook said it was releasing the database to researchers as part of a ‚Äúhateful memes challenge‚Äù to develop improved algorithms to detect hate-driven visual messages, with a prize pool of $100,000. ‚ÄúThese efforts will spur the broader AI research community to test new methods, compare their work, and benchmark their results in order to accelerate work on detecting multimodal hate speech,‚Äù Facebook said in a blog post. Facebook‚Äôs effort comes as it leans more heavily on AI to filter out objectionable content during the coronavirus pandemic that has sidelined most of its human moderators. Its quarterly transparency report said Facebook removed some 9.6 million posts for violating ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù policies in the first three months of this year, including 4.7 million pieces of content ‚Äúconnected to organized hate.‚Äù Facebook said AI has become better tuned at filtering as the social network turns more to machines as a result of the lockdowns. Guy Rosen, Facebook vice president for integrity, said that with AI, ‚Äúwe are able to find more content and can now detect almost 90 percent of the content we remove before anyone reports it to us.‚Äù Facebook said it made a commitment to ‚Äúdisrupt‚Äù organized hateful conduct a year ago following the deadly mosque attacks in New Zealand which prompted a ‚Äúcall to action‚Äù by governments to curb the spread of online extremism. Automated systems and artificial intelligence can be useful, Facebook said, for detecting extremist content in various languages and analyzing text embedded in images and videos to understand its full context. This contest seems like a publicity stunt more than anything else. Facebook already has enormous software development resources. So holding this competition is less about building a working censorship algorithm and more about public relations. They just want people like the Jews at the Anti-Defamation League to think that they‚Äôre taking the issue of ‚Äúonline hate‚Äù seriously. Specifically, the Jewish actor Sacha Baron Cohen has been working closely with the ADL in pushing Facebook to get even more restrictive with their censorship. This also comes after Facebook paid a $52 million settlement to their moderators who developed post-traumatic stress disorder from their censorship duties. So what they‚Äôre trying to do is automate their censorship to lessen their reliance on human moderators. But the scale of automated censorship that Facebook is attempting to implement is totally impractical. How is an algorithm supposed to detect satire? And even if you ban keywords like ‚Äúkike‚Äù or ‚Äúnigger‚Äù people will just come up with workaround terms and phrases to articulate the same meaning. Facebook has already implemented some of the most draconian censorship measures imaginable, so it is hard to see how much further they can push the limits with this, automated or not."
NIH Director Says Multiple Vaccines Needed to Defeat Virus,2095,"Here we have another person in the government bureaucracy saying that vaccines are the only solution to defeat the coronavirus. Bloomberg: Several vaccines will likely be needed to combat the coronavirus and immunize groups of people in America and abroad, U.S. National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said in an interview. Collins, 70, is a physician and geneticist who leads the agency overseeing the U.S. research response to the pandemic. He discussed efforts to develop and manufacture a vaccine, potential mutations and what they mean for immunity, and how inoculations would be tested. ‚ÄúMy expectation is, and I am a bit of an optimist, that we don‚Äôt find out that there‚Äôs only one of these vaccines that works, but rather two or three of them come through the trials looking as though they‚Äôre safe and effective,‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll have somewhat different characteristics of where they work best, so we might need to do some matching then of which vaccine goes to which particular population.‚Äù Collins, who began leading the NIH in 2009 under then-President Barack Obama, said there‚Äôs enough money to rapidly manufacture 100 million vaccine doses by late fall and 300 million before January. The first people to get a vaccine will likely be frontline health workers and those with chronic conditions that put them at greater risk from the illness. Later, Collins said, the U.S. government will have to increase manufacturing to meet global demand, and distribute vaccines to countries particularly hard-hit by the virus. The fact that we have the entire system basically saying that we can‚Äôt go back to normal until a vaccine or multiple vaccines are developed says quite a bit about the agenda. Meanwhile, any potential cures are immediately dismissed or downplayed. I‚Äôm not going to pretend to know exactly why they are so enthusiastic about vaccinating people, but you can pretty much be guaranteed that they don‚Äôt have your best interests in mind. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt take any coronavirus vaccine regardless of whatever the social or economic consequences are."

Either way, I don‚Äôt think anything will happen to Todd or NBC outside of them being subjected to the rage-tweeting of the orange man. I just wanted to cover this story since Todd is a Jew and Jews are responsible for 99 percent of the lies and fake news that circulate in the media. If Jews were banned from America the fake news would go away."
Ice Cream Shop Reopens and Closes After Staff Abused,2320,"The idea that state governments can micromanage how businesses reopen in a phased approach is utter insanity. Especially when we already know that we are dealing with a virus that is no more dangerous than the flu. There‚Äôs no need for all of these retarded guidelines. We have clear data on what‚Äôs going on. States should just reopen. This deranged state of affairs allows states to continue these lockdowns indefinitely while falsely claiming that they‚Äôre working to reopen their economies. But all they are doing is psychologically torturing the population with this madness under the guise of protecting public health. This micromanagement is just going to lead to situations like this, where a Massachusetts ice cream shop tried to reopen over Mother‚Äôs Day weekend. Unfortunately, they were forced to institute all these weird state-mandated guidelines which angered customers. The end result was their staff getting verbally abused by customers and one staffer quitting at the end of their shift due to the abuse.

But this behavior was to be expected when the entire population of Massachusetts has been placed under house arrest by the idiot governor for the past few months. And the lockdown in Massachusetts has been much more severe than other states. It‚Äôs impossible to expect businesses to be able to reopen under these strange conditions that have been placed on them. This is all being done to bankrupt small businesses and destroy the middle class. You‚Äôd have to be a fool not to see what‚Äôs going on.

Israeli Prime Minister Wants to Microchip Children,1242,"Back in the 2000s, many of us were called conspiracy theorists for talking about government plans to microchip people. Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is just casually proposing this. Jerusalem Post: Cyber experts slammed Prime Minister¬†Benjamin Netanyahu¬†for his proposal to ‚Äúmicrochip‚Äù children who return to schools and kindergartens as the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, Ynet reported on Friday. While speaking at a press conference on Monday, Netanyahu suggested the Health Ministry use new technology to help Israel adjust to its new routine as the state is lifting the coronavirus lockdown. ‚ÄúThat is, technology that has not been used before and is allowed under the legislation we shall enact,‚Äù he clarified. ‚ÄúI spoke with our heads of technology in order to find measures Israel is good at, such as sensors. For instance, every person, every kid ‚Äì I want it on kids first ‚Äì would have a sensor that would sound an alarm when you get too close, like the ones on cars,‚Äù the prime minister said.

Especially when people like Fauci have basically been saying that we need to keep these idiotic lockdowns in place indefinitely. These lockdown orders were originally put into place to prevent the hospital system from being flooded. They were never meant to stop the spread of the coronavirus because anybody with common sense knew that this was not practical. But yet, that‚Äôs the new narrative that‚Äôs being pushed to keep the lockdowns in place. That‚Äôs also mixed in with this nonsense about how we need to test millions of healthy people for no explainable reason before lifting the restrictions. This is just more proof that these lockdown measures are stupid and should be removed immediately. The fact that Fauci and crew have been exposed and quarantined shows how futile all this is. Clearly, the economy has been destroyed for no legitimate reason and it is being used as a political weapon by Democrats to destroy the orange man‚Äôs chances of a second term. It‚Äôs also being used to create a whole new dystopic society that‚Äôs based largely around the fear of viruses and germs."
Roy of Siegried and Roy Allegedly Dead From Coronavirus,1356,"Roy Horn of the homosexual tiger duo Siegfried and Roy is allegedly dead because of the coronavirus. The Jewish media is making it a point to say that this is what he died from.

After the attack, he was mostly just a walking vegetable who had all sorts of health issues. So what we have here is a situation where he would have died regardless of if he had the coronavirus or not. But the media is saying that he directly died from it to continue hyping up all the virus fear and to justify these continued lockdown measures. This is one of the reasons why we keep seeing these high death numbers. They are literally inflating the numbers by claiming people who died with the coronavirus are the same as people who died from it. Not only that, but hospitals have been given guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where they don‚Äôt even have to test a patient for coronavirus to say that a person died from it. All of this has vastly exaggerated the situation and led to the insanity we are living through."

3.1 Million More Unemployment Claims Filed Last Week,2119,"As expected, unemployment filings are continuing to flood into the system. Another 3.1 million unemployment claims were filed this past week bringing the total to 33.5 million since these deranged lockdowns were implemented. CNBC: Unemployment rolls continued to swell in the U.S. last week, though jobless claims hit their lowest level since the economy went into lockdown made to battle the coronavirus pandemic. First-time filings for unemployment insurance hit 3.17 million last week, bringing the total to 33.5 million over the past seven weeks, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The total was slightly higher than the 3.05 million expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones and below the previous week‚Äôs 3.846 million, which was revised up by 7,000. Though the numbers remain stark, it was the lowest total since the second week of March, shortly after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus strain a pandemic. 3.2 million more people filed for unemployment this week. That makes over 33 million people losing their jobs in the past several weeks. We have voluntarily created the Great Depression. This is truly unprecedented in world economic history. It‚Äôs past time to go back to work. ‚Äî Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) May 7, 2020 I agree with Clay. Everything needs to immediately reopen. The original reason for the lockdowns was to ensure that the hospital system wasn‚Äôt going to get overwhelmed. We knew the system wasn‚Äôt being overwhelmed around mid to late March. The lockdowns should have been immediately lifted at that time. Especially after people were sharing video of empty hospitals everywhere. But instead, they‚Äôve moved the goalposts claiming we need to keep the lockdown to stop the spread of the virus which was not the original purpose of the lockdowns nor the goal. So now you have a situation where these stupid lockdowns have been redirected into a deliberate attempt to financially destroy and ruin America‚Äôs middle class under the guise of ‚Äúpublic health.‚Äù Well, I can say with great certainty that ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù won‚Äôt be good if you have half the country unemployed."
CBS News Exposed Faking Staged Coronavirus Test Line,2088,"Project Veritas just exposed CBS News faking a news story with Cherry Health a Michigan medical facility. They staged a scene where fake patients were filmed going through a coronavirus test line. The intent behind this was obviously meant to make people believe that the coronavirus testing lines are busier than they actually are. Because the reality of the situation is that hardly anybody is getting tested because few people are sick enough to the point where they feel the need to get a test. CBS News as part of the Jew-run media apparatus is heavily invested in making people believe in this retarded pandemic hoax. The response from CBS News and Cherry Health was basically them beating around the bush and blaming each other for the staged event. Although, CBS News did take down their staged propaganda as the footage provided by the whistleblower was far too damning to dismiss. UPDATE: @Project_Veritas has received conflicting statements about the FAKE #COVID19 testing line from both @CherryHealthMI and @CBSNews #ExposeCBS pic.twitter.com/9z01mhrm8b ‚Äî James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) May 6, 2020 This is just another story showing how fake and retarded this whole pandemic hoax is. If this was as bad as we are being told, there would be no need to stage fake testing lines. It‚Äôs also worth noting that roughly a month ago, CBS News was caught using hospital footage from Italy on a news report detailing conditions at New York hospitals. Wow. @CBSNews used footage from the coronavirus crisis at a hospital in Italy for a news report on conditions at New York hospitals as if it was a NY hospital. Everyone involved should be fired. https://t.co/EYMxHagVCV ‚Äî Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) March 30, 2020 CBS News should have its broadcasting license suspended for manufacturing fake news. Of course, the orange man isn‚Äôt going to do shit about the situation other than maybe post an angry tweet about it. God forbid that he demands the FCC do something substantive against this evil Jewish propaganda operation which is literally creating fake news and lying to people."
Newsom Says No Returning to Normal Until We Get Vaccine,1354,"Hey you stupid goyim, there won‚Äôt be any returning to normal until you inject yourself with a 666 Satan vaccine created by Bill Gates and the World Health Organization. That‚Äôs basically what California Governor Gavin Newsom is saying. SF Chronicle: California Gov. Gavin Newsom said as many counties around the state prepare to reopen retail for curbside pickup Friday, maintaining physical-distancing measures will be crucial to reduce the risk of coronavirus spread. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going back to normal,‚Äù said Newsom, who gave Tuesday‚Äôs press briefing from the site of a Sacramento business called Display California. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new normal with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine.‚Äù Newsom first announced yesterday that some retail sectors (including bookstores, clothing shops, sporting goods stores and flower shops) can resume business as long as their local officials give approval and they make changes in their operations, such as having workers wear masks. The governor will detail the new guidelines and requirements later this week. Well guess what Newsom, you can take the Bill Gates hell vaccine and inject it straight up your ass. Seriously, go fuck yourself nigger. This Jewish pandemic hoax is not going to stop us from returning to the way things were. Go ahead and try to stop us and see how far it gets you."
Grocery Store Violates Civil Rights of Man Wearing White Hood,2470,"A man simply exercising his right to free speech had those rights violated when evil grocery store workers demanded he take off a hood. The man was wearing the hood to protect himself from the coronavirus and they did not like his hood choice. NY Post: A day after San Diego residents were required to wear face coverings in public, a man went grocery shopping while wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood, according to a report. The hooded creep was seen roaming the aisles of a Von supermarket in the San Diego County city of Santee on Saturday, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Store clerks repeatedly asked the man to remove the hood or leave the premises. A supervisor approached him at the checkout line and asked him again to take off the hood or leave, company spokeswoman Melissa Hill told the newspaper. The man finally removed the hood, bought his items and left. ‚ÄúAt Vons, fostering an environment of courtesy, dignity and respect is one of our highest priorities, and we work hard to hold everyone in our stores to these standards, including customers,‚Äù Hill said. ‚ÄúSan Diego is #NoPlaceForHate,‚Äù Tammy Gillies, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in San Diego, said on Twitter. Santee Mayor John Minto and residents said on social media that the man‚Äôs actions did not represent the values of the city of almost 60,000 residents. ‚ÄúMany thanks to all who stepped forward to curtail this sad reminder of intolerance,‚Äù Minto said. ‚ÄúSantee, its leaders and I will not tolerate such behavior.‚Äù I find this whole episode to be disgusting. First off, the grocery store mandated the use of a mask which he complied with by wearing the white hood. Second, by asking the man to take off his hood, they violated their own policy that mandated people wear masks. Third, their policy does not mandate what type of mask is required to enter their store. Fourth, asking someone to take off their face covering simply because they dislike the type of face covering they are wearing is discrimination and against the law. Fifth, asking someone to remove their face covering as we are in the middle of the worst pandemic in the history of the world is a health hazard. They put other customers at risk by demanding this man take off his hood. This man should sue this free speech hating grocery store for violating his fundamental civil and human rights. They also put him at risk of being infected with the coronavirus by demanding he take off his protective covering."
Media Falsely Claims Michigan‚Äôs Covid-19 Death Rate is 9 Percent!,3743,"The media‚Äôs reporting on the coronavirus has been criminally irresponsible. They are purposefully scaring people into thinking the death rate of the infection is enormously higher than it is. They aren‚Äôt stopping with these lies either. This recent local media report out of Michigan is claiming that the coronavirus death rate is over 9 percent in Michigan and that the nationwide death rate is over 5 percent! WWMT: Michigan health officials reported 3,866 deaths from COVID-19 making the state‚Äôs death toll is third-highest in the nation, behind only New York and New Jersey. However, Michigan has the country‚Äôs highest death rate. More than 9% of people who‚Äôve tested positive for COVID-19 in Michigan have died, which is almost a full percentage point higher than the next closest state, Connecticut, where more than 8% of people who‚Äôve tested positive have died. Every other state has a death rate lower than 7%. Nationwide the death rate is 5.8%. They are calculating these phony statistics based on just the people who have tested positive for the virus. So they are dividing the deaths with only the people who got tested. The thing is, these statistics only take into account the people who felt sick enough to even bother getting tested. This is not how the death rate of other infections like the flu are calculated which rely on random testing to get a true death rate. This chart they published is total bullshit. The World Health Organization has pushed the same nonsense to give people the perception that the coronavirus is much more dangerous than the flu. Even though they use two entirely different statistical calculations to come up with these numbers. WHO: Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care. Random testing has shown that there are lots of people who have caught the coronavirus but showed no symptoms or weren‚Äôt sick enough to bother getting tested. The virus as it turns out is far more infectious than originally thought and thus far less deadly. These statistics don‚Äôt take that into account and provides a vastly skewed perception of the actual death rate. When similar random testing has been done for the coronavirus, the death rate has been much closer to that of the flu. Take for example this study out of Pennsylvania. Somehow the media missed this: Tonight Dr. Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medicine at @upmc, which offers care across western PA and has 40 hospitals and 87,000 employees ‚Äì predicted a death rate of 0.25% for #COVID. UPMC is reopening elective surgeries.https://t.co/rZcIPL9chu ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) May 1, 2020 And then you have the coronavirus study of Los Angeles County residents done by two doctors. Their study indicated that there was a 0.03 percent death rate in California for the coronavirus. Their press conference revealing their findings has been censored by YouTube which Tucker Carlson covered in great detail. Unfortunately, lots of people don‚Äôt dig into any of the data and just believe these fake charts and graphs being promoted by the media. I truly believe that the people who maliciously promoted these lies should be charged with high crimes and put to death. The amount of damage they have caused is incalculable."
France Extends Virus Emergency to July 24th,1707,"This pandemic hoax is being used to justify totalitarianism in countries around the world. France just extended their virus emergency for another two months. AFP: The French government said on Saturday it will extend a health emergency imposed to fight the new coronavirus by two months, allowing it to keep stringent anti-virus measures in place even after a partial lifting of the country‚Äôs lockdown. Once approved by lawmakers, the emergency period will last until July 24, Health Minister Olivier Veran told a news conference. The government has announced the gradual lifting of some lockdown measures from May 11, including the re-opening of primary schools. Veran said, however, that to lift the health emergency, which began on March 24, at the same time would be premature and carry the risk of a resurgence of the outbreak. ‚ÄúWe are going to have to perform a long-distance run,‚Äù Veran said, adding he was aware that the French people had already been asked for ‚Äúcolossal efforts‚Äù in the fight against the virus. As part of the planned measures, Veran said anybody entering France will have to remain confined for two weeks. This would typically concern ‚ÄúFrench people who travelled abroad and who want to come home‚Äù, he said. Anyone arriving from abroad and infected with the virus would be obliged by law to be quarantined. It is safe to assume that when July 24th rolls around, the government will extend the order again. Of course by then we‚Äôll probably see all sorts of riots, civil unrest, starvation and who knows what else throughout the country. The economic devastation that this lockdown is causing is going to be incalculable and the longer the lockdown continues, the worse it will get."
NJ Governor Begs Trump for Cash After Destroying State‚Äôs Economy,2184,"The freedom-hating lunatic Phil Murphy who is the current governor of New Jersey, was at the White House yesterday begging the orange man for money. This after he maliciously closed the state‚Äôs economy and ordered everyone locked in their homes because of this dumb virus hoax. President @realDonaldTrump just met with @GovMurphy on Coronavirus testing, financial assistance, and planning a great comeback for New Jersey. ‚ÄúI thank you for the enormous help in our darkest hour of need,"" Gov.

Phil Murphy on Thursday pleaded with President Donald Trump for billions of dollars in federal aid for states and cities, making the case during a personal meeting at the White House. ‚ÄúWe need a significant amount. This is a big hit,‚Äù Murphy, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, told Trump during the morning meeting in the Oval Office. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see this as a bailout, we see this as a partnership ‚Äî doing the right thing in what is the worst health care crisis in the history of our nation.‚Äù He says it would be a ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù and not a ‚Äúbailout.‚Äù Nice word choice pal. But seriously Phil, maybe you should have thought about your state‚Äôs financial situation before you decided to close everything down because you were afraid of some germs. If you haven‚Äôt already, be sure to watch Tucker Carlson‚Äôs interview with this moron. He literally admitted that he gave no thought to the Bill of Rights when he made the decision to close the state. He also made other baffling statements like saying that keeping liquor stores open was essential for mental health even though he ordered churches closed. This man is a retard and an idiot of the highest order and I believe that there is at least a 55 percent chance that he fucks children. Trump should let all of these states run by Democrat governors go into financial collapse. He should let fools like Murphy deal with the political consequences of their own actions."
Fraud Fauci Claims Second Infection Wave is ‚ÄúInevitable‚Äù,1512,"The fraud Fauci is claiming that a second infection wave is ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù Washington Post: As antsy Americans show growing signs of ‚Äúquarantine fatigue‚Äù and officials face pressure to ease coronavirus restrictions, factories, malls and state governments in many parts of the country are taking steps toward reopening. But Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a second wave of infections is ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù in the United States, which has recorded more than 1 million confirmed cases ‚Äî nearly one-third of the global total. Fauci also warned that ‚Äúwe could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter‚Äù if the right countermeasures aren‚Äôt put in place. This lying old worm has been wrong about the coronavirus the entire time, yet he‚Äôs still being given a platform to scare the shit out of people. We already know that this infection is no more dangerous than the flu and he refuses to tell people the truth. Fauci‚Äôs prediction is worth about as much as a shit that comes out of a bull‚Äôs ass. Not only is he talking about an ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù second wave over the summer, but he‚Äôs saying that if we don‚Äôt continue this stupid lockdown shit that we‚Äôll have a bad fall and a bad winter. He‚Äôs going to keep saying these scary things until Bill Gates, Israel, big pharma or the World Health Organization comes up with some satanic 666 vaccine that they will demand everybody get injected with. I hope this lying piece of shit drops dead and he spends all of eternity in hell."
Trump Says China and the WHO Hid Data on Deadly Virus,2787,"Donald Trump is claiming that the coronavirus is a plot by China and the World Health Organization because they hid information on the deadly nature of the virus. So as a result, he has ordered an investigation into the situation. NBC News: The White House has ordered intelligence agencies to comb through communications intercepts, human source reporting, satellite imagery and other data to establish whether China and the World Health Organization initially hid what they knew about the emerging¬†coronavirus pandemic, current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter told NBC News. A specific ‚Äútasking‚Äù seeking information about the outbreak‚Äôs early days was sent last week to the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which includes the¬†National Center for Medical Intelligence, an official directly familiar with the matter said. The CIA has received similar instructions, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. President Donald Trump appeared to refer to the request at his news conference Monday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing very serious investigations,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe are not happy with that whole situation, because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn‚Äôt have spread all over the world.‚Äù As part of the tasking, intelligence agencies were asked to determine what the WHO knew about two research labs studying coronaviruses in the Chinese province of Wuhan, where the virus was first observed. NBC News has previously reported that the spy agencies have been investigating the possibility that the virus escaped accidentally from one of the labs, although many experts believe that is unlikely. This is so dumb. Who exactly does this resonate with outside of the small handful of lunatic neocons that appear on Jewish television networks? I‚Äôm no fan of China but China did not order states to close down the economy over a virus that has proven to be no more dangerous than the flu. Our own politicians did that. This move is more about building a case to justify a big war with China than it is anything else. The World Health Organization should be blamed but not for colluding with China or hiding data on the supposedly dangerous nature of the virus. They should be blamed for trying to prolong the lockdowns and for advocating the destruction of our economy over an obvious hoax. All this is doing is feeding into the hoax narrative that this virus is the doomsday plague. Trump should be fully aligning with the people who are lashing out at the state governors for keeping their economies locked down. The Jewish media which fed all of this hysteria about the virus could also be blamed. But instead we get this bullshit gibberish about China and the WHO."
"California Doctors Say Coronavirus Like the Flu, Question Lockdown",5515,"Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi a couple of California doctors who have been closely involved with coronavirus testing did a press conference last week detailing their findings and experiences with the coronavirus. Everything they said at their press conference is exactly what I‚Äôve been saying about this for the past six weeks. That the coronavirus is no more deadly than the flu and that these lockdown measures are pointless, stupid and insane. Anglin has already published an article over the Daily Stormer summarizing the main points they made at their press conference. They read like a summary of the things that have been said on both the Daily Stormer and on this blog in the numerous coronavirus articles that we‚Äôve published. We have never quarantined the healthy, the basic concept makes no sense. We are supposed to quarantine the sick. We should follow the actual scientific data, rather than saying we‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing science‚Äù and just making up absurd claims. Based on actual scientific data, in the state of California, you have a 0.03% chance of dying from COVID-19. 9% of those diagnosed with the virus recover. Millions of cases, small amount of death. Sweden and Norway, two countries that are right next to each other where one locked down and the other didn‚Äôt, did not experience vastly different results. This proves that this lockdown is not necessary. The lockdown is increasing the rate of child molestation and spousal abuse. Also, anxiety, depression, suicide. We‚Äôre having an economic collapse. The medical industry is going to be hit very hard economically. This virus is not different from the flu. There was a 0.13 chance of death from the flu in 2017. COVID-19 is lower than that. Everything about the virus is similar to the flu, if you actually look at the scientific data. The immune system develops by being exposed to pathogens. This weird attempt to avoid the virus is harming the natural development of the immune system. It is basic microbiology, immunology and common sense that you need exposure to germs to survive. Disease is going to spike when people reenter society. The lockdown doesn‚Äôt actually protect anyone, because they‚Äôre buying products from stores. It makes no sense that people are allowed to go to the grocery and not church. The virus is still being transferred widely, as the data demonstrates. These idiot plastic gloves people are wearing are helping the virus spread. It‚Äôs just the flu, bro. A bunch of deaths are being attributed to the virus that are not caused by the virus. Doctors are being pressured to add ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù to death reports. We‚Äôre going to have minimal hospital staff and significant disease whenever the lockdown ends. Dr. Erickson has talked to the majority of health officials in the state, and all agree the lockdown should be lifted. How does it make sense you can go shopping in a big corporate store and all small businesses are closed? This is not science in any way whatsoever. This should be treated like the flu. People with symptoms and people with high risk should stay home, everyone else should be allowed to live their lives normally. Going outside is healthy. No one at Home Depot is wearing a mask and you can go there. But you can‚Äôt go to the park and walk around alone. With the economy collapsed, homelessness is going to shoot up and millions of people‚Äôs lives are going to be ruined. We have to be more responsible. This is just like the flu. The flu has been killing people for 100 years. We‚Äôre not afraid of the flu because we‚Äôre familiar with it. We should be following DATA not these models. They agree with the initial response, because the nature of the virus wasn‚Äôt known. But now we know. 90% of people who die die with co-morbidity (other contributing factors). The news has a skewed view because they are still working and getting paid. The government doesn‚Äôt have a right to decide what is ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù When they say ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù they mean ‚Äúcontrol.‚Äù This is all going to end in violence. Even though these doctors are literal frontline experts and co-owners of a private clinic that are conducting actual coronavirus these tests, there has been a deliberate attempt to censor their findings. They are doing this because their findings and expert opinions do not correlate with the official mainstream position of people like Bill Gates and the World Health Organization. The original YouTube video of this press conference received roughly five million views before it was deleted off the site due to alleged terms of service violations. Jewish YouTube has actually been going so far as to delete alternative copies the video of off of their site. The evil Jewess Susan Wojcicki who runs YouTube, previously did a CNN interview saying that videos containing material disagreeing with the official positions of the World Health Organization would be deleted. Tucker Carlson did a whole segment last night exposing how absurd this censorship is. So much for data and science. These are actual experts on the frontlines conducting coronavirus tests. We keep hearing about how important science is. Well if science was really that important, there wouldn‚Äôt be this agenda to delete a video of frontline doctors sharing their expertise and findings with the public. There is nothing scientific about censoring doctors sharing their data and findings. And what happened to medical personnel being superheroes and gods who can‚Äôt be questioned? I guess that only applies if you are a supporter of this retarded pandemic hoax."
CLAIM: 20 Million Virus Tests a Day to Reopen Country,2677,"The new excuse being provided as to why we can‚Äôt immediately reopen the country‚Äôs economy is that we don‚Äôt have enough coronavirus testing capacity. A new study is actually claiming that we can‚Äôt safely reopen the country unless 20 million coronavirus tests per day are conducted! Yahoo: According to a Harvard study, the United States needs to be conducting 20 million tests per day to reopen the country completely. Right now, the country is conducting about 250,000 tests a day, after several weeks during which testing remained at a frustratingly steady 150,000 per day. That means testing has to be increased by 80 times in order to meet the standard determined by the Harvard researchers. This is complete fucking bullshit. 20 million tests a day? For what purpose would you need to conduct so many tests? This is sort of like when Andrew ‚ÄúNipples‚Äù Cuomo said he needed 30,000 ventilators when he didn‚Äôt need a fraction of that amount. The bottom line is that you do not need to conduct that many tests in order to determine how widespread the coronavirus is. There‚Äôs no logical reason for such a large sample size nor the need to have such a broad testing capacity. I‚Äôm not even sure how it would be feasible to get to such a point where 20 million daily tests could be conducted. That‚Äôs roughly seven percent of the country‚Äôs whole population. It‚Äôs already been determined from previous test studies, that the death rate of the coronavirus is not that much different than the flu. Some have argued that it is just a variation of the flu. Plus, we have empty hospitals everywhere around the country so there are few people getting sick to the point where they require hospitalization from this. Wasn‚Äôt that the original reason for the lockdown? That there were concerns of the hospital system being overwhelmed? Well, that didn‚Äôt happen, so now they‚Äôre just moving the goalposts on why we need to continue this retarded lockdown. Conducting 20 million tests a day would obviously be a waste of time and resources. All you‚Äôd be doing is testing millions of healthy people. There‚Äôd also be no intrinsic scientific value in doing this. This is clearly just some bullshit study designed to promote propaganda that justifies a continuation of these lockdowns. Bill Gates says America's ability to safely and effectively lift coronavirus restrictions will depend on its capacity to aggressively test for and trace new cases of the virus. https://t.co/s16F8TaQAm ‚Äî CNN (@CNN) April 27, 2020 They want to keep everybody under some state of lockdown until they develop some weird satanic mystery vaccine that they‚Äôll forcibly inject you with. The agenda couldn‚Äôt be more obvious."
CNN Says Reopening State Economies Will Cause Mass Death,1182,"We have new coronavirus projection models from the government and CNN is saying that we need to believe these new projection models. CNN is also saying that the new models indicate that mass death will occur if we reopen state economies. Just look at this hysterical headline they published. Of course every single previous projection model that was produced by the government to justify this insane lockdown has been proven wrong. But CNN wants us to believe that this new government projection is somehow not wrong. It‚Äôs lunacy, but not unexpected from a lying Jewish propaganda network like CNN. There is simply no reason to believe any government models or projections based on their sorry track record. On top of that, the government has issued guidance to bolster the alleged amounts of coronavirus deaths in order to make people think the coronavirus is more deadly than it actually is. But all the statistical data indicates that it is no more dangerous than the flu. There is no reason why a full reopening of the economy can‚Äôt occur. This is just lunatic doomsday bullshit being pushed by CNN in conjunction with lying statistical manipulators who work for the government."
NYC ER Doctor Survives Coronavirus Commits Suicide Over Lockdown,3046,"There is this very weird push by the media to present medical personnel as superheroes and demigods. This is all an attempt to bolster this retarded pandemic hoax. Hence why they are highlighting stories like the suicide of this woman who headed the emergency department of a New York City hospital. They‚Äôre presenting her like she was some type of war casualty who died on the front lines of battle. NY Post: The head of the emergency department at a Manhattan hospital committed suicide after spending days on the front lines of the coronavirus battle, her family said Monday. ‚ÄúShe tried to do her job, and it killed her,‚Äô‚Äô Dr. Philip Breen told the New York Times of his physician daughter, Dr. Lorna Breen, who had been medical director of the NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital amid the pandemic. The battle-weary ER doctor, 49, was only the latest city health care worker to take her own life. Two days earlier, a Bronx EMT witnessing the virus‚Äô ruthless toll fatally shot himself with a gun belonging to his retired NYPD cop dad. Tragic rookie paramedic John Mondello, 23, worked out of EMS Station 18 in The Bronx, which handles one of the biggest 911 call volumes in the city. Lorna died Sunday in Charlottesville, Virginia, where she‚Äôd been staying with her family, her father told the Times. Philip Breen said his daughter had gotten sick with the virus while on the job at one point, but then returned to work after about a week and a half of recuperating. Still, the hospital sent her home again, and her family brought her to Virginia. She had no history of mental illness, he said. But when they last spoke, she told him how excruciating it was to have to continually watch contagion patients die, including some even before they could be taken from the ambulance. ‚ÄúShe was truly in the trenches on the front line,‚Äô‚Äô Philip Breen told the Times. ‚ÄúMake sure she‚Äôs praised as a hero,‚Äô‚Äô he added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a casualty just as much as anyone else who has died.‚Äô‚Äô Reached later by The Post, Philip Breen, his voice cracking, said he was too distraught to talk further. The media obviously won‚Äôt tell you this, but her suicide was a direct result of the lunatic lockdown and all of the media hysteria surrounding the coronavirus. A few years ago, we had a flu season that killed more people than the coronavirus, and this woman who we can assume was working in a similar capacity at that time, did not kill herself when all of that happened. The X-factor is the lockdown and the subsequent lies pushed by the media. It is driving people over the edge and pushing some to suicide. But if nurses and medical staff commit suicide or die as all this is going on, the media is going to present them as heroic figures. Literal gods who can‚Äôt be questioned. It‚Äôs a big part of the reason why you see people in nurse outfits counter-protesting the working people who are demanding the economy reopened. They want people to think the protesters are evil people who hate heroic nurses who are risking their lives in the middle of this fake pandemic."
Tyson Foods Warns That the Food Supply Chain is Breaking,2601,"Tyson Foods purchased full page advertisements in The New York Times and other newspapers describing how there are some major problems with the food supply chain. Tyson Foods didn‚Äôt mince words in a full page @nytimes ad Sunday, warning, ‚Äúthe food supply chain is breaking.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close‚Ä¶millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,‚Äù John Tyson wrote. pic.twitter.com/0jJxrMOngw ‚Äî Mosheh Oinounou (@Mosheh) April 27, 2020 I‚Äôm certainly no fan of these large food processing companies, but there are many legitimate concerns surrounding the food supply that were directly caused by this lunatic lockdown situation. Any attention being shed on this problem is good even if it comes from a company like Tyson Foods. But instead of people agreeing that there is a major problem, people are spending their time bashing the messenger and whining about how Tyson Foods is an evil corporation that does bad things. They‚Äôve even been accused of promoting irrational fear when there are a wide variety of documented problems with the food supply. This isn‚Äôt some hoax like the coronavirus pandemic. There are also groups like PETA who are using this opportunity to promote veganism. The only thing at risk is Tyson Foods' bottom line, as the #vegan food supply is plentiful and will not only save animals, but will also likely save humans from heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, and all the other killer diseases related to eating meat. ‚Äî PETA (@peta) April 27, 2020 At this point, I do not give a shit if Tyson Foods is an evil company or not. They are raising a valid concern. We have farmers destroying crops and food processing plants closed which is obviously going to cause a problem with keeping people fed. I want to talk about how this problem can be solved. Right now, there aren‚Äôt very many people who are proposing solutions. A good start would be to reopen the economy and arrest people who have been scaring people into thinking that the coronavirus is some doomsday plague. It is not a doomsday plague and the people who keep pushing this narrative are criminals who should be arrested. They are scaring people into thinking that it is not safe to work at these plants and that they could die. This despite the death rate of the coronavirus being no worse than the flu and the people who have allegedly died from it are mostly old people and people with preexisting conditions. But whatever, I guess maybe we can all become vegans. Problem solved right? I mean, this guy is a vegan and he looks very healthy. ¬†"
Crazy Scarf Lady Says Social Distancing Will Last Through Summer,1815,"Dr. Deborah Birx otherwise known as the crazy scarf lady, was on Meet the Press this weekend telling the country that social distancing protocols will need to remain in place through the summer. What I‚Äôd like to know is why anybody is still listening to this stupid old hag. It‚Äôs absurd that she is still looked at as some sort of expert authority figure. She was wrong about millions of people dying from this alleged virus plague and played a prominent role in pushing for this insane lockdown of society that has caused untold economic devastation. You would think she would resign her office in shame, but she‚Äôs a woman, so she will not admit responsibility for her role in collapsing the economy. And what is the exact science behind this weird concept of having people stand six feet apart from one another? Has anybody even tried to explain it? Stores and other places of business are just mindlessly following this bizarre concept and posting all these strange social distancing signs everywhere. When we finally get into the summer months, we can pretty much expect her or somebody else in government to come up with some new excuse as to why we have to continue this retarded practice indefinitely. But I wish them luck in trying to maintain such stupid social protocols. By this summer, we are going to be in the middle of a brutal economic collapse. There will be drug addicts and homeless people everywhere. Not to mention severe food and supply shortages. There will be far more pressing issues threatening our health and safety than some alleged virus plague that has proven to be no more deadly than the flu. We are literally entering the gates of hell and we have this stupid old woman lecturing us about standing six feet apart from one another. It‚Äôs honestly difficult to comprehend this madness."
White House: Unemployment is At Least 16 Percent,1855,"We are facing an unemployment crisis that will be far worse than the Great Depression. This is just the reality that we are facing. Reuters: The economic fallout from the unprecedented social distancing requirements has been devastating. Business shutdowns have led to a record 26.5 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted on Friday that the economy would contract at an annual rate of nearly a 40% in the second quarter. Even next year, the CBO forecast calls for an unemployment rate averaging above 10%. Before the pandemic struck, the U.S. jobless rate was hovering at a 50-year low of 3.5%. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters on Sunday the jobless rate would likely hit 16% or more in April. ‚ÄúI think the next couple of months are going to look terrible,‚Äù Hassett said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see numbers as bad as anything we‚Äôve ever seen before.‚Äù If a White House economic adviser is admitting that unemployment is at least 16 percent, you know things are bad. I personally believe that the true unemployment rate will rise to somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent. And I think that this is a very conservative estimate. What will probably happen is that they will manipulate the unemployment numbers in such a way to make people think things aren‚Äôt as bad as they are. So whatever the official unemployment numbers are, just assume that the actual numbers are much worse than the reported numbers. We are literally sleepwalking into the biggest economic disaster the world has ever seen. Meanwhile, media pundits and politicians are claiming that we are all in danger of dying from a virus that has proven to be no more deadly than the flu. The criminal irresponsibility of what has been done here is difficult to comprehend. God help us all."
Trump Blamed for Increase in People Ingesting Household Cleaners,2176,"So now Donald Trump is at fault because New Yorkers stupidly decided to ingest household cleaners. NY Daily News: An unusually high number of New Yorkers contacted city health authorities over fears that they had ingested bleach or other household cleaners in the 18 hours that followed President Trump‚Äôs bogus claim that injecting such products could cure coronavirus, the Daily News has learned. The Poison Control Center, a subagency of the city‚Äôs Health Department, managed a total of 30 cases of possible exposure to disinfectants between 9 p.m. Thursday and 3 p.m. Friday, a spokesman said. None of the people who reached out died or required hospitalization, the spokesman said. But compared to last year, the number of cases was worthy of a double-take. It‚Äôs also apparently his fault that the same thing happened in Maryland and Michigan. Maryland and Michigan experience surge in poison control calls after Trump's disinfectant comments https://t.co/R9R4vTTAiR pic.twitter.com/mwBq8B1jTF ‚Äî The Hill (@thehill) April 26, 2020 This is not Trump‚Äôs fault. This is the fault of the Jewish media misquoting him and irresponsibly taking his statements out of context. He was mostly thinking out loud when he made the statement about disinfectants. The kike-run media and the usual blue checkmark losers on Twitter are the ones who introduced this idea that this was the equivalent of him recommending Lysol or drinking bleach as a coronavirus cure. It‚Äôs also a product of the Jewish media focusing so much attention on it. I wrote a satire piece mocking their focus on this yesterday. CNN‚Äôs Anderson Cooper a gay cocksucker who worked for the CIA, dedicated a ten minute segment to this bullshit on his fake news program the other day. Cooper literally played clips of what Trump said and then claimed he said something completely different to advance their anti-Trump narrative. What CNN is doing is not news. This is political propaganda being used to attack the president who CNN and other Jewish media operations dislike. The fact that they have pushed this disinfectant angle so hard is why a small handful of retards went nuts and decided to drink bleach or whatever."
1/3rd of Death Certificates Were Wrong Before Coronavirus,1874,"How can we trust any of the coronavirus death numbers being reported by the government when there are stories like this? USA Today: As the United States¬†struggles to track coronavirus fatalities amid spotty testing, delayed lab results and inconsistent reporting standards, a more insidious problem could thwart the country‚Äôs quest for an accurate death toll. Up to 1 in 3 death certificates nationwide were wrong before COVID-19, Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an interview with the USA TODAY Network. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always worried about getting good data. I think this sort of thing can be an issue even in a pandemic,‚Äù Anderson said. Experts said the inaccuracies are part and parcel of a patchwork, state-by-state system of medical examiners, coroners and doctors who have disparate medical backgrounds, and in some cases none at all. The problem is likely to get worse as the pandemic inundates¬†overworked and sometimes untrained officials who fill out the forms.¬† The government is simply not competent. This is the result of affirmative action policies that have allowed women, racial minorities and other unqualified individuals to fill important positions within the bureaucracy. As a result of this, the system has become totally dysfunctional. I mean, how hard is it to fill out a form stating what somebody died from? This is a simple task and not one that would result in 1/3rd of deaths being misidentified. But leave it to the government to fuck up something so simple. So based on this, there is no reason to trust the official coronavirus death numbers that we are getting. We already know that top level people have pushed policies to inflate the death numbers and when you combine it with this type of gross incompetence, you‚Äôd be foolish to believe that we are getting accurate numbers."
Wisconsin: Thousands Protest Tyrannical Lockdown Order,2374,"A major protest against the state governor‚Äôs tyrannical lockdown order occurred yesterday in Wisconsin. The Hill: Thousands of protesters descended on the Wisconsin State Capitol on Friday as they¬†called for coronavirus restrictions implemented by Gov. Tony Evers (D) to be lifted. Photos of the massive¬†demonstration show protesters packed on the capitol‚Äôs steps, breaking social distancing guidelines as they crammed into the area standing shoulder to shoulder. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that protesters¬†cheered ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù and circulated petitions to recall Evers. Protesters also reportedly held signs reading ‚ÄúAll Workers, Are Essential‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath‚Ä¶. is preferable to communism.‚Äù The original stay-at-home order¬†was supposed to end Friday,¬†but last week, Evers extended it to May 26. Evers‚Äôs new extension of stay-at-home orders does¬†make some adjustments, including the opening of golf courses. As of Friday evening, Wisconsin health officials said there were 5,356 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state and 262 deaths. I‚Äôve been saying for weeks that it would be impossible to maintain these retarded lockdown orders indefinitely. Especially considering how it is becoming increasingly obvious that the coronavirus has not caused a major health crisis. Hospitals are empty and medical workers are being laid off around the country. All the data we are getting shows that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu and that‚Äôs despite weird attempts by government officials to inflate the death numbers. These lockdown orders are nothing more than a deliberate attack against working Americans. The lockdowns threaten people‚Äôs ability to survive and provide for their families. Protests against them are only going to grow in size and frequency the longer they continue. What else is someone who is out of work and can‚Äôt get work because of government imposed restrictions going to do besides protest? These state governments have left these people with no alternative but to protest. All these unconstitutional and illegal lockdowns need to end immediately. The focus needs to shift on to how we are going to manage the severe economic fallout that has resulted from this madness. Of course, the chance of that happening is close to zero. These treasonous politicians and bureaucrats are going to try and extend these lockdowns as long as possible."
WHO Implies Only a Vaccine Will Make You Immune From Coronavirus,2564,"The World Health Organization which has been wrong about the coronavirus every step of the way, is now saying that recovering from the infection doesn‚Äôt mean you have immunity. France 24: The World Health Organization warned on Saturday that recovering from coronavirus may not protect people from reinfection as the death toll from the pandemic approached 200,000 around the globe. Governments across the world are struggling to limit the economic devastation unleashed by the virus, which has infected nearly 2.8 million people and left half of humanity under some form of lockdown. The United Nations has joined world leaders in a push to speed up development of a vaccine, but effective treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, are still far off. But with signs the disease is peaking in the US and Europe, governments are starting to ease restrictions, weighing the need for economic recovery against cautions that lifting them too soon risks a second wave of infections. The WHO warned on Saturday that there is still no evidence that people who test positive for the new coronavirus and recover are immunised and protected against reinfection. It‚Äôs pretty clear why they are saying this. The WHO is a major advocate of mass vaccination programs. They want to use this pandemic hoax to vaccinate as many people as possible with whatever mystery vaccine they promote to the public. If they say that people who recover are immune from the coronavirus, those people won‚Äôt need to get a vaccine. Ultimately, what I think these people are going to push for is to make people take a new coronavirus vaccine every year. They are also going to demand governments make the vaccine mandatory in order for people to work and/or travel. And god only knows what will be in whatever vaccine they come up with. But it will probably be some type of 666 Mark of the Beast shit. The one thing I know is that I will never take any of these retarded coronavirus vaccines. I‚Äôd rather be dead than injected with whatever vaccine they promote. Especially considering that the satanic dickhead Bill Gates who tortured the world with a myriad of terrible computer operating systems seems to be the architect of this weird vaccine agenda. Bill probably wants to inject us with liquid shit mixed with dystopic nanotechnology that will allow him to control your brain via a 5G network connection. Well Bill, I am not going to allow you to control my brain via a 5G network connection. Feel free to test your poop nanotechnology vaccine on some African niggers though."
Georgia Partially Reopens State Economy,2465,"Georgia has gone ahead with a partial reopening of their economy. Reuters: With the U.S. coronavirus death toll topping 51,000 and nearly one in six workers out of a job, Georgia, Oklahoma and several other states took tentative steps at reopening businesses on Friday, despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and medical experts. Fitness clubs, hair salons, tattoo parlors and some other workplaces were allowed to open their doors by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, disregarding warnings from public health officials that easing restrictions too soon could lead to more infections and deaths. The Jewish media has been hysterical about this partial reopening and have been claiming that huge numbers of people are going to die because of this. CNN interviewed some nigger pastor in Atlanta who claimed that reopening the economy was going to cause mass nigger death. An Atlanta pastor says Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp‚Äôs order to permit the opening of hair salons, barbershops and churches ‚Äî important gathering spots to the black community ‚Äî is like leading black people in Georgia ""to the slaughter‚Äù https://t.co/7MpnuQSybk pic.twitter.com/hVkIYUqeOF ‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) April 25, 2020 And then you have this kike on Twitter promoting Jewish propaganda from The New York Times saying that Georgia isn‚Äôt ready to reopen. This is so alarmingly well done: Why Georgia Isn‚Äôt Ready to Reopen, in Charts https://t.co/OQk1Wrhgfh #COVID19 ‚Äî Deborah Blum (@deborahblum) April 24, 2020 There are countless examples of this type of nonsense being pushed in the Jewish media. What‚Äôs probably going to happen next is that they‚Äôre going to find a single case of some baby or child allegedly dying of the coronavirus in the state. They will focus in on this single case and use emotionally charged rhetoric to blame it on the economy reopening. It‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed that they‚Äôre going to do this. It is a popular method they have previously used to justify wars. Take for example the Jewish hoax claiming that Iraqi soldiers were throwing Kuwaiti babies out of incubators. Or how about the more recent Syria baby-gassing hoax? It‚Äôs all so stupid. For anybody who is so afraid of this alleged doomsday virus, there is nothing stopping them from keeping themselves locked inside their homes for all of eternity. To tell other people that they can‚Äôt work or live their lives as they see fit because they are personally afraid of death is the height of absurdity."
Trump Adviser Proposes Putting Everyone in Spacesuits,1615,"Stephen Moore who is one of Donald Trump‚Äôs economic advisers has been talking about putting everyone in a spacesuit to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Week: One of President Trump‚Äôs economic advisers has an admittedly ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù idea for how to reopen the country amid the coronavirus pandemic: space outfits. Stephen Moore, a member of Trump‚Äôs economic task force, spoke to The New York Times this week about restarting the U.S. economy, saying he‚Äôs been advising the president about how ‚Äúwe have to really get things opened‚Äù as soon as May 1st. But how are states to send people back to work in a safe way that doesn‚Äôt endanger public health? Moore offered a bit of an ‚Ä¶ out of the box ‚Ä¶ suggestion. ‚ÄúI was thinking this morning, and this is just kind of a thought experiment because I was thinking about this ‚Äî why don‚Äôt we just put everybody in a space outfit or something like that?‚Äù Moore asked. ‚ÄúNo. Seriously.‚Äù The Times noted to Miller that ‚Äúwell, we‚Äôd have to make the space outfits,‚Äù a fact he acknowledged while continuing to spitball. This is basically just a few steps away from proposing to put everyone in pods with feeding tubes and wires implanted in the back of their heads. I‚Äôm becoming more and more convinced that the vast majority of people on this planet have lost all ability to think rationally about anything. We are seeing all sorts of crazy and bizarre policies being pushed by people in prominent positions that would have been considered lunatic-tier just a few years ago. The world has gone collectively mad. Logic and reason are no longer being applied to anything it seems."
Twitter Blocks 5G Conspiracy Tweets,2376,"Even though I don‚Äôt personally agree with many of the 5G conspiracies that have been promoted, I certainly do not agree with social media sites censoring them. And that‚Äôs exactly what Twitter is doing to 5G conspiracy tweets. AFP: Twitter is taking down comments inciting ‚Äúharmful activity,‚Äù specifically calls to destroy wireless equipment stemming from a conspiracy theory that linked 5G to the coronavirus. ‚ÄúWe have broadened our guidance on unverified claims that incite people to engage in harmful activity, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical 5G infrastructure, or could lead to widespread panic, social unrest, or large-scale disorder,‚Äù the Twitter safety team said on Wednesday. The move follows social media calls that have resulted in attacks on 5G towers in some European countries. Twitter‚Äôs update is the latest in an effort by social media platforms to curb rampant misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. In a blog post, Twitter said it was refining its policy to deal with the latest incidents. It will remove ‚Äúunverified claims‚Äù what could lead to the destruction or damage of critical infrastructure, ‚Äúwidespread panic, social unrest, or large-scale disorder,‚Äù the statement said. These include tweets that falsely tell people food is running out or that 5G wireless causes coronavirus, the San Francisco firm said. You would have thought that these tech companies would be sick of censoring people‚Äôs thoughts by now, but they just keep getting more and more draconian with the thought policing. The fact of the matter is that 5G technology was deployed without a whole lot of vetting from a health perspective. The lack of transparency has resulted in the spread of these conspiracies and it is why people are destroying 5G antennas. Censoring discussion on this topic is only going to fuel more conspiracies and paranoia which will result in more 5G antennas being destroyed. If this was not the outcome they wanted, an open discussion on the matter should be allowed. We need more free speech and less censorship but that‚Äôs not what we are getting from these evil social media companies. Twitter should just say that you aren‚Äôt allowed to post anything on our site that disagrees with the point of views put out on CNN or other Jewish media operations. At least if they did that, they would be honest about their real terms of service."
Coronavirus 50 Times Less Deadly Than Claimed,3570,"A random test of adults in the Los Angeles County area revealed that 4.1 percent of the population already has the coronavirus. This means that the infection rate of the coronavirus is much higher than originally reported and also far less deadly than originally reported. New York Times: On Monday, officials in Los Angeles County¬†released preliminary results¬†of a study that suggest roughly 4.1 percent of the county‚Äôs adult population has already had the coronavirus, which translates to between 221,000 and 442,000 people, factoring in adjustments for statistical margin of error. That‚Äôs a much, much higher number than¬†confirmed case counts indicate. (As of early Tuesday morning, the¬†county had 13,816 cases.) ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt known the true extent of Covid-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited,‚Äù Neeraj Sood, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California and lead investigator on the study, said in a statement. Dr. Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County‚Äôs public health director, said in a statement that the early results pointed to the possibility that many people may have been unknowingly infected. In order to provide some perspective on this, Anglin wrote an article over at the Daily Stormer crunching these numbers in more detail. So far, he seems to be the only person who has bothered to do this. I even went through the process of double checking them because it originally appeared as if the coronavirus might be more deadly than the flu. That has proven not to be the case and these numbers reveal that conclusively. What we are dealing with here is not a doomsday virus but instead an enormous hoax fueled by insane media hysteria. So let‚Äôs review the numbers. The Los Angeles County area has a population of around ten million people. If we apply the results of this study to the entire population it means that 410,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus. Los Angeles County has so far reported around 600 coronavirus deaths which means that the coronavirus death rate is around .0015 or .15%. This is roughly around the same death rate as the flu which is .001 or .1%. When you also factor in the fact that the Centers for Disease Control issued guidance instructing hospitals to inflate the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths, we can safely say that the coronavirus is no more deadly than the flu. But in order to scare the public, we‚Äôve been given statistics comparing coronavirus deaths to just the people who sought treatment. This dishonest statistical calculation doesn‚Äôt factor in the many people who caught it but weren‚Äôt sick enough to seek treatment. It‚Äôs a far different statistical calculation. Random testing has always been used to determine the yearly flu death rate. So the entire methodology used to calculate the coronavirus death rate has been intentionally flawed and designed to promote doom virus propaganda. It has resulted in totally dishonest chart comparisons like this. Roughly speaking, the coronavirus is 50 times more infectious than is being claimed, meaning it is 50 times less deadly than is being claimed. Suffice to say, this whole thing is a gigantic hoax. You‚Äôve been lied to. That‚Äôs all you need to know. It‚Äôs time to hold the media and politicians accountable for promoting this hoax. Just think of how many people‚Äôs lives have been ruined and futures destroyed as a result of this. And to top it all off, they‚Äôre using this crisis to implement all sorts of weird dystopic and satanic agendas."
California Bans Protests on State Grounds,1712,"If this happened in China or Russia, the Jewish media would be crying about freedom of speech and human rights. But instead, the Jewish media is supporting these authoritarian crackdowns on free speech, free movement and free assembly. Sacramento Bee: Following Monday‚Äôs protest at the state Capitol where demonstrators defied Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs orders banning large gatherings, the California Highway Patrol says it will no longer issue permits for events at any state properties, including the Capitol. ‚ÄúPermits are issued to provide safe environments for demonstrators to express their views,‚Äù the CHP said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn this case, the permit for the convoy was issued with the understanding that the protest would be conducted in a manner consistent with the state‚Äôs public health guidance. ‚ÄúThat is not what occurred, and CHP will take this experience into account when considering permits for this or any other group.‚Äù Monday‚Äôs protest, which mirrored others that have sprung up nationwide and have been dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Gridlock,‚Äù featured hundreds of people driving vehicles around the Capitol complex in downtown Sacramento honking horns and hundreds of others standing shoulder to shoulder cheering them on as they expressed opposition to the governor‚Äôs stay-at-home order. So because the government has claimed that there is an alleged doomsday virus, your right to assemble has been suspended. This is unconstitutional and illegal but nobody seems to give a shit about that. Too many people have bought into the doomsday virus narrative even though the narrative is not backed up by any of the data. Ultimately, none of this is going to matter soon. The entire system is collapsing before us."
Virus Hysteria Could End Colleges and Universities,3896,"The American college and university system could very well collapse as a result of all this virus hysteria. This is a possibility that is now being openly discussed in the mainstream. NPR: Most campuses in the United States are sitting empty. Courses are online, students are at home. And administrators are trying to figure out how to make the finances of that work. ‚ÄúThe math is not pretty,‚Äù says Robert Kelchen, who studies higher ed finance at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. ‚ÄúColleges are stressed both on the revenue side and on the expenditure side.‚Äù On one end of the equation, colleges are spending money to take classes online, in some situations purchasing software, training professors or outsourcing to online-only institutions. That‚Äôs on top of refunds for room and board and parts of tuition. On the other side, money isn‚Äôt coming back in, in the form of expected tuition and revenue from events such as athletics, conferences on campus and summer camps. College endowments, which can sometimes offer some insulation from hard financial times, have also taken a hit. ‚ÄúThis will touch every sector of higher education. Every size of institution, every region of the country,‚Äù says Dominique Baker, a professor of education policy at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. And it already has. The University of Michigan estimates it may lose up to $1 billion by the end of the year. For the University of Kentucky, it‚Äôs $70 million. Hundreds of schools ‚Äî including some with endowments of more than a billion dollars, like Duke University, Virginia Tech and Brown ‚Äî have announced hiring freezes. Other institutions have cut pay and have laid off staff and contractors. In Vermont, state officials have floated potential college shutdowns. Despite the fact that no institution will be spared, says Baker, the pandemic will affect different institutions in disproportionate ways. ‚ÄúFor some colleges, this is an extensional threat that means they‚Äôll have to close,‚Äù she says, while others will have the financial backing to weather the storm. What keeps her up at night? Those institutions that serve more vulnerable populations and are in more remote or rural places. Because, she says, they have the potential to feel the financial pain even more. There, students rely on colleges for services such as health care, campus jobs, child care and free food. Baker says those places, which have already been largely underfunded, will be hard-pressed to stay afloat. Good riddance to these outdated institutions. At one point they served an actual useful societal purpose. Unfortunately, starting in the 1960s, they were transformed into organizations that brainwashed students into accepting Jewish Marxist ideologies. They did this while charging insane amounts of money and putting students into massive debt. All for a piece of paper that was mostly worthless. Unless you got a degree in science, technology, engineering or medicine, the degree had little value. They‚Äôre also outdated because it is no longer a requirement for someone to physically travel to a specific place to gain knowledge and information. The Internet has changed all that. So when you combine this with the fact that we are facing the greatest economic collapse in all of history, who the hell is going to have money to spend to attend these institutions? Especially at the ripoff prices they were charging. There‚Äôs also a segment of the population who has bought into all this virus hysteria. These people will not want to attend college for health reasons. Based on all this, the entire economic model of these institutions is pretty much doomed. Some of the bigger schools might be able to last awhile with their endowments and name recognition, but many of them will not survive this collapse. This is probably for the best though. These colleges and universities did far more societal harm than good."
Idiot ‚ÄúNurses‚Äù are Counter-Protesting Lockdown Protesters,3371,"Just what in the fuck is this? We are allegedly in the middle of the deadliest pandemic in all of human history yet nurses somehow have the time to counter-protest people demanding an end to these retarded lockdowns. This seems like a bunch of bullshit if you ask me. Daily Mail: Healthcare workers clashed with anti lockdown protesters in Colorado on Sunday, defiantly standing in front of the cars of demonstrators who flocked to the state Capitol in their hundreds to urge Gov. Jared Polis to lift COVID-19-induced stay-at-home orders. Protests against state lockdowns implemented to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak continued nationwide this afternoon, as a fervent disdain for the restrictions that have shut down much of the country‚Äôs economy continues to slowly spread across the US. Titled ‚ÄòOperation Gridlock‚Äô, the day‚Äôs largest demonstration took place in Denver, where hundreds of protesters ignored social distancing guidelines to huddle together on the lawn of the state Capitol, waving flags emblazoned with slogans such as ‚ÄòYour ‚Äúhealth‚Äù does not supersede my right‚Äô, ‚ÄòFreedom over fear‚Äô, and ‚ÄòI would rather risk coronavirus than socialism‚Äô. Mobilized by a number of groups on social media, the protesters called Gov. Polis a tyrant and insisted the ongoing economic cost of the shutdown was no longer worth the few lives it would save. But the protesters‚Äô efforts weren‚Äôt met without resistance. A group of healthcare workers stood in the street, clad in their scrubs and facemasks, to counter-protest the calls for re-opening, silently obstructing cars as they drove down towards the Capitol. I question if these people are even real nurses or healthcare workers. For all we know they could be anti-fascists dressed up in nurse outfits. If they are real nurses, it proves once again that this pandemic doomsday scenario promoted by the Jewish media is a hoax. These nurses would be working 24 hours a day dealing with patients coming in if we were in the middle of a virus apocalypse. Instead, most hospitals around the country are empty and many have been laying off workers. Here‚Äôs another 60 nurses who somehow have time to whine about the lack of personal protective equipment. Over 60 RNs hit the streets outside of Sutter Eden Medical Center to honor fallen nurses and protest the lack of PPE which leaves health care staff, patients and their families vulnerable to contracting #COVID19.

California Governor Falsely States That People Have Rights,2949,"After public protests against California Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äôs lunatic lockdown order, Newsom made a very bizarre statement by falsely claiming that people still have free speech rights. LA Times: Gov. Gavin Newsom had some advice Saturday for people upset over the shut-down order, some of whom have started holding public protests, including one Friday in Huntington Beach. ‚ÄúI just want to encourage people that when you practice your free speech ‚Äî which I don‚Äôt [just] embrace, I celebrate ‚Äî just do so safely. This virus knows no political ideology. It doesn‚Äôt know if you are Republican or Democrat, supporting the president, opposing the president, so practice physical distancing. ‚ÄúMake sure that you are not infecting others. Even if you feel healthy and have no symptoms, you can spread this.‚Äù What Newsom is saying is insane. He‚Äôs saying that the protesters have a right to free speech while simultaneously claiming that they don‚Äôt have the right to free movement per his edict. By demanding people physically distance themselves from one another, he is violating the rights of people to express themselves freely. The right of a person to move freely is a Constitutional right and it can‚Äôt be suspended just because people in government say there is a doomsday virus floating around. And while this isn‚Äôt explicitly stated in the Constitution, there are Supreme Court rulings which have confirmed that freedom of movement is a protected right. The governor said he will not be swayed by public protests in deciding when to reopen the state. ‚ÄúWe are going to do the right thing, not judge by politics, not judge by protests, but by science.‚Äù A group of more than 100 protesters demanded that California ease stay-at-home restrictions that have helped slow the spread of the coronavirus. The protesters claimed the dangers of the coronavirus and benefits of social distancing are overblown, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. I‚Äôd also like to know what sort of science Newsom is referring to in order to justify the continued lockdown. All of the so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù were wrong about this and produced scary charts predicting mass amounts of death that never happened. Most of the people dying from this are old, fat or had some type of preexisting condition. It is very similar to the flu in that regard. There has also never been a time when governments around the world decided just to isolate all healthy people so a minimal number of sick people might be able to live a few months longer. So I‚Äôd say whatever science he is referring to is highly questionable. But his claim that people still have rights is ridiculous considering that he ordered a suspension of those rights by restricting free movement. This clown will probably make similar statements falsely claiming that people have rights even as he declares brutal police state and martial law measures to crackdown on further protests against his retarded lockdown."
Spain Extends Lockdown to May 9th,1397,"Spain announced that they are going to continue imposing their lunatic lockdown measures until May 9th. They did however say that they would allow children to leave the house after April 27th. How generous of them! AFP: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Saturday announced the nationwide coronavirus lockdown would be extended two weeks to May 9, hours after the official death toll passed 20,000. ‚ÄúWe have done the hardest part through responsibility and social discipline‚Ä¶ we are putting the most extreme moments behind us,‚Äù Sanchez said. But Spaniards must not jeopardise the fragile gains made so far with hasty decisions. The restrictions currently in place would however be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from April 27, said Sanchez. Until now only adults have been able to leave the house for specific reasons: to go to work, to go shopping for food or medicine, for a medical appointment or to walk the dog. But there were growing calls to let children outside, as is permitted in most other countries observing a lockdown. I can only imagine what historians are going to say about this period of time. Governments locking down healthy people including children all to try and extend the life of some old and fat people for a few months. We are truly living through the most insane period of time in all of human history. Nothing like this has ever happened before."
Coronavirus is Allegedly Racist Against Niggers,2673,"Mainstream news is whining about how the coronavirus is disproportionally killing niggers. AP: As a clearer picture emerges of COVID-19‚Äôs decidedly deadly toll on black Americans, leaders are demanding a reckoning of the systemic policies they say have made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus, including inequity in access to health care and economic opportunity. A growing chorus of medical professionals, activists and political figures is pressuring the federal government to not just release comprehensive racial demographic data of the country‚Äôs coronavirus victims, but also to outline clear strategies to blunt the devastation on African Americans and other communities of color. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its first breakdown of COVID-19 case data by race, showing that 30% of patients whose race was known were black. The federal data was missing racial information for 75% of all cases, however, and did not include any demographic breakdown of deaths. The latest Associated Press analysis of available state and local data shows that nearly one-third of those who have died are African American, with black people representing about 14% of the population in the areas covered in the analysis. That‚Äôs an interesting analysis. I‚Äôve made the same argument about how niggers commit the majority of crimes relative to their population and concluded that this is a behavioral problem with niggers. When I brought up this point, I was accused of being an evil nigger-hating racist who hates their skin color. Even though I am absolutely a nigger-hating racist who hates niggers simply because of their skin color, the media can no longer claim that my point is invalid. That‚Äôs because they are using the same argument I‚Äôve made about nigger criminality to claim that the coronavirus is racist and impacting niggers more so than other races. Either way, I could not give a shit if the coronavirus is killing more niggers than other races. Most of these niggers who have died of the coronavirus were fat and did not go on a diet. There are also too many niggers on the planet right now and being a nigger-hating racist like myself, I think it is funny seeing lots of niggers die from a viral infection. The media should really be blaming Oprah for this. She set a bad example for her fellow niggers by being fat and parading her fat ass on television for the past three decades. If she actually gave a damn about her race, she would have set a proper example and gone on a real diet. That would have given her credibility to tell her fellow niggers to also go on a diet so they wouldn‚Äôt die of the coronavirus."
Anti-Anxiety Medication Prescriptions Up 34 Percent,1556,"As expected, this continued lockdown is resulting in a surge of mental health problems. Prescriptions for anti-anxiety and antidepressants have increased substantially. Marketwatch: The coronavirus is taking a toll on mental health. The number of prescriptions for antidepressant, anti-anxiety and anti-insomnia medications filled per week increased 21% between Feb. 16 and March 15, 2020, according to a new report by Express Scripts, a Cigna-owned CI, -0.62% pharmacy benefit manager. The study analyzed prescription claims filled between Jan. 19 and March 15 of this year among a sample of more than 31.5 million commercially-insured individuals, and found that claims peaked during the week ending March 15, when the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Anti-anxiety drugs saw the biggest spike, jumping 34.1%, which was more than double the number of insomnia aids (14.8%), and almost twice as high as antidepressants (18.6%). This is more proof showing that the response to the coronavirus has been far more damaging than the virus itself. Most of the people who reportedly died from the coronavirus were old, fat or had preexisting health issues. These are people who would have died from something else any way. But instead of simply isolating the highest risk people, the people in government decided to enforce these absurd lockdowns while simultaneously destroying the economy in the process. I hope the virus doomsday-promoters are happy with themselves. They‚Äôve totally fucked the world with their endless hysterics."
People are Very Angry With Bill Gates,2649,"Bill Gates the co-founder of Microsoft has made people very upset. Thank you to all of the health care workers who are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. A post shared by Bill Gates (@thisisbillgates) on Apr 5, 2020 at 8:05am PDT Fox News: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is being targeted and harassed on social media in the wake of his comments criticizing the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. decision to withdraw funds from the World Health Organization. On a recent Instagram post thanking health care workers, the billionnaire philanthropist was subjected to hundreds of thousands of comments calling him a partisan and linking him to a wide range of bizarre conspiracy theories. Gates is no stranger to online trolls, but the attacks against him have intensified recently. The Gates Foundation is the second-largest financial backer of the WHO after the United States. The organization has also committed about $250 million for research and testing related to COVID-19. Facebook, which owns Instagram, already prohibits harassment and coordinated inauthentic activity. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at this behavior carefully to determine whether it violates our policies. People on our services are allowed to speak freely, and do so in an organized way, but we remove accounts that are fake or designed to mislead. We also remove comments that violate our Community Guidelines, such as hate speech or death threats,‚Äùa Facebook spokesperson told Fox News via email. These people are alleging a number of things about Mr. Gates. The allegations are primarily centered around him trying to forcibly vaccinate populations, microchipping people and controlling people with 5G technology. Some people like Alex Jones have alleged that Mr. Gates is working directly for Satan. I don‚Äôt know if these things are true or not. What I will say is that we have every right to be angry with Mr. Gates. This is the person who tortured us with shitty computer operating systems like Windows Vista and Windows Millennium Edition. The amount of mental anguish and psychological torture people went through using those horrible operating systems was a major crime. I say Mr. Gates should be locked up and put on trial for crimes against humanity for his role in the creation of those awful computer operating systems. This is something we can definitively prove whereas I can not independently confirm that he is trying to forcibly vaccinate us on behalf of Satan. I am hopeful however that Alex Jones can eventually provide us with documents that confirm Mr. Gates employment status with Satan."
Tucker Does Historic Interview With New Jersey‚Äôs Governor,3693,"Tucker Carlson did an interview with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy last night. The interview was historic because it revealed how stupid and retarded these virus lockdown edicts have been. None of Murphy‚Äôs explanations for the state lockdown made any rational sense. It was just him refusing to answer Tucker‚Äôs questions while stammering about gibberish and talking about his supposed love in God. Murphy did admit that he didn‚Äôt think about the Bill of Rights when issuing the insane lockdown order and said that liquor stores were still open because of mental health reasons. Both of which were completely insane statements. Anglin paraphrased the interview in his analysis of the interview. I‚Äôm just going to paste it here because it provides a good gist of what happened. Q: What is the purpose of the lockdown? You first said it was to stop the spread of the virus, then today in a speech you said you can‚Äôt see normal gatherings continue until there are essentially no more cases. Why the change? A: [Talking points about lives being more important than the economy and flattening the curve] Q: We don‚Äôt do this for any other infectious disease, including ones that kill more people than this disease. So why is shutting everything down indefinitely the standard in this case? A: We need randomized testing. Q: Once you get randomized testing, what do you expect the mortality rate will be? A: Well, the data shows it‚Äôs higher than influenza, please God. I don‚Äôt have an answer, but it appears to be higher. My blessed souls. Q: The end number for coronavirus is expected to be 60,000, which is fewer than the flu in 2017-18. And there‚Äôs a vaccine for the flu. Does this shake your faith in your decision to destroy the economy? A: My faith is unshakable. We flattened the curve by shutting everything down. Q: You‚Äôve kept the liquor stores open, so this isn‚Äôt actually a quarantine. A: People need alcohol for their mental health. Q: But you‚Äôve closed church services. A: The churches said it‚Äôs okay. Q: What was the scientific basis for deciding that sitting in a church is more dangerous than going to a liquor store, in terms of the spread of the virus? A: I‚Äôve spoken to the Jews and the Moslems, and they both said it‚Äôs fine. Q: Why did you arrest a guy for sitting alone on a beach? A: A lot of people drove in from out of state. Q: The Bill of Rights enshrines the freedom of religion, by what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights? A: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this‚Äù (that‚Äôs a direct quote, not a paraphrasing). Q: Where did you get this authority to just take away the Constitution? A: Tucker, there‚Äôs a disease. Q: You can‚Äôt just tell people who they‚Äôre allowed to talk to. A: I called a priest and said I was worried about the drive-thru. God bless em. Q: You‚Äôve created unimaginable suffering with this lockdown. How much does that weigh on you? A: Facts and science. The responses to Tucker‚Äôs questions by Murphy were so strange that they were difficult to comprehend. I have no idea if Murphy is just a stupid retard who got caught up in all the virus hysteria or if he is being blackmailed and was forced to issue this crazy lockdown order. But the fact that he was unable to answer Tucker‚Äôs questions with straight forward responses indicates that there is definitely something weird going on with this guy. He could be a kiddie-fucker for all we know. Whatever the actual truth is probably doesn‚Äôt even matter because the damage is already done. But at least we have Tucker‚Äôs interview for the historical record. Future generations will be able to see how insane America‚Äôs political leadership was at the time when all this happened."
22 Million People Have Now Filed for Unemployment,1626,"As expected, the new unemployment numbers were not good. NBC News: Around 5 million more people filed first-time unemployment claims last week as the coronavirus pandemic continues to devastate the job market in every sector of the economy. The staggering weekly number comes as President Donald Trump weighs plans to pull back on the social distancing measures that have shuttered businesses across the country and to reopen parts of the economy as soon as May 1. State-mandated lockdowns have choked vast parts of the once-booming economy, kicking a total of 22 million people out of work and launching the nation into the worst crisis since the Great Depression. In the last 4 weeks, the number of unemployment claims in the U.S. has reached 22 million ‚Äî a toll not seen since the Great Depression. ‚ÄúThis is the deepest, fastest, most broad-based recession we‚Äôve ever seen,"" said one economist. https://t.co/j5ReGMEm0k ‚Äî The New York Times (@nytimes) April 16, 2020 This is not the end. You can expect many more millions to file for unemployment next week and this is going to continue for awhile. There is no flattening this curve. Many people are going to suffer and die because of this historic unemployment. It‚Äôs undoubtedly a far greater problem than the virus. There is no denying this. We will likely be at somewhere between 30 percent to 50 percent unemployment when all is said and done. All because numerous state governors decided that they wanted to quarantine the healthy instead of the sick. Historians are going to look back at this period of time as the most retarded period of time in all of human history."
Bill Gates is Angry That Trump Defunded the WHO,1777,"Bill Gates who made billions of dollars selling a manipulated stolen variation of an operating system, has somehow managed to convince the world that he is an expert on public health. He was none to happy that Donald Trump decided to defund the World Health Organization otherwise known as the WHO. He was so mad in fact, that he posted a tweet about it. Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever. ‚Äî Bill Gates (@BillGates) April 15, 2020 So what exactly do we need the WHO for Bill? What has the WHO done that we can recognize as a tangible accomplishment? I doubt Bill would be able to name a single thing. Much of the WHO‚Äôs budget goes to holding stupid meetings and press conferences where nothing of value gets accomplished. They‚Äôre a retarded bureaucracy that only exists to advance global Jewish agendas. The WHO was publicly against banning travel when the coronavirus outbreak started in China and they told people that masks weren‚Äôt effective in preventing infection. If anything the WHO is not good for public health. They are the very opposite of that since they‚Äôve been totally wrong on everything that‚Äôs happened with the coronavirus. Bill is just mad at what Trump has done because the WHO is a big promoter of vaccinations just like Bill is. For some strange reason, Bill wants to use the coronavirus hysteria to justify some type of weird vaccination program across the world. I have no idea why Bill is such a big promoter of this vaccine nonsense, but Alex Jones thinks he is working for Satan and that‚Äôs as good of an explanation as any."
Big Tech Steps Up Fight Against ‚ÄúBad Info‚Äù,1791,"The stupid goyim need the great geniuses at big technology companies to think for them. That‚Äôs why these companies are stepping up their fight against ‚Äúbad info.‚Äù AP: Potentially dangerous coronavirus misinformation has spread from continent to continent like the pandemic itself, forcing the world‚Äôs largest tech companies to take unprecedented action to protect public health. Facebook, Google and others have begun using algorithms, new rules and factual warnings to knock down harmful coronavirus conspiracy theories, questionable ads and unproven remedies that regularly crop up on their services ‚Äî and which could jeopardize lives. Health officials, critics and others who have long implored the tech companies to step up their response to viral falsehoods have welcomed the new effort, saying the platforms are now working faster than ever to scrub their sites of coronavirus misinformation. ‚ÄúIt was definitely, within the companies, a shift,‚Äù said Andy Pattison, manager of digital solutions for the World Health Organization, who for nearly two years has urged companies like Facebook to take more aggressive action against anti-vaccination misinformation. The fact that some fuckhead from the World Health Organization is endorsing what these big technology companies are doing says it all. Just because somebody has a differing view on vaccines or the coronavirus hysteria than what is stated in the Jew-run media, doesn‚Äôt mean that it is ‚Äúbad info.‚Äù In fact, if it is reported in the Jew-run media there is a much greater chance of it actually being bad info. And if these people think that the average person is too stupid to differentiate good info from bad info, than why do they talk about how great democracy is? They are by doing this, making an argument against democracy."
Michigan: Big Protest Against Lockdown Order by Cunt Governor,1317,"People in Michigan have gotten fed up with the retarded lockdown order issued by the cunt governor and staged a massive protest against it today. Here are some clips showing what took place. A number of county sheriffs have said that they won‚Äôt enforce the cunt governor‚Äôs retarded order. Four Michigan sheriffs say they will not enforce @GovWhitmer‚Äôs orders https://t.co/gGqiwwf7ZG ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 15, 2020 I said for the past few weeks that it would be impossible to keep people locked in their homes forever. People are beginning to see how stupid and ridiculous this whole situation is. You effectively have a quarantine of the healthy and not the sick. All over something that is no more dangerous than the flu. The cunt governor also made the mistake of issuing an order that did crazy things like banning stores from selling things like seeds but still allowed marijuana to be sold and babies to be aborted. It‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a micromanaging cunt who gets off on having the power to fuck with people‚Äôs livelihood. If this bitch doesn‚Äôt lift the lockdown soon and continues going on television smirking about how she‚Äôs fucking with people, she‚Äôs going to seriously regret it. Civil society is breaking down and she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand the gravity of the situation."
Warning of Food Shortage as Major Pork Plant Closes,2421,"A major pork plant in the United States has closed as a result of the coronavirus hysteria. The company that runs the plant also warned of a potential food shortage. Reuters: Smithfield Foods, the world‚Äôs biggest pork processor, said on Sunday it will shut a U.S. plant indefinitely due to a rash of coronavirus cases among employees and warned the country was moving ‚Äúperilously close to the edge‚Äù in supplies for grocers. Slaughterhouse shutdowns are disrupting the U.S. food supply chain, crimping availability of meat at retail stores and leaving farmers without outlets for their livestock. Smithfield extended the closure of its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant after initially saying it would idle temporarily for cleaning. The facility is one of the nation‚Äôs largest pork processing facilities, representing 4% to 5% of U.S. pork production, according to the company. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said on Saturday that 238 Smithfield employees had active cases of the new coronavirus, accounting for 55% of the state‚Äôs total. Noem and the mayor of Sioux Falls had recommended the company shut the plant, which has about 3,700 workers, for at least two weeks. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running,‚Äù Smithfield Chief Executive Ken Sullivan said in a statement on Sunday. ‚ÄúThese facility closures will also have severe, perhaps disastrous, repercussions for many in the supply chain, first and foremost our nation‚Äôs livestock farmers.‚Äù This is obviously not a good sign. There have already been all sorts of major supply disruptions but if we start seeing big disruptions with the food supply, that‚Äôs when things could get really bad. People can virtue signal all they want with pointless slogans like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù or some other bullshit. But when you have millions of people who are hungry and have no food to eat, all that civility will quickly go out the window. The fact that there‚Äôs been little to no talk about how important it is to keep the food industry going is deeply concerning. As much as I am against government bailouts, the food industry is one of the few industries that one could reasonably argue is worth temporarily propping up. But who knows, maybe none of that will be necessary. Maybe the government will come up with a plan to provide the American people with tasty green nutrient squares so we can all avoid mass starvation."
UK: Lockdown May Continue Until Coronavirus Cure is Found,1550,"The people in top positions of governments around the world have pretty much gone completely insane over the coronavirus. A top official within the British healthcare system is implying that all these crazy restrictions may continue indefinitely until a cure for the coronavirus is found. Mirror: Our top medic tonight indicated life may not return to normal until a cure for Covid-19 is found. The Sunday People asked NHS England medical director Stephen Powis if some restrictions might still be needed 18 months from now. He said: ‚ÄúThis was never going to be a sprint of a few weeks. It is going to be a marathon. ‚ÄúThe job of scientists and doctors is to provide the Government with the best possible strategies to manage this virus over the months to come, and probably over longer than months.‚Äù A vaccine is between a year to 18 months away ‚Äì and there are as yet no successful drugs to combat it. I think it is safe to say that society will have completely collapsed well before they reach the point of having a cure. If they think they can keep millions of people locked inside their homes for that amount of time they‚Äôre out of their minds. Especially when you consider the minimal amount of deaths this virus has caused. All these weird dystopic plans to forcibly vaccinate people and what not is not going to work if you have millions of people rioting because they have no food to eat. And that‚Äôs where all this is going to head if you tell people they can‚Äôt go to work and live normal lives because of some mystery alleged doomsday virus."
Churches Face Financial Ruin Due to Virus Hysteria,2207,"The virus hysteria is impacting churches around the country. The collection plates are empty due to these crazy lockdowns! Reuters: St. Anselm Roman Catholic Church in New York‚Äôs Brooklyn borough is used to limping along, month after month, at a budget deficit of several thousand dollars a week. But the church that sits in the city that is the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus pandemic could always count on Easter. Last year, its Easter pew collection brought in $11,651. That was more than twice an average Sunday and, coupled with the church‚Äôs online Easter donations of $2,500, enough to cover its weekly operating expenses of $13,000, according to church records. Like most churches around the United States, St. Anselm‚Äôs will be closed on Sunday, its members unable to gather and its priests unable to meet with them as the nation endures its worst public-health crisis in a century. But just as American churches have been unable to meet their members‚Äô spiritual needs ‚Äî perhaps most painfully represented in the absence of public funerals for the thousands who have died ‚Äî they also have faced their own unmet needs in the form of untouched collection baskets. I honestly couldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck if these churches go under. Most of them don‚Äôt even promote real Christianity and falsely claim that Jews are the chosen people of God. One of the main reasons why we‚Äôve been forced to live in such a fucked up and deranged society is because these churches failed to effectively stand up to any of the Jewish insanity that was taking place. They feared being called names by Jews so they said nothing while Jews pushed gay marriage, child trannies and other weird shit on to the public. And then you have the evangelicals who have promoted all this weird doomsday and rapture nonsense while telling people how great Israel is. It‚Äôs no wonder why younger people have little interest in Christianity. It‚Äôs because these churches have been corrupted by evil and sin. So let these fake Christians face financial ruin. Maybe once that happens, some real Christians who call out these evil Jews for what they are can replace them as spiritual leaders. And always remember, the Jews killed Jesus Christ."
Sweden‚Äôs Coronavirus Deaths Decrease Despite No Lockdown,1930,"Sweden unlike most other countries, did not impose all these stupid restrictions on their people. The number of coronavirus deaths in their country has been decreasing. Daily Mail: Sweden‚Äôs daily death toll and its number of new coronavirus cases both fell today as the country continues to hold out against imposing a lockdown. The 77 new deaths ‚Äì down from 106 yesterday ‚Äì bring the total from 793 to 870, according to figures from Sweden‚Äôs public health agency. The number of confirmed infections went up by 544, a drop of nearly a quarter from yesterday‚Äôs near-record figure of 722. It takes the total number of cases from 9,141 to 9,685. ‚Ä¶ Unlike most of Europe, Sweden has not imposed a lockdown, and primary schools, shops, cafes, restaurants and bars remain open. People are not generally ordered to stay at home, although they are told to isolate at the first sign of ‚Äòslight cold-like symptoms‚Äô. Swedes are advised to ‚Äòkeep your distance‚Äô at gyms and sports facilities rather than avoiding them altogether. There is a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people, but the rule is far more generous than the limit of two that Britain and Germany have set. You would think that people would look at what was done in Sweden and conclude that it was totally unnecessary to implement all these insane restrictions and destroy much of the global economy in the process. But instead of doing that, we are seeing even greater restrictions implemented and more dire predictions being made. We now have a situation where the global economy has been damaged to such an extent, that there is an agenda to keep these restrictions in place as long as possible. All these political figures will eventually have to justify why they chose to destroy the global economy. So it is in their interest to spread as much doom and fear about the coronavirus as possible. This is why they are downplaying and ignoring this data coming out of Sweden."
"Dr. Doom Revises Coronavirus Death Projection to 60,000",4689,"Dr. Doom recently revised projected coronavirus deaths to around 60,000. He was saying that we were going to see three to four times this number just a short time ago. The Hill: Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the Trump administration‚Äôs coronavirus task force, said Thursday he thinks the U.S. death toll from the virus could be much lower than the 100,000 to 200,000 first estimated by the White House. Fauci said on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show that given widespread mitigation efforts, the death toll will likely be closer to 60,000 as the U.S. now has more data about the growth and spread of the virus throughout the country. ‚ÄúI believe we are going to see a downturn in that, and it looks more like the 60,000 [range] than the 100,000 to 200,000,‚Äù Fauci said. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, credited social distancing practices being implemented across the country for helping reduce the spread of the virus and in turn help lower models for the estimated number of deaths. ‚ÄúI think the American public have done a really terrific job just buckling down and doing those physical separations and adhering to those guidelines. ‚Ä¶ Models are really only as good as the assumptions that you put into the model,‚Äù he said. Keep in mind that this guy went from saying that the coronavirus wasn‚Äôt going to be a problem early in the year to claiming that millions could die, to slowly backing off on those projections as the data began proving those projections false. He‚Äôs literally been wrong every step of the way even though his sole job is centered around the analysis of infections. Imagine being that shitty at your job. Either this man is totally incompetent or he has been intentionally spreading fear for some sort of nefarious purpose. But if we suspend disbelief and assume that this new projection is somehow accurate, we are looking at a situation that isn‚Äôt much different from flu seasons we‚Äôve seen in the past. Alex Berenson says it best here. Nobody says COVID-19 is not real, that it can't tax hospitals or kill people, esp. if they are over 75 or have comorbidities. But right now the best CURRENT projection is for 61,000 US deaths. That was the 2017 flu season. Why have we shut the country?https://t.co/OMStr4jd6i ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 9, 2020 Fauci is claiming that the reason why the death totals are so low is because Americans are doing such a great job social distancing themselves from one another. But the projections he was promoting all had social distancing built into their models. This shows that this fool has been hoaxing the public with bullshit models and statistics in order to spread maximum fear and panic. It‚Äôs understandable that your models would be off a bit, but these numbers have been consistently wrong by enormous margins. And I didn‚Äôt realize this earlier but back during the 1980s, Fauci promoted all sorts of hysteria about AIDS and lied about it. He falsely claimed that it wasn‚Äôt a disease that primarily affected homosexuals due to their disgusting lifestyles fueled by drugs and anal sex. So based on his track record, it is no surprise that he would be spreading fear and doom about the coronavirus. He‚Äôs had substantial experience hoaxing the public with scary infections. Dr. Deborah Birx who has been a fixture at these coronavirus press conferences alongside Dr. Doom even admitted that they were inflating the coronavirus death statistics! NY Post: The federal government is classifying the deaths of patients infected with the coronavirus as COVID-19 deaths, regardless of any underlying health issues that could have contributed to the loss of someone‚Äôs life. Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, said the federal government is continuing to count the suspected COVID-19 deaths, despite other nations doing the opposite. ‚ÄúThere are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition, and let‚Äôs say the virus caused you to go to the ICU [intensive care unit] and then have a heart or kidney problem,‚Äù she said during a Tuesday news briefing at the White House. ‚ÄúSome countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death. ‚ÄúThe intent is ‚Ä¶ if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,‚Äù she added. It‚Äôs become clear that Fauci and Birx have played major roles in hoaxing the public and helped fuel a mass hysteria that has destroyed the entire economy. It is utterly shameful what they have done. I‚Äôm sure when the 60,000 number doesn‚Äôt prove out they‚Äôll revise their models again to claim that 50,000 or 40,000 or 30,000 will die. The whole situation is utterly ridiculous."
Jew Ezekiel Emanuel Wants 18 Month Lockdown,4065,"The fallout from this coronavirus hysteria is getting increasingly more insane. The Jew architect of Obamacare and son of an Israeli terrorist Ezekiel Emanuel has been on television publicly stating that everyone has to stay locked down in their homes for the next 18 months until a coronavirus vaccine is developed. He‚Äôs also making hysterical claims that millions could die if we do not do exactly as he says. Here‚Äôs what he said during an appearance on MSNBC. No one is immune to the COVID-19 virus. It threatens all of us. But while we are all experiencing the same pandemic, we are not experiencing it in the same way. The first dividing line is whether you or someone you love has gotten sick. Many Americans have not yet seen firsthand what devastation a positive test can inflict. Another dividing line is whether you have a job that lets you stay at home, working as you juggle child care and video chats. 60 million Americans are still out there not sheltering in place and instead tirelessly working to keep everything going for the rest of us. You keep the electricity flowing and the internet running, food and groceries moving. You are putting your own health on the line to ensure the rest of us are living as normally as possible. And then there are the tens of millions of Americans who have lost jobs and businesses, or who fear that they‚Äôre just about to. Your anxiety about the virus is coupled with worry over having a paycheck, covering the mortgage, keeping the lights on, and buying food. Realistically, COVID-19 will be here for the next 18 months or more. We will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications. I know that‚Äôs dreadful news to hear. How are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? Is all that economic pain worth trying to stop COVID-19? The truth is we have no choice. If we prematurely end that physical distancing and the other measures keeping it at bay, deaths could skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands if not a million. We cannot return to normal until there‚Äôs a vaccine. Conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure. He was also interviewed on an ABC News podcast making similar statements. He even went so far as to say that the virus was going to be with us through the summer and that we can‚Äôt go back to normal until we have zero cases. This is clearly lunatic-tier bullshit this kike is pushing. The coronavirus has proven to be no more dangerous than the flu. And that‚Äôs even if we consider the statistically inflated death totals that are being reported. Keeping everyone locked down like this for another 18 months is obviously impractical and speaks to a much larger and broader agenda at play. It could be that they‚Äôre just trying to prolong the lockdown as long as possible because the economy has collapsed and they need time to prepare for a war with China. It could be that this is part of an intentional agenda to push forced vaccinations and other weird science fiction type agendas on the population. Or it could be a situation where everyone legitimately bought into this weird doomsday hysteria and now they‚Äôre just trying to prolong the lockdown because they don‚Äôt know what else to do. The only thing we know for certain is that none of this is going to end well. The economic damage from this hysteria is already done and that‚Äôs the real problem we need to be focused on. The virus is not a significant problem. Hospitals around the country are empty and healthcare workers are being laid off. If this was any sort of real problem, the hospitals would have been overwhelmed. This situation never materialized. The good news is that it doesn‚Äôt appear as if Emanuel‚Äôs calls for an 18 month lockdown are being taken seriously. But regardless, we should fully expect to see all sorts of lies and propaganda promoted by the Jewish establishment to justify continuing this lockdown for as long as possible."
Doomsday Kook Andrew Cuomo Says NY Won‚Äôt Return to Normal,1678,"This fool just won‚Äôt quit will he? CNBC: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak could ‚Äústabilize‚Äù within weeks if the state maintains strict social distancing policies, even as he announced the highest daily death count yet and said life for New Yorkers will never be the same. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we return to normal. I don‚Äôt think we return to yesterday,‚Äù Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. ‚ÄúI think if we‚Äôre smart, we achieve a new normal.‚Äù The governor offered a glimmer of hope that the state‚Äôs stringent policies ‚Äî closing nonessential businesses and requiring residents to stay home ‚Äî are helping to slow down the spread of the virus. Those social distancing measures are working, he said: ‚ÄúIt is flattening the curve.‚Äù If those rules are maintained, he said, there‚Äôs reason to believe the health ‚Äúsystem should stabilize over these next couple of weeks.‚Äù So he‚Äôs saying that New York won‚Äôt go back to normal and that we won‚Äôt return to yesterday. It‚Äôs obvious that he‚Äôs doing everything he can to keep the population in fear and the economy closed. So @NYGovCuomo has reported ICU patients and discharges for weeks. Not today. Just new hospitalizations ‚Äì which are now 2/5 what they were a week ago ‚Äì and deaths (a lagging indicator, as he said). I wonder why. And, oh yeah, a promise NY won‚Äôt go back to normal anytime soon. pic.twitter.com/XkAs8X3XbL ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 8, 2020 I guess he hasn‚Äôt gotten the memo that this course of action is unsustainable. He will not be able to keep people locked inside their homes forever. It will be interesting to see how long he keeps pushing this insane doomsday nonsense."
Preexisting Illnesses Rampant Among New York‚Äôs COVID-19 Deaths,1340,"It‚Äôs now confirmed that most of New York‚Äôs reported coronavirus deaths were people who already had preexisting illnesses. We saw the same thing in Italy so this isn‚Äôt a surprise. USA Today: The majority of New York‚Äôs more than 4,700 deaths due to coronavirus were among men, and 86% of all deaths were among people who had underlying illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes, new state data shows. The statistics released late Monday offered the latest glimpse into how the rapidly spreading virus has impacted New York and made it the epicenter for COVID-19 in the nation. Of the 4,758 deaths in New York since the first on March 14, 61% were men and 39% were women, the state Department of Health reported on its new data portal. In addition, 63% of the deaths were among those age 70 and older, while 7% of the cases were those 49 and younger. When you combine this data with the fact that the CDC instructed hospitals to inflate coronavirus deaths based on assumptions instead of tests, it further illustrates how this whole situation has been grossly exaggerated. There is no virus apocalypse. What we are seeing with these deaths isn‚Äôt much different than what you would see during your average flu season. The people who have spread all this doom and fear must be held accountable for the panic-induced hysteria they have caused."
Virus Hysteria Threatening America‚Äôs Supply Chain,1536,"There‚Äôs been so much doom and fear being spread by idiotic politicians and media pundits about this alleged virus of doom, that truck drivers are becoming less willing to haul goods. Kansas City Star: As the number of COVID-19 deaths in Johnson County increased to a total of nine Monday, truckers are sounding the alarm that the the nation‚Äôs supply chain could be in jeopardy if the government doesn‚Äôt help protect them. Truckers say that every day, they are hauling needed goods into COVID-19 hot spots with no protective equipment, testing capabilities or ways to self-quarantine or seek treatment if they become sick. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association sent a letter Friday to President Donald Trump on Friday saying: ‚ÄúHELP ‚Äî MAYDAY ‚Äî 9-1-1.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight now professional drivers are busting their butts to care for the nation,‚Äù said the letter, signed by Todd Spencer, president and CEO of the Grain Valley-based organization. ‚ÄúTheir hard work and personal sacrifice should not include their health or even their lives if at all possible or preventable.‚Äù America‚Äôs truck drivers are vital to the nation‚Äôs economy. If they stop delivering essential products, the country will quickly descend into chaos. The only reason that this hasn‚Äôt happened yet is because critical products are still making their way to store shelves. But with all the virus hysteria and all the economic damage that‚Äôs already been done because of this lunatic lockdown situation, there‚Äôs no guarantee that the supply chain will continue to operate."
NYC: Javits and Navy Ship Hospitals are Mostly Empty,3127,"The emergency hospital setup at the Javits Center and the big Navy hospital ship docked in New York City‚Äôs harbor are mostly empty. From the looks of things, it appears as if they barely processed any patients. NPR: The USNS Comfort hospital ship and an emergency hospital at the Javits Center are meant to be relief valves for hospitals in New York City, where more than 14,000 people have been hospitalized for COVID-19. But the facilities have been largely empty, leading officials to try to streamline their operations. Now, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is hoping the Comfort can join the Javits Center on the front line of the fight against the coronavirus. Cuomo said Monday that he will ask President Trump to allow the Navy ship to be used to treat COVID-19 patients, noting that the local health care system is under too much stress. ‚ÄúHospitals are pulling off miracles on a daily basis,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúBut it is a monumental challenge to sustain this pace.‚Äù So much for this doomsday virus. If there was a major problem, both the Javits Center and the Navy hospital ship would be filled with patients right now. Despite it being increasingly obvious that there is no medical crisis, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is still continuing to act as though we are in the middle of an apocalypse in order to justify his insane decision to shut everything down. He‚Äôs even continuing the false claim that his state‚Äôs hospital system is on the verge of collapse. #BREAKING: I spoke to the president and he has agreed to our request to treat #COVID patients on the USNS Comfort. This means 1,000 additional beds staffed by federal personnel. This will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems. ‚Äî Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) April 6, 2020 To reinforce this narrative, he announced that he was increasing fines for people who violate the state-mandated social distancing rules. Getting Team Apocalypse to accept reality may be harder than I thought. What will he do when hospitalizations fall another 75%? Jail time? https://t.co/tvWuXXXnXg ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 6, 2020 The problem Cuomo has is that the numbers being provided in his own press briefings are not matching up with the narrative he‚Äôs selling. A chart shown at his press conference today detailed a massive decline in new hospitalizations. It's over, guys. It's already over. Longer thread coming. https://t.co/AiTz0jVFoW ‚Äî Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 6, 2020 It‚Äôs actually crazy that Cuomo thinks he can continue hoaxing the public like this. He‚Äôll have no choice but to dial back the doom and fear. He doesn‚Äôt have the data to reinforce it any longer. I wish him lots of luck in trying to explain why he destroyed the entire state‚Äôs economy while demanding billions of dollars in resources that were never used or needed. And he‚Äôs by no means the only person who is in this position. All the people who lied to us about this virus to justify these extreme and draconian measures need to be held accountable. What they did to this country and the American people is a high crime and they should be dealt with accordingly."
UK: People Keep Destroying 5G Gear Over COVID-19 Fears,1482,"Despite attempts by British telecom providers to convince the public that 5G equipment does not help spread the coronavirus, they have not been able to prevent people from destroying their 5G gear. People are continuing to do this. Not only are people destroying 5G equipment, but they‚Äôre threatening the engineers and technicians who are installing and maintaining the gear. We have received several reports of criminal damage to phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. Those responsible for criminal acts will face the full force of the law.
The facts ‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/QWYcc4bOEg ‚Äî DCMS (@DCMS) April 5, 2020 I have not seen any concrete proof that 5G has anything to do with the coronavirus. And in some respects, the theory that it is causing or accelerating the spread of the coronavirus is slightly bizarre. But it is certainly not any less bizarre than some of the deranged bullshit promoted by the Jewish propaganda machine. What I will say about this is that there was never any real public debate about some of the health concerns people had about this technology. So this has helped fuel all of this paranoia to the point where people are just going out and setting fire to the equipment. And the fact that you have millions of people forced into their homes by government edicts over an alleged doomsday virus is certainly not helpful in trying to contain people‚Äôs paranoia about this technology."
Negro Surgeon General Now Says People Should Wear Masks,2184,"The Negro affirmative action Surgeon General Jerome Adams was literally telling people not to buy masks a month ago. He said that they were not effective in preventing the spread of the doomsday virus and claimed that people buying masks were bad because they were preventing healthcare providers from having them for their sick patients. He even posted a tweet about it! Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can‚Äôt get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!
https://t.co/UxZRwxxKL9 ‚Äî U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020 When I was on Azzmador‚Äôs show a few weeks back we talked about how retarded this was. Special masks like the N95 mask absolutely limit the spread of illnesses. If they didn‚Äôt, doctors wouldn‚Äôt be wearing them when performing surgeries and treating patients. To tell people that they don‚Äôt prevent the spread of illnesses was totally irresponsible. Now a month later, this same nigger is encouraging people to wear masks to help protect them from the coronavirus. He‚Äôs even featured in a CDC video showing people how they can make masks out of cloth! #DYK? CDC‚Äôs recommendation on wearing a cloth face covering may help protect the most vulnerable from #COVID19. Watch @Surgeon_General Jerome Adams make a face covering in a few easy steps. https://t.co/bihJ3xEM15 pic.twitter.com/mE7Tf6y3MK ‚Äî CDC (@CDCgov) April 4, 2020 It doesn‚Äôt get any dumber than this. It‚Äôs utterly cartoonish what we are witnessing. I have no idea if this is just the result of this nigger being an incompetent retard, or if this is part of a larger conspiracy. I‚Äôll let you be the judge. All I know is that this is a very fucked up situation as it further reveals how dysfunctional everything is becoming. Either way, none of this is going to matter much in the next few weeks. All of the attention is going to shift from this doomsday virus bullshit to the economic fallout that has resulted from the hysteria. Whether you should or shouldn‚Äôt wear a mask is not going to be of much concern to people who have no food to eat."
5G Towers Burned Over Theories They Spread Coronavirus,1876,"The media is claiming that ‚Äúidiots‚Äù and ‚Äúconspiracy nuts‚Äù are destroying 5G towers in the United Kingdom due to theories that they are helping spread the coronavirus. The Sun: CONSPIRACY nuts are reportedly setting phone masts alight and targeting engineers after a bizarre claim 5G ‚Äúradiation‚Äù caused the deadly coronavirus spread. The theory originated last month after a video filmed at a US health conference claimed Africa was not as affected by the disease because it is ‚Äúnot a 5G region‚Äù. The myth was quickly debunked after the World Health Organisation confirmed there were thousands of Covid-19 cases in Africa. The government has also confirmed there is ‚Äúno evidence to suggest that 5G has anything to do with Covid-19‚Äù. Celebs have been slammed for sharing the conspiracy theory, including Jason Gardiner and Callum Best, who posted similar claims that 5G can impact the immune system. But the claims have still been doing the rounds on WhatsApp via a lengthy voice note ‚Äì with phone masts now being set alight in the UK. Engineers are now also being targeted with social media users encouraging each other to destroy the masts in a Stop 5G Facebook group. Interesting how this article treats the government as the ultimate authority on all truth when they utterly failed to deal with this situation in any sort of coherent manner. And look, I have no idea if 5G helps spread viruses or whatever, but I have no problem with people destroying these towers. There were already questions about the health impact this technology may have on people outside of the coronavirus and it is pretty obvious that they have not been fully vetted. If people are destroying them out of fear of viruses, then so be it. Doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings. And besides, this is going to be one of the least weird things we‚Äôll see happen as this whole global doomsday virus situation develops."
Trump Says He Won‚Äôt Wear a Mask,1124,"Donald Trump the President of the United States of America has said that he is not going to wear a mask despite his administration recommending that Americans wear one to stop the spread of the doomsday virus. DNYUZ: Rarely has the schism between President Trump and his own public health advisers over the coronavirus pandemic been put on display quite so starkly. Even as he announced a new federal recommendation on Friday that Americans wear masks when out in public, he immediately disavowed it: ‚ÄúI am choosing not to do it.‚Äù The striking dichotomy underscored how often Mr. Trump has been at odds with the medical experts seeking to guide his handling of the outbreak as well as some of the governors fighting it on the front lines, despite his move to extend social distancing guidelines through April 30 and his acknowledgment that the death toll could be staggering. This is a missed opportunity by Trump. He should reconsider this decision and wear a mask during every public appearance he makes simply because of how funny it would be. I would especially like him to wear a Bane mask as that would be extra funny."
TOTAL DOOM: COVID-19 Spreads by Talking and Breathing!!,1622,"The doom and fear being spread in the Jew-run media about this alleged doomsday virus is getting difficult to comprehend. The Jew Elizabeth Cohen writing for the Jewish propaganda network of CNN, wrote an article describing how so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù were saying that COVID-19 can spread by just talking or breathing. This article was obviously meant to scare people. What other purpose is there in publishing such a headline in the midst of a mass hysteria? It‚Äôs like shouting fire in a crowded room. And guess who was quoted representing the so-called ‚Äúexperts.‚Äù CNN: A prestigious scientific panel told the White House Wednesday night that research shows coronavirus can be spread not just by sneezes or coughs, but also just by talking, or possibly even just breathing. ‚ÄúWhile the current [coronavirus] specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing,‚Äù according to the letter, written by Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of a committee with the National Academy of Sciences. Fineberg told CNN that he will wear start wearing a mask when he goes to the grocery store. Harvey Fineberg a Jew is making these statements. And as you can see he has a very trustworthy face. I blame Jews for the vast majority of the fear and hysteria that is out about the coronavirus largely because they‚Äôre the ones who control the largest media and social media outlets. Regardless of if this hysteria is part of a conspiracy or they themselves legitimately believe the madness they are publishing doesn‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôre still accountable for what they publish."
Trump Under Pressure to Call for a Nationwide Lockdown,1541,"The media and other political actors are trying to pressure the orange man into calling for a nationwide lockdown. The Hill: President Trump is holding back on declaring a nationwide stay-at-home order, even as some governors resist imposing restrictions that Trump‚Äôs top public health officials say are needed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The president has been reluctant to wade into matters he argues are better left to governors. But the pressure is growing for Trump to be decisive as Republican-led states like Texas, Iowa and Missouri are among the final holdouts to issue stay-at-home directives. Lawrence Gostin, director of the O‚ÄôNeill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said Trump may not have the legal authority to halt interstate travel or require governors to lock down a state. But the president has yet to fully use the power of his bully pulpit to encourage them to do so. It doesn‚Äôt even matter what he does or doesn‚Äôt do at this point. All the major states and the vast majority of the population has already been subjected to some type of lockdown order. The economic damage from this prolonged closure of vast portions of the American economy is already done. But what the lockdown is doing is preventing people from seeing just how bad the economic damage really is. It will be impossible to mask this reality forever though. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long they try to keep these insane measures in place. We are heading into a major economic crisis. There is no denying this."
"US Could See Up to 240,000 COVID-19 Deaths",1794,"I was promised an apocalypse and this is not that. AP: President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned Americans to brace for a ‚Äúhell of a bad two weeks‚Äù ahead as the White House projected there could be 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus pandemic even if current social distancing guidelines are maintained. Public health officials stressed that the number could be less if people across the country bear down on keeping their distance from one another. ‚ÄúWe really believe we can do a lot better than that,‚Äù said Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force. That would require all Americans to take seriously their role in preventing the spread of disease, she said. So we are now being told that 240,000 people could die from this alleged doomsday virus and that is a worst case estimate being given to us by the government. In all likelihood, we will see far fewer deaths than that. Last year 38,800 people died from car accidents. That number is not that far off from the numbers of deaths that we are told is going to result from this virus. And many of these people who are dying from this would have likely died from something else if not from this. Most of those who are dying are old people and people with pre-existing conditions. Sure, there are exceptions but those are the people who are primarily dying from it. I‚Äôm convinced more than ever that this could have been handled without shutting down the entire economy, but politicians and decision makers were gripped with fear and mass hysteria. I believe that when all is said and done, the countries that didn‚Äôt implement draconian lockdowns like Sweden and Belarus won‚Äôt fare any worse than the countries that destroyed their economies out of fear of this alleged doomsday virus."
America To Be Closed All April Over Virus Hysteria,1471,"As most of you are already aware, it looks like America is going to be closed for business all April and possibly beyond that in many parts of the country. Al Jazeera: Donald Trump extended federal guidelines on social distancing for another 30 days after a top public health expert warned deaths from the coronavirus could reach as many as 200,000 in the US. ‚ÄúThe modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. So I‚Äôll say it again, the peak, the highest point of death rates, remember, this is likely to hit in two weeks. Therefore, the next two weeks and during this period it‚Äôs very important that every one strongly follow the guidelines,‚Äù Trump told reporters. ‚ÄúThe better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end. Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread.‚Äù Most states have issued orders for people to lock themselves in their homes to avoid spreading the doomsday virus. There‚Äôs no avoiding a depression if the country is going to be immobilized for this amount of time. All this to save a handful of old and fat people who would have probably died from something else if not this. It is obviously a very stupid situation. On the bright side, if there are no jobs and a depression, this gives the third world little incentive to come here. There will also be fewer people bitching about gender pronouns and other retarded faggoty shit since they‚Äôll be too busy looking for food to eat."
Hospitals are Firing Doctors Who Talk to the Press,2030,"Hospitals are literally firing doctors who talk to the press. Bloomberg: Hospitals are threatening to fire health-care workers who publicise their working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äì and have in some cases followed through. Ming Lin, an emergency room physician in Washington state, said he was told Friday he was out of a job because he‚Äôd given an interview to a newspaper about a Facebook post detailing what he believed to be inadequate protective equipment and testing. In Chicago, a nurse was fired after emailing colleagues that she wanted to wear a more protective mask while on duty. In New York, the NYU Langone Health system has warned employees they could be terminated if they talk to the media without authorisation. ‚ÄúHospitals are muzzling nurses and other health-care workers in an attempt to preserve their image,‚Äù said Ruth Schubert, a spokesperson for the Washington State Nurses Association. ‚ÄúIt is outrageous.‚Äù Hospitals have traditionally had strict media guidelines to protect patient privacy, urging staff to talk with journalists only through official public relations offices. But the pandemic has ushered in a new era, Schubert said. Health-care workers ‚Äúmust have the ability to tell the public what is really going on inside the facilities where they are caring for Covid-19 patients,‚Äù she said. Clearly, medical personnel are being told that they will be fired if they talk to the media about what is going on in these hospitals. This makes me wonder what these doctors would tell us about what‚Äôs really going on in these facilities if they were allowed to talk with the media. The issue regarding personal protective equipment is one thing, but maybe they‚Äôd tell us that this doomsday virus isn‚Äôt as bad as we are being told. Maybe the real reason they‚Äôre being gagged is because the entire public health situation is being grossly exaggerated. Either way, the lack of transparency reinforces my belief that the government response we are witnessing is totally hysterical and insane."
‚ÄúDomestic Abuse‚Äù Cases Rise Because of Virus Lockdown,1645,"As a result of the virus lockdown, many women are finally getting the beatings that they‚Äôve so richly deserved. This is happening in many parts of the world. France is just one example. Reuters: France said on Monday it would pay for hotel rooms for victims of domestic violence and open pop-up counseling centers after figures showed the number of abuse cases had soared during the first week of a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said about 20 centers would open in stores around the country so women could drop in for help while getting groceries. The government also announced an extra one million euro ($1.1 million) for anti-domestic abuse organizations to help them respond to increased demand for services. The initiatives were launched after the government late last week said reports of domestic abuse to police had jumped 36% in Paris and 32% elsewhere in France after the restrictions came into force. The cases included two murders. Gender equality minister? Well, if genders are equal, women should have no fear of being beaten by a man because of equality. So I don‚Äôt understand why such a government position exists. It is worth noting that when a man ends up beating their wife or girlfriend, it is almost always because the woman did something to deserve it. And when you have a situation where men can‚Äôt get away from a nagging and manipulative cunt, the chances of them snapping and beating the shit out of them greatly increases. I predict that many women will get the shit beat out of them as this lockdown continues. And the vast majority of them will have deserved it."
Twitter Removes Bolsonaro Tweets Questioning Virus Hysteria,2669,"Twitter is now going so far as to remove tweets from the leader of a major country because he dared question all of this insane virus hysteria. AFP: Two tweets by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro in which he questioned quarantine measures aimed at containing the novel coronavirus were removed Sunday, on the grounds that they violated the social network‚Äôs rules. The far-right leader had posted several videos in which he flouted his government‚Äôs social distancing guidelines by mixing with supporters on the streets of Brasilia and urging them to keep the economy going. Two of the posts were removed and replaced with a notice explaining why they had been taken down. Twitter explained in a statement that it had recently expanded its global rules on managing content that contradicted public health information from official sources and could put people at greater risk of transmitting COVID-19. ‚ÄúOfficial sources‚Äù they say. Well who do they define as an ‚Äúofficial source‚Äù exactly? Bolsonaro is the leader of Brazil a major country with many millions of people. He is by definition an ‚Äúofficial source.‚Äù In one of the deleted videos, Bolsonaro tells a street vendor, ‚ÄúWhat I have been hearing from people is that they want to work.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I have said from the beginning is that ‚Äòwe are going to be careful, the over-65s stay at home,'‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe just can‚Äôt stand still, there is fear because if you don‚Äôt die of the disease, you starve,‚Äù the vendor is seen telling Bolsonaro, who responds: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to die!‚Äù In another video, the president calls for a ‚Äúreturn to normality,‚Äù questioning quarantine measures imposed by governors and some mayors across the giant South American country as an effective containment measure against the virus. ‚ÄúIf it continues like this, with the amount of unemployment what we will have later is a very serious problem that will take years to be resolved,‚Äù he said of the isolation measures. ‚ÄúBrazil cannot stop or we‚Äôll turn into Venezuela,‚Äù Bolsonaro later told reporters outside his official residence. Bolsonaro is right about the hysteria. Shutting down everything is in the process of creating all sorts of economic and societal disasters around the world. This is going to prove to be a far bigger problem than the virus itself. But what‚Äôs really insane is how all this hysteria is being enforced by social media companies like Twitter. If a major world leader can‚Äôt speak freely about a subject without having his posts deleted, than who can? This is the end result of Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to do anything about these social media monopolies. Free speech on the Internet does not exist because of this situation."
UK Could Stay Closed Another Three to Six Months!,3544,"Out of all countries in the West, the United Kingdom has reacted among the most hysterically to the coronavirus. They‚Äôre now saying that everyone in the country might need to stay locked in their home for the next three to six months! The Sun: THE UK‚Äôs coronavirus restrictions could last for six months, the deputy chief medical officer warned today. Dr Jenny Harries refused to rule out extending the lockdown, and suggested the restrictions would depend on the peak of the virus. Speaking at today‚Äôs press conference, the medical expert explained the restrictions would be guided by the infection rate. She said: ‚ÄúThe issue of the three weeks is for us to review where we are and see if we‚Äôve had an impact jointly on the slope of that curve. ‚ÄúBut I think to make it clear to the public if we are successful we will have squashed the top of that curve, which is brilliant, but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living that would be quite dangerous. ‚ÄúIf we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak. ‚ÄúSo over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review. ‚ÄúWe may see measures of lockdown going forward over the next six months, that would not be an implausible outcome.‚Äù Dr Harries explained there would be a review of the lockdown in three weeks, a review of the curve in two to three months, then one of the social distancing measures in up to half a year. Meanwhile Boris Johnson is running the country from some remote command bunker somewhere after catching the infection. He‚Äôs claiming that they might have to impose even tighter restrictions! BBC: The prime minister has warned that the coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets better, in a letter being sent to every UK household. Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, says stricter restrictions could be put in place if necessary. Britons will also get a leaflet detailing government rules on leaving the house and health information. It follows criticism over the clarity of government advice to date. The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019, with a further 260 deaths announced on Saturday. There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. In the letter being sent to 30 million households at an anticipated cost of ¬£5.8m, Mr Johnson writes: ‚ÄúFrom the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. ‚ÄúWe will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do.‚Äù How much more stricter could they possibly get? They‚Äôve already issued some of the most extreme lockdown measures imaginable and threatened people with arrest if they defy government edicts. The only way they could get tougher is by putting people in camps or just shooting people who defy their orders. But hell, British police are already deploying drones to track and shame people who defy government orders for not buying into the mass hysteria they‚Äôre promoting. They are literally using drones to spy on people who dare walk their dog or hike on a trail. These activities have all been declared non essential by the government. Lawyers say 'overzealous' police forces are breaking law by chasing ramblers with drones https://t.co/r4xdsO0WZe ‚Äî Daily Mail U.K. (@DailyMailUK) March 27, 2020 So with this in mind, why wouldn‚Äôt they issue an order to have people shot for defying the government? It actually isn‚Äôt that much more insane than what they‚Äôre already doing."
California: Child Murderers Released Because of Coronavirus,2700,"California Governor Gavin Newsom has just released a number of murderers including some child murderers because of the coronavirus. AP: California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday pardoned five people who already served their time and commuted the sentences of 21 state prison inmates, including more than a dozen convicted of murder or related crimes. The victims were children in two of the cases and a pregnant woman in a third. The clemency requests were being considered before the coronavirus crisis, ‚Äúand, as resources permitted, the governor decided to move forward with them,‚Äù spokeswoman Vicky Waters said in an email. Attorneys representing inmates this week asked federal judges to free thousands of inmates to help prisons better confront the pandemic, which has sickened one inmate and 12 employees. Newsom said mass inmate releases would further burden strained community health care systems and homelessness programs. But he stopped transfers into the system for 30 days. The crisis affected his clemency decisions, Waters said. This is just madness. There is no evidence indicating that we are in a doomsday apocalypse situation and thus no reason to release child murderers because of it. And even if we were in a doomsday apocalypse situation, there would still be no reason to release child murderers. And as Newsom is releasing child murderers on to the streets, the Los Angeles County Sheriff has made the unconstitutional and illegal decision to have gun stores closed. A matter which he and the governor are being sued over. LA Times: A coalition of gun owner groups filed a federal lawsuit Friday against the Los Angeles County Sheriff, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state and county health officials seeking to block the closure of gun shops during the coronavirus shutdown. Sheriff Alex Villaneuva closed gun stores in L.A. County Thursday to everyone except police and licensed security company employees after the governor deemed that firearms sellers are considered nonessential businesses during California‚Äôs shutdown of commerce in an effort to limit and slow the spread of the coronavirus. Villanueva took the action after county lawyers early this week had stalled an effort to close the gun stores. Then Newsom gave the OK for Villaneuva to decide what happened to local gun stores in the county during the ordered statewide stay-at-home order. So as the California government is releasing child murderers, they are simultaneously saying that you as a law abiding citizen, do not have the right to buy a firearm to defend yourself from the child murderers that they are releasing. It is becoming increasingly difficult for me to use words to express just how insane all this is."
India: People Who Leave Their Homes Could Be Shot,1794,"The mass hysteria that has gripped the West over the coronavirus has gripped India. India‚Äôs entire population of 1.3 billion has been banned from leaving their homes and government officials have threatened to shoot those who defy the ban. Daily Mail: Indians have been warned they could be shot if they defy the coronavirus lockdown with thousands queuing for food today despite social distancing advice. Three more people died overnight as the health ministry said the number of cases had risen to 649, including 13 dead. But despite the populace of 1.3billion being told to stay indoors by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, thousands were seen lining up close behind each other to get into bustling markets in Delhi, Kolkota and Mumbai on Thursday. Yesterday there were chaotic scenes across the nation with police beating violators of the lockdown with rattan canes and forcing others to crouch down in chalk circles to teach them about social distancing. In the southern state of Telangana the chief minister, Kalvakuntla Chandrashekhar, made the most ruthless threat to anyone who continues to flout the rules. ‚ÄòPlease don‚Äôt let it come to this,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThe administration cannot stop everyone and I will have to call in the army or issue ‚Äòshoot at sight‚Äô orders. Please stay at home.‚Äô This is insanity. They‚Äôre ordering 1.3 billion people not to leave their homes when only 19 people in the entire country are believed to have died from it. The entire world has gone mad. This is a mass overreaction to something that has already proven to not be all that deadly. In fact it might be less deadly than originally thought due to lack of available testing kits. At worst, it is only slightly more deadlier than the flu and that might not even be true considering we don‚Äôt have complete data."
South Africa Does Full Military Lockdown of the Country Over COVID-19,2310,"The nigger occupational government of South Africa has announced a full military lockdown of the country because of the endless coronavirus hysteria. BBC: ‚ÄúThe night Cyril Ramaphosa became a wartime president‚Äù is how a leading columnist for South Africa‚Äôs News24 website described the South African leader‚Äôs decision to impose a nationwide lockdown to defeat coronavirus. The three-week lockdown, which started just after midnight, is unprecedented. It is the first time since South Africa became a democracy in 1994 that a president had stripped away the most basic freedoms of citizens ‚Äì to walk, to shop, to socialise and to congregate for prayer without hindrance. ‚ÄúThe law is that you stay at home. The exception is for survival: food [and] health, with security forces making sure that the law is enforced,‚Äù government minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said. Now some of the hard-won freedoms that South Africans attained after defeating apartheid have been temporarily lost a mere 25 years later as they ‚Äì like many other nations in the world ‚Äì cede their rights to governments to fight what Mr Ramaphosa and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called an ‚Äúinvisible enemy‚Äù. The government has even banned the sale of alcohol and cigarettes, as well as jogging or walking dogs, during the lockdown ‚Äì warning that offenders risked being prosecuted, and either fined or jailed. Such restrictions on civil liberties were not even imposed by the apartheid regime during its almost five decade-long oppressive rule. This is one of the most draconian lockdowns anywhere in the world. Banning walking dogs is particularly crazy. But being that the South African government is run by a bunch of low IQ niggers, it is not surprising for them to overreact like this. So far South Africa only has two coronavirus related deaths which makes this type of lockdown seem particularly crazy. South Africa has its first two deaths from coronavirus in Western Cape. Tune in on #DStv403 and https://t.co/srSwp4H5Hm for more on this breaking news story. pic.twitter.com/L849dMPZFQ ‚Äî eNCA (@eNCA) March 27, 2020 Trying to force a large number of violent niggers to stay at home is going to be quite the challenge. Best of luck to them though. They will likely find that the lockdown will cause worse problems than the virus."
Boris Johnson Tests Positve for Chink Virus,1776,"Another famous person has caught the chink virus aka bat soup virus. This time it is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Daily Mail: Boris Johnson has been in close contact with dozens of politicians and health chiefs over the past ten days before testing positive for coronavirus. The Prime Minister has been holding press conferences at 10 Downing Street with the likes of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. He has also stood near Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries, Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance. The three scientists have appeared at the Downing Street press conferences, and have also been meeting other politicians and civil servants across Westminster. While the PM has held Cabinet meetings and discussions with the Queen remotely, he still attended the Commons for Prime Minister‚Äôs Questions on Wednesday. The reason why so many famous people are allegedly coming down with the virus is because they seem to be the only ones who readily have access to tests. The only other alternative explanation to this is that they are lying about having it to promote mass hysteria. While not impossible, it seems unlikely that all these famous people would get together and conspire to lie about being infected. But here‚Äôs the deal, considering there is still limited testing available, and we haven‚Äôt seen mass apocalypse level deaths, it is very possible that lots of people have it and don‚Äôt know they have it. I believe this is a problem, but we aren‚Äôt talking about doomsday-tier stuff that‚Äôs going on. And once again, I‚Äôm speaking as a hateful asshole who would love to see billions of people die from the coronavirus. I‚Äôm just not seeing that as being the final outcome."
New York Has Roughly Half the COVID-19 Cases in the US,4116,"Even though I firmly believe that the coronavirus is a totally overhyped problem, it is still a problem. New York State and in particular New York City has been hit quite hard. They currently have roughly half of all coronavirus cases in the country. CNN: There were over 74,000 cases of coronavirus in the United States as of Thursday midday. About half were in New York ‚Äî almost 10 times more than any other state. Why has the outbreak hit New York so much harder than other places? Health experts said the answers are largely specific to the New York metropolitan area ‚Äî its density and population, primarily ‚Äî but they are also a warning to other states that think they may be spared. New York is the epicenter for now, but Covid-19 will not stop there. The latest numbers show that New York has by far the most coronavirus cases. Far more than any other state. New Jersey has the second highest number of cases and they are geographically located right next to New York. So why does New York have so many cases? Well, it is worth mentioning that New York and New York City in particular has a very large population of Jews. Thanks to the work of prominent German politicians like Adolf Hitler, we know that Jews are a filthy race of people who live in filthy dwellings. Just look at these Jews. As we can see by the below picture, they are a disgusting and demonic race of rats who originate from the pits of hell. Considering how dirty and disgusting these Jews are, would it not be safe to assume that their filthy dwellings and poor hygiene played a major role in helping spread COVID-19? In my view, this is something that should be immediately investigated by the federal government. The Jewish problem aside, New York‚Äôs politicians were of no help. They were claiming that people who had questions about the coronavirus were racists. A point of which Tucker Carlson recently covered on his cable news show. Tucker Carlson rips into the leaders of New York City, who ""not only failed to shield their citizens from [coronavirus] but took affirmative and aggressive steps to increase the risks to their population."" pic.twitter.com/x67hk4m9BX ‚Äî Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 27, 2020 And just a few weeks ago, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio was telling people to go out on the town even as it was becoming apparent that the coronavirus was going to be an issue. Nearly half of the coronavirus cases in the US are in New York. Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio was telling New Yorkers to ""go on with your lives"" and ""get out on the town"" in MARCH as the virus was spreading. He‚Äôs now been trying to blame Trump for the crisis NY is facing. Insane. pic.twitter.com/kLWuTXfKNH ‚Äî Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) March 26, 2020 But maybe we should thank De Blasio and these other politicians. Their retarded handling of the situation resulted in the death of this Holocaust hoaxing kike. New York City Rabbi Avraham Hakohen ""Romi"" Cohn, who survived the Holocaust and saved dozens of families from the genocide, has died of complications from coronavirus, a family member said. He was 91. https://t.co/JPkjW6Q0mN ‚Äî CNN (@CNN) March 26, 2020 It‚Äôs also likely that other Holocaust hoaxing kikes will die from the coronavirus and that is a very good thing. In fact, maybe De Blasio and these other politicians intentionally said and did the dumbest things imaginable because they wanted the coronavirus to kill all the Jews that live in New York City. But let‚Äôs be clear. The fact that the biggest problem with the coronavirus is in an area where lots of Jews live is a link that absolutely needs to be looked into. If there is a link, and I fully suspect that there is, we need to immediately round up all Jews and put them in FEMA camps. High quality FEMA camps with very large shower rooms so they can be cleaned and less likely to spread this horrible infection. It is a sacrifice these Jews must make if America is to survive into the future. And considering that Jews claim they are loyal to America before any other country, I have no doubt that these Jews would be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice."
US Unemployment Claims Skyrocket to 3.3 Million,1328,"As expected, a historical number of unemployment claims were filed this past week. Mercury News: Nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week ‚Äî more than quadruple the previous record, in 1982 ‚Äî amid a widespread economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus. ‚Ä¶ California Gov. Gavin Newsom estimated on Wednesday that the state has received 1 million jobless claims over a period of about two weeks since March 13, an indication that the ongoing weekly totals are likely to spike even higher. This is a direct result of the government claiming that we have to shut down the entire economy over an infection that has only killed 1,000 people in the whole country. They could have merely warned old people and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid contact with people until this was over while letting healthy people work. But no, they claimed everything had to be shut down. Donald Trump could have banned air travel to China far earlier and not ordered insane evacuation missions to fly Americans out of areas quarantined by the Chinese. The government pretty much did everything wrong every step of the way and that‚Äôs why we are in this current situation. It‚Äôs likely to get much worse too. Expect to see an increase in suicides and all sorts of other crazy shit happen the longer this goes on."
"Coronavirus Hysteria Continues Despite Only 1,000 Deaths in US",3287,"Despite continued claims by the Jewish media, the coronavirus situation is not the apocalyptic doomsday scenario they are claiming it to be. So far, coronavirus deaths in the United States have only reached 1,000. NBC News: The United States has reached a grim milestone as the number of deaths linked to coronavirus passed 1,000 in the country on Thursday, according to a count by NBC News. The number of reported deaths associated with the disease in the U.S. was at least 1,001 as of Thursday morning, according to that count, and there have been more than 68,000 reported cases. Globally, reported deaths passed 21,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The university puts the U.S. death toll even higher than the NBC News count, listing 1,050 as of around 2:30 a.m. ET. Deaths continued to rise in New York, which has been called the epicenter of the epidemic on the U.S. There have been at least 334 deaths linked to the illness caused by the novel coronavirus as of early Thursday. The vast majority of people who get infected don‚Äôt die from it. The people who do die from it are with a few exceptions either elderly or individuals with pre-existing conditions. Regardless, we are seeing wild claims about how we are in the midst of an apocalypse when it is obvious that we are not. The data is not backing this up and I‚Äôm speaking as someone who has taken a pro-apocalypse position. I absolutely want to see billions of people die, largely because I think it would be very funny to see billions of people die. But from an infection standpoint this is just not happening. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 23,000 people in the United States are estimated to have died from the flu this season. The 2017-2018 flu season was much deadlier than this current flu season and there was nobody saying that we were in the middle of an apocalypse when that was happening. Health.com: So how do these numbers compare to flu deaths in previous years? So far, it looks like the 2019-2020 death toll won‚Äôt be as high as it was in the 2017-2018 season, when 61,000 deaths were linked to the virus. However, it could equal or surpass the 2018-2019 season‚Äôs 34,200 flu-related deaths. Overall, the CDC estimates that 12,000 and 61,000 deaths annually since 2010 can be blamed on the flu. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the flu kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year. But yet the kikes in the media are promoting this doomsday bullshit when only 1,000 people in the entire country have died from it. The homosexual Jew Matt Drudge is promoting the same doomsday nonsense on his website. His main headline links to an article projecting that 80,000 Americans could die from the coronavirus over the next four months. Even if we assume that this projection is true, 80,000 deaths is not that far off from the 61,000 that died during the 2017-2018 flu season. So this projection which Drudge is promoting as a ‚Äúshock claim‚Äù is not doomsday-tier. The main point is that this situation is being exaggerated as an excuse to shut down the economy and implement all sorts of bullshit dystopic agendas. The main problem is not the infection, it is the hysterical reaction to it. That‚Äôs going to be far more problematic than the virus itself."
Prince Charles Tests Positive for Coronavirus,1612,"Prince Charles has allegedly caught the coronavirus. The Sun: Camilla, 72, tested negative for the virus, with the couple now self-isolating at their home in Balmoral, Scotland. It is believed he suffered mild symptoms over the weekend while at Highgrove House in Gloucester and flew privately to Scotland on Sunday night where he was tested on Monday. It is understood he is in good spirits and remains up and about. Buckingham Palace has since confirmed the Queen remains in ‚Äúgood health‚Äù after heading to Windsor last Thursday with Prince Philip a week earlier than planned. Charles most recently saw the Queen ‚Äúbriefly‚Äù on March 12. Medical experts believe the earliest Charles would have been contagious was March 13. Charles has also spoken to both of his sons, Prince William, 37, in Norfolk and Prince Harry, 35, in Canada after the news. Confirming the news today, Clarence House said: ‚ÄúThe Prince of Wales has tested positive for Coronavirus. ‚ÄúHe has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.‚Äù Another six members of staff now isolating with them. This is great news. Hopefully he dies from it. This asshole was flying around on private jets while lecturing everybody about how we were destroying the planet from fossil fuel emissions. Many believe that he plotted with British Intelligence to have his ex-wife Princess Diana murdered in that car crash incident back in the 1990s. Those people are probably correct. Either way, Prince Charles is an asshole and the world would be better off if he were dead."
India Locks Down Entire Country,955,"The Indian government has announced a total lockdown of their country for 21 days because of the coronavirus. AP: India will begin the world‚Äôs largest lockdown on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in a TV address, warning citizens to stay inside or risk inviting the pandemic into their homes, and pledging $2 billion to bolster the country‚Äôs beleaguered health care system. ‚ÄúTo save India and every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out,‚Äù Modi said Tuesday night, acknowledging that the 21-day lockdown would be a major blow to the economy, but insisting that the alternative could set the country back 21 years. The move puts nearly one-fifth of the world‚Äôs population under lockdown. These extreme measures were totally unnecessary. All they had to do was let Indians drink cow urine and eat cow dung. These substances are widely believed by their people to have many benefits including the ability to kill the coronavirus."
Britain Tells Hoarders to Stop Hoarding,1910,"The British government is telling hoarders to stop hoarding after the government ordered a total shut down of the country. The hoarding problem was further highlighted after a nurse posted a video of herself in tears after her shift and finding bare store shelves. Her video has generated a fair amount of media attention. Reuters: Britain on Saturday told people who were panic-buying and hoarding food due to the coronavirus outbreak to calm down, pointing to a video on social media showing an exhausted nurse driven to tears by finding shelves bare after her shift. Shoppers have been emptying the shelves in many supermarkets over the past week, with some wrestling over toilet roll and others hoarding everything from pasta to frozen peas as the government told people to stay home and avoid contact. A billion pounds ($1.2 billion) of extra food have been squirreled away over the past three weeks, putting massive pressure on supermarkets, environment and food minister George Eustice said. At a news briefing, he urged people to ‚Äúbe responsible when you shop and think of others‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere is more than enough food to go round and our food supply chain is able to expand production to cope with increased demand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBuying more than you need means that others may be left without, and it is making life more difficult for those front-line workers such as our doctors and nurses and NHS (National Health Service) support staff.‚Äù The only way you‚Äôll stop this problem is by rationing and threatening to shoot the people who are hoarding product. The United Kingdom like the United States is not a cohesive society thanks to Jewish-enforced multiculturalism, so the hoarding problem will definitely continue unless draconian measures are taken. People simply do not give a shit about one another in a multicultural system and we are seeing this come to the surface now that shit is hitting the fan."
Coronavirus Hysteria Used to Bash Paper Currency,1596,"This insane hysteria surrounding the coronavirus is resulting in all sorts of ridiculous agendas being pushed. The bashing of paper currency is one of those agendas. CBS News: A growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over its lifetime, could be a vector for the coronavirus. Public officials and health experts have said the risk of transferring the virus person-to-person through the use of banknotes is low, but they don‚Äôt rule it out. Dr. Sanjay Maggirwar, chair of the George Washington University School of Medicine‚Äôs department of microbiology, immunology and tropical medicine, recently told CBS MoneyWatch that researchers think coronaviruses ‚Äúcan stay on surfaces in their fully active states for at least 10 days. That includes cash and all kinds of other surfaces that people normally touch. So certainly with the coronavirus, cash handling is a concern.‚Äù Some businesses are refusing to accept currency, with while several countries have urged their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether. They‚Äôre basically claiming that using paper currency could potentially result in you getting infected with the coronavirus plague and that you should opt to stop using it altogether. Simply put, the Jews want to get rid of cash altogether. This way all transactions can be tracked and traced. The next step after implementing a cashless society, will be forcing you to get a microchip implant in order to buy and sell. This was famously predicted in the Book of Revelation."
Democrats Implementing Draconian COVID-19 Lockdowns,1569,"Democrats have interestingly enough been implementing the most severe and draconian lockdowns as a result of this COVID-19 situation. California, New York, Illinois and Connecticut all of which have Democrat governors, have so far instituted the most severe lockdowns. Connecticut, New York and Illinois have joined California in ordering all nonessential workers to remain at home to slow the spread of coronavirus, which means 1 in 5 Americans live in a state under general stay-at-home order. https://t.co/F5U2hvt1sA pic.twitter.com/7FX2qMLS24 ‚Äî OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) March 20, 2020 In Arizona, the skank Democrat mayor of Phoenix pushed to implement major restrictions on the city as the Republican governor instituted much more moderate restrictions across the state.

And what is this all about? Because of a virus that has killed less people globally than the flu has in the United States? Sure, this is a problem, but the hysteria surrounding it is totally unjustified. I do not believe they are doing any of this to protect the public‚Äôs health, I believe they are instead using this situation as an excuse to inflict as much economic pain as possible. The more economic pain there is, the better chances they have at defeating the orange man in November."
"Global Coronavirus Deaths Reach 11,000",1594,"Even though I had hoped that the coronavirus was going to result in millions if not billions of people dying, that has so far not proven to be the case. The death total has only reached 11,000 across the world. Al Jazeera: The death toll from the new coronavirus has surpassed 5,000 in Europe, with Italy, Spain and Germany reporting a steep rise in infections. Worldwide deaths surged past 11,000 on Saturday, according to data collected by the Johns Hopkins University in the United States. More than 277,000 people have been infected, while some 88,000 have recovered. It is interesting to note that 23,000 people in the United States alone have died from the flu according to estimates from the government. That‚Äôs more than twice the number of people who have died around the world from the coronavirus. Yet despite the flu being much more of a problem, we saw no calls to lock down entire countries to battle its spread. Plus, most of the people dying from the coronavirus are old people or those with pre-existing health conditions. If they didn‚Äôt die from the coronavirus, they would have probably died soon from something else. I do believe that the coronavirus is a legitimate problem, but I believe that the extent of the problem is being grossly exaggerated. Unfortunately, the overreaction to it has triggered events which threaten to destroy the entire global economy. And if we are to be honest, this was probably all part of a plan to justify the implementation of all sorts of insane agendas. Even if it wasn‚Äôt, it provides a convenient excuse to implement these insane agendas."
Twitter Bans Free Speech On The Coronavirus,1173,"Look at this bullshit. Twitter is going to remove any posts on their site that don‚Äôt fall in line with the official coronavirus narratives put about by the World Health Organization and other government organizations. Content that increases the chance that someone contracts or transmits the virus, including:
‚Äì Denial of expert guidance
‚Äì Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques
‚Äì Misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities ‚Äî Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) March 18, 2020 Denial of ‚Äúexpert‚Äù guidance they say. Well, who is considered an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù? Seems like the so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù did a pretty shitty job handling this situation. These supposed ‚Äúexperts‚Äù failed to stop the spread and now we are in the midst of a biological apocalypse. Millions of people are going to die because of these incompetent assholes. Alex Jones has more credibility on the issue, and he should be allowed to promote his coronavirus toothpaste cure. If it doesn‚Äôt actually cure the coronavirus, people can give the product one star reviews on Yelp. It is as simple as that. There is no need for all his crazy censorship."
56 Percent of California Projected to Get COVID-19,1402,"The California state government is projecting that over half the state‚Äôs residents are going to get infected with COVID-19 over the next two months. Whoa‚Äî In his letter to the President, Governor Gavin Newsom warns the state projects roughly 56% of California‚Äôs population will be infected with the virus over an 8 week period. That‚Äôs 25.5 million people. pic.twitter.com/Qf8kIOi6JS ‚Äî Ashley Zavala (@ZavalaA) March 19, 2020 The Hill: California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a letter to the Trump administration that 56 percent of the state‚Äôs population ‚Äî 25.5 million people ‚Äî is projected to be infected with the coronavirus over an eight-week period. In the letter, Newsom asked President Trump to deploy the USNS Mercy hospital ship to the port of Los Angeles until September of this year ‚Äúto help decompress our current healthcare delivery system in the Los Angeles region in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.‚Äù Jesse Melgar, a spokesman for the governor, specified that the estimate was without mitigating factors. That‚Äôs a pretty dire projection. All countermeasures have been too little, too late. California is in a particularly bad spot considering all of the homeless people they have shitting everywhere. The whole state is going to look like a scene from the movie Escape from L.A.. The only difference from the movie is that nobody is going to get out alive and everyone is going to die."
Feds Setting Up Cell Phone Tracking Grid to Fight COVID-19,2734,"The United States government is reportedly using the coronavirus situation to justify setting up a cell phone tracking grid. The Hill: The federal government is in talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies about ways to use smartphone location data to tackle the coronavirus, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. Washington is reportedly interested in using the data to better understand how the virus spreads and to see whether people are practicing social distancing. A new task force made up of tech and other industry executives presented ideas for the use of the location data at a White House meeting Sunday, the Post reported. Presenters included officials from Harvard University and representatives from top tech groups and Silicon Valley firms. The White House‚Äôs Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) did not immediately respond to The Hill‚Äôs request for comment. An unnamed OSTP official told The Washington Post that they were ‚Äúencouraged by American technology companies looking to leverage, aggregate, anonymized data to glean key insights for COVID-19 modeling efforts.‚Äù The meeting came on the heels of a summit led by U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios last week with federal agencies and executives from tech giants such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Amazon to hash out how Silicon Valley can help fight the spread of coronavirus. ‚ÄúThe White House‚Äôs top priority is ensuring the safety and health of the American people amid the COVID-19 outbreak,‚Äù Kratsios said in a statement following the meeting. ‚ÄúCutting edge technology companies and major online platforms will play a critical role in this all-hands-on-deck effort.‚Äù They are probably going to do this since Israel is already involved in a similar type of program. In Israel they are tracing cell phone data to identify, track and quarantine people who have contracted the coronavirus; and to identify others who should be quarantined because their paths crossed.https://t.co/jcFRa2OeY8#CoronavirusOutbreak ‚Äî PostSecret (@postsecret) March 17, 2020 This is obviously a bunch of bullshit. What freedoms do we have left in America? They‚Äôre going to use this coronavirus situation to enhance the already intrusive technological spy grid. We already know that the National Security Agency collects all this data and data mines it for nefarious unconstitutional purposes. That was all meant to be secret, but now they‚Äôre just openly announcing these types of programs and claiming that it is necessary to fight the coronavirus. The saying ‚Äúnever let a crisis go to waste‚Äù is basically what we are seeing with this. It‚Äôs like what they did after the 9/11 attacks with the Patriot Act and other freedom-destroying laws."
UK Government Document Says 80 Percent Could Get Infection,2613,"A secret British government document has painted a very grim picture about the ongoing coronavirus apocalypse. It says that 80 percent of the British population could get infected and that many millions of people will need to be hospitalized. Guardian: The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals. The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for another 12 months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS. It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time. Prof Chris Whitty, the government‚Äôs chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population ‚Äúare expected‚Äù to contract the virus. The document says that: ‚ÄúAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.‚Äù It is hard to see how the British hospital system would be able to handle this amount of infected people. Granted, these are just estimated projections, but I would believe these estimates over others since these figures were not meant for public consumption. They obviously didn‚Äôt want them published as the numbers are bad enough to cause a potential mass panic. The British are already looking at forcing anybody over the age of 70 into isolation.

Spain and France Announce Sweeping Travel Restrictions,1098,"Spain and France have announced sweeping domestic travel restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus. BBC: Two of the EU‚Äôs biggest states, Spain and France, have followed Italy in announcing emergency restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus. In Spain, people are banned from leaving home except for buying essential supplies and medicines, or for work. With 191 deaths, Spain is Europe‚Äôs worst-hit country after Italy. In France, where 91 people have died, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and most shops are now shut. Italy, which has recorded more than 1,440 deaths, began a nationwide lockdown on Monday. The World Health Organization (WHO) says Europe is now the ‚Äúepicentre‚Äù of the pandemic. WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged countries to use aggressive measures, community mobilisation and social distancing to save lives. This may again be a case of too little, too late. Italy‚Äôs hospital system has been overwhelmed and they locked down their entire country a week ago. We may see a similar situation unfold in both these countries despite the new restrictions."
Greece‚Äôs Female President Vows to Defend Borders Humanely,1700,"Greece has for some insane reason thought it would be a good idea to make a woman its president. This empowered female president is saying that she will defend the nation‚Äôs borders but do it in a way that respects human rights. AFP: Greece‚Äôs first woman president began her term on Friday with a pledge to protect the country‚Äôs borders and defend human rights, whilst warning Greeks to follow health rules as the country grapples with over 100 coronavirus cases. Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a 63-year-old former senior judge, said she would ‚Äúwalk together‚Äù with Greeks to create a ‚Äúprosperous‚Äù and ‚Äúcosmopolitan‚Äù future ‚Äúthat includes all of us.‚Äù The new head of the Greek state begins her five-year term in a terse standoff with neighbouring Turkey, which has allowed tens of thousands of refugees to mass at the border. Sakellaropoulou said Greeks had to ‚Äúrepulse the aggression of those who make designs on our national sovereignty by making use of human pain.‚Äù The new president also insisted that Greece had a ‚Äúhumanitarian duty‚Äù to defend ‚Äúdefenceless and desperate people. What sort of nonsense is this? There is only one way to defend a nation‚Äôs borders and that is with physical force. In more extreme situations, it is necessary to kill invaders who threaten the sovereignty of an individual country. Human rights do not factor into the equation. The fact that this old skank is even talking about human rights makes her vow to defend the nation‚Äôs borders highly questionable. Even though Greece‚Äôs presidency is largely a ceremonial position, it is utterly insane that a woman is allowed to hold it. Especially considering that the Turks are basically green lighting an invasion against them."
Merkel: 70% of Germany Could Get Infected With Coronavirus,1254,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel who for some reason is still in political power, came out and said that 70 percent of the German population could get infected with the coronavirus. BBC: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that up to 70% of the country‚Äôs population ‚Äì some 58 million people ‚Äì could contract the coronavirus. Mrs Merkel made the stark prediction at a news conference on Wednesday alongside Health Minister Jens Spahn. She said since there was no known cure, the focus would fall on slowing the spread of the virus. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about winning time,‚Äù she explained. Her remarks came as Italy entered its second day of a national lockdown. This type of rhetoric is extreme but it is even more extreme for a mainstream politician to say something like this. Saying that 70 percent of your population is going to catch the virus and that nothing can be done about it is a bit insane. It‚Äôs almost as if these people are trying to stir up fear intentionally. I truthfully don‚Äôt believe that the coronavirus is going to result in an apocalypse, I just hope it causes an apocalypse because I want to see billions of people die. Perhaps Merkel shares my view on wanting to see billions of people die and this is why she is stirring up all this fear."
21 of 45 on Coronaship are Infected,1334,"So nearly half the people on this coronavirus-infected ship off the coast of California has tested positive for the virus. As a result, the genius Vice President Mike Pence is allowing them to dock at a non-commercial port. Fox News: Vice President Mike Pence said a cruise ship being held off the coast of California will be directed to a non-commercial port so all crew and passengers can be tested, during a news conference Friday. Of the 46 people swab-tested on the Grand Princess so far, 21 tested positive for the virus and one was deemed inconclusive, Pence said. The rest tested negative for the disease. Nineteen of those who tested positive were crew members. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking all measures necessary to see to the health of the Americans on the Grand Princess and just as importantly to protect the health of the American public and prevent the spread of the disease,‚Äù Pence told reporters at the White House. ‚ÄúWe will be testing everyone on the ship. We will be quarantining.‚Äù This is completely nuts. Why not just destroy the ship with a drone strike? Or drop a bomb on it? Bringing them on land just risks the spread of infection. Although at this point it probably doesn‚Äôt matter since the coronavirus is already out in the wild now. People will just have to accept the fact that millions if not billions are going to die."
Coronavirus Infected Cruise Ship Denied Port in California,2344,"A cruise ship infected by the coronavirus has been denied port in California. USA Today: The World Health Organization declined to declare a pandemic and a cruise ship remained at arms length from San Francisco on Thursday as officials grappled with the coronavirus outbreak blamed for more than 3,300 deaths worldwide. The Grand Princess was denied port in California amid concerns its 3,500 passengers and crew may have been exposed to the coronavirus. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the ship was sailing with 62 passengers who had been on the ship‚Äôs previous voyage with a 71-year-old man who eventually died from the virus. The current cruise was scheduled to arrive in San Francisco on Wednesday but will not return to port until testing can take place, Newsom said. More than 20 passengers and crew members have developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Test kits were being flown onto the ship to test them and scores of others on board, the governor said. The man died in Placer County, near Sacramento, representing the first U.S. fatality outside of¬†Washington state, which has reported 10 deaths. More than 30 of the nation‚Äôs 165¬†confirmed coronavirus cases are in California.¬†California and Los Angeles declared states of emergency Wednesday; San Francisco issued its declaration a week ago. It‚Äôs actually funny that the entire west coast is having the most problems with the coronavirus. It is funny because there are many people on the west coast who I would love to see die of the coronavirus. I also find it funny that California‚Äôs Governor Gavin Newsom is denying entry to this cruise ship, leaving them to die at sea. This is also funny because anybody who willfully spends their money on a stupid cruise deserves to die just on basic principle. I‚Äôm just waiting for his Democrat friends to accuse him of being mean spirited and racist for not allowing the cruise ship to dock. And even though I don‚Äôt think the coronavirus will cause an apocalypse, I still am rooting for it to cause an apocalypse because an apocalypse would make life much more interesting. Plus, during an apocalypse, we won‚Äôt hear anyone bitching about gender pronouns and dumb annoying shit nobody cares about. So that‚Äôd be one positive right there. We have to understand that despite the negatives, an apocalypse would also provide many positives."
Italy: 50 Percent Increase in Coronavirus Cases in One Day,1586,"The coronavirus is spreading like wildfire in Italy. They experienced a significant increase in coronavirus cases over a single day. The Hill: Italian authorities said Sunday that the country has confirmed 1,694 cases of a potentially deadly coronavirus, representing a 50 percent increase in the last 24 hours alone. Officials added that five more people have died from the disease, bringing the total to 34 in the country, according to The Associated Press. Health officials reportedly noted that a marked increase in coronavirus cases was expected because it can take up to two weeks for containment measures to take effect and because of Italy‚Äôs sizable elderly population. Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Health Institute, said it would take up to 10 more days for the outbreak to become less severe. The announcement arrived following a week in which U.S. health officials warned that a coronavirus outbreak within the country‚Äôs border was likely inevitable and as the Trump administration created a task force designed to combat its spread. It‚Äôs hard to say how bad this is going to get, but I hope it gets worse and causes a total economic collapse around the world. The main reason why I want it to get worse is because we will see increasingly funny things happen as a result of it getting worse. If things get worse, it would allow me to write many funny blog posts about people dying. I‚Äôd also be able to join a post-apocalyptic gang that goes around stealing people‚Äôs food and resources after we have a total societal breakdown."
Pocahontas Wants Trump‚Äôs Wall Money to Go to Coronavirus,2005,"Wow, nice plan Pocahontas. This is literally one of the dumbest proposals ever. The Hill: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced legislation on Thursday to redirect border wall funding to combating the coronavirus. The bill, according to Warren‚Äôs office, would result in approximately $10 billion being shifted from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ‚ÄúRather than use taxpayer dollars to pay for a monument to hate and division, my bill will help ensure that the federal government has the resources it needs to adequately respond to this emergency,‚Äù the 2020 Democratic hopeful said in a statement. The White House has suggested $2.5 billion to combat the coronavirus, while Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) is requesting $8.5 billion. What number lawmakers will end up at as they negotiate on a supplemental bill remains unclear. ‚ÄúThe United States government must do more to address the spread of the deadly coronavirus in a smart, strategic, and serious way and we stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion in Congress and with the administration to achieve this necessary goal,‚Äù Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on Thursday in a joint statement. ‚ÄúLives are at stake ‚Äî this is not the time for name-calling or playing politics,‚Äù they added. Closing borders is one of the things that would help stop the spread of the virus. But she wants to redirect funds that the orange man is using to better secure the southern border. How does this make any sense? Why not redirect all the money going to Israel to help with the virus situation? Or how about the money going to fight all these stupid Zionist wars? Seems like it would be much more logical to redirect money going to these wasteful projects. Why try to make a political point about money for border security when border security is one of the things that will help the government contain the virus? Total stupidity from this dumb Indian bitch."
Nearly Half of Americans Are Fat Pieces of Shit,1447,"A large percentage of Americans are fat because they can‚Äôt stop shoveling food in their mouths. The Sun: ALMOST half of all Americans are considered ‚Äúobese‚Äù‚Ä¶ and 1 in 10 are ‚Äúseverely overweight.‚Äù According to new data from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 40 percent of US adults are considered obese. The 2017-18 health survey, released Thursday, found the US obesity rate to be 42 percent and the severe obesity rate to be more than 9 percent. Despite a 2 percent increase in the obesity rate from a 2015-16 study, and an 1 percent rise from the previous severe obesity rate study ‚Äì the changes are not deemed to be statistically significant. But the percentage changes are so minimal that its mathematically probable that the rates didn‚Äôt truly rise. Its evident the adult obesity rates are increasing as just fifty years ago, about 1 in 100 people in the US were severely obese. Now, severe obesity is 10 times more common. This is obviously a major health crisis. But instead of addressing it as the problem that it is, the Jewish media is acting like being fat is something that should be celebrated. They openly criticize people who make fun of fat people as ‚Äúfat shamers.‚Äù You even have this nonsense with plus sized aka fat models being celebrated. They do this because they want you to be weak. Don‚Äôt be weak. If you are fat, stop eating so much and get your ass in the gym or do some sort of physical exercise."
Coronavirus Spreading Across the Globe,2050,"The coronavirus has become a big problem. It is spreading around the world. Outside of China it has hit Iran, South Korea, Japan and Italy particularly hard. AP: Police manned checkpoints in quarantined towns, governments issued travel warnings and more flights were suspended Tuesday as officials desperately sought to stop the seemingly inevitable spread of a new virus. Clusters of the illness continued to balloon outside mainland China, fueling apprehension across the globe that was reflected in sagging financial markets. The crisis pushed into areas seen as among the worst-equipped to deal with an outbreak as well as some of the world‚Äôs richest nations, including South Korea and Italy. As it proliferates, the virus is bringing a sense of urgency for local officials determined to contain it but often unsure how. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of speed and time: We must create a clear turning point within this week,‚Äù said President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, where the caseload grew by 144, with a total of 977 people sickened. Cases of people who could have infected many others spurred fears. Here are some figures. This all could have been avoided, but politicians around the world refused to take basic common sense action. The obvious thing would have been to immediately block all travel to and from China. But instead of doing that, travel continued and countries even took it upon themselves to evacuate their citizens out of areas the Chinese quarantined. Decisive action was not taken because politicians were afraid of being labeled racist chink haters and did not want to disrupt international Jewish business operations. But not taking action has been far worse for business. Just look at what happened to the stock market yesterday if you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. Don‚Äôt worry though, I‚Äôm sure the affirmative action Ethiopian that was put in charge of the World Health Organization has everything under control. He‚Äôll fix everything because his ancestors built the pyramids and invented advanced technology that White people stole. ¬†"
WHO: Coronavirus Could Infect Two-Thirds of World‚Äôs Population,1892,"A World Health Organization adviser is claiming that the coronavirus could infect billions of people. Bloomberg: As the number of coronavirus cases jumps dramatically in China, a top infectious-disease scientist warns that things could get far worse: Two-thirds of the world‚Äôs population could catch it. So says Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization who tracked studies of the virus‚Äôs transmissibility in China. His estimate implies that there could eventually be billions more infections than the current official tally of about 60,000. If the virus spreads to anywhere near that extent, it will show the limitations of China‚Äôs strict containment measures, including quarantining areas inhabited by tens of millions of people. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has credited those steps with giving the rest of China and the world a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù in which to prepare. Quarantines may slow the spread, but the virus had the opportunity to roam in China and beyond before they went into effect, Longini said. The country boosted its count of those infected by almost 15,000 on Thursday after widening the diagnosis methods. Longini‚Äôs modeling is based on data showing that each infected person normally transmits the disease to two to three other people. A lack of rapid tests and the relative mildness of the infection in some people also makes it difficult to track its spread, he said. This is certainly one of the most dire predictions yet. Disease modelers believe that¬†around four million people may have already been infected. I have no idea how bad the coronavirus will get, but it would be very funny to see billions of people die from it. Especially if the people who died from the virus were mostly niggers, gooks and brown people. The reason why I think that would be funny is because I am racist who hates people solely based on the color of their skin."
Trump Orders Limited Restrictions on Travel to China,2285,"I guess some travel restrictions to and from China is better than no travel restrictions but this might be a case of too little too late. AP: The United States on Friday declared a public health emergency and took drastic steps to significantly restrict entry into the country because of a new virus that hit China and has spread to other nations. President Donald Trump has signed an order that will temporarily bar foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days. The new restrictions, which take effect at 5 p.m. EST on Sunday, were announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is coordinating the U.S. response. ‚ÄúIt is likely that we will continue to see more cases in the United States in the coming days and weeks, including some limited person-to-person transmissions,‚Äù Azar said. ‚ÄúThe American public can be assured the full weight of the U.S. government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people.‚Äù Americans returning from China will be allowed into the country, but will face screening at select ports of entry and required to undertake 14 days of self-screening to ensure they don‚Äôt pose a health risk. Those returning from Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine. Beginning Sunday, the U.S. will also begin funneling all flights to the U.S. from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened for illness. The exception for American citizens doesn‚Äôt make any sense unless we can get some sort of confirmation that Asians are most likely to get sick from it. Of course, we do not get this type of information from the government because saying that any racial group might get a virus would be racist and being racist is the worst thing one could ever be in our great democracy. Even people who rape children have a higher social status than racists. Either way, this should not be complicated. All travel to and from China should be banned until we can sort out what‚Äôs going on. That‚Äôs what Israel did. They suspended all air travel with China until March. But that‚Äôs only because the Israeli government actually represents the best interests of their people."
UN Declares Global Emergency Over Coronavirus Outbreak,2413,"The coronavirus outbreak has been declared a global emergency by the United Nations with the number of people infected exploding exponentially. AP: The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has been exported to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week. The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an ‚Äúextraordinary event‚Äù that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries ‚Äî including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam ‚Äî where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China. The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries, he said. ‚Äú‚ÄùOur greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.‚Äù Had countries immediately shut down air travel to China, it is possible that the virus could have been contained. But still to this day, many flights are going in and out of China. Even worse is how the United States and other countries chose to evacuate hundreds of people from the very center of where this virus broke out. Outside of China‚Äôs massive quarantine, everything that has been done in response to this outbreak has been the exact opposite of what one would do if they wanted to contain the virus. Either the people making these decisions are the dumbest people alive or they are doing these things because they want millions of people to die. But considering the current state of affairs right now, it might not be a bad thing if millions of people were to die. It might even be very funny to see millions of people die."
Hundreds of Americans Evacuated From Coronavirus Epicenter,2466,"The United States government has stupidly evacuated over 200 Americans from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China. They‚Äôve been flown into Alaska and will later be proceeding on to California. SCMP: A plane evacuating more than 200 Americans from a Chinese city at the Centre of a virus outbreak continued on to southern California on Wednesday after everyone aboard passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft had stopped to refuel. All 201 passengers had already been through two screenings in China and were screened twice more in Anchorage by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. One passenger received medical attention for a minor injury that happened before boarding the plane in China, according to a news release from Alaska‚Äôs Department of Health and Social Services. The US government chartered the plane to fly out diplomats from the US Consulate in Wuhan, where the latest coronavirus outbreak started, and other US citizens. The plane landed in Anchorage on Tuesday night. Even more insane was how there was actually some debate over if these people should be placed in a quarantine. The fact that this was even debated shows how stupid everything is. Obviously if you make the dumb decision to evacuate people from the epicenter of a major virus outbreak, you should at minimum quarantine them. The British despite making the same stupid decision to evacuate their people, are at least putting them isolation for two weeks. British citizens trapped in Wuhan must agree to be held in isolation for two weeks to secure flight home. https://t.co/0lcgmJexrB ‚Äî The Times (@thetimes) January 29, 2020 But the craziest part about this whole fiasco is how air travel to and from China has not been suspended yet. The only thing the United States government has done is warn people about the risks of traveling to China. There are reportedly even flights still coming out of Wuhan the Chinese city at the middle of this virus outbreak. Flights from Wuhan still active. Wuhan to JFK #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/spkkLcOsE6 ‚Äî Tate (@Lulugus1) January 29, 2020 Even Hong Kong has restricted travel to mainland China. But there are still all sorts of direct flights going back and forth between China and the United States. This is pure lunacy. Obviously we don‚Äôt know if this is going to result in a major pandemic, but these stupid policies are only increasing the chances of one. And who knows, maybe that‚Äôs the goal."
Supreme Court Allows Restrictions on Legal Immigration,1490,"Amazingly the Supreme Court just ruled in favor of allowing restrictions on legal immigration. That‚Äôs because the Supreme Court is filled with virulent racists who hate certain types of skin color. They also like making brown children cry. Fox News: The Supreme Court will allow the Trump administration to enforce, for now, its ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù immigration restriction, lifting a pair of preliminary injunctions issued by federal judges. The Monday order followed a 5-4 split vote that divided the court‚Äôs conservatives and liberals. At issue is the administration‚Äôs rule issued in August that would restrict immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance, such as housing or health care benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the policy from being implemented while the issue is being litigated. It went through by a 5-4 margin with all four of the Jews on the Supreme Court ruling against it. It is obviously common sense not to allow people into the country who only come here to feed off of welfare and assistance programs. Of course, Jews have no problem with reallocating the wealth of White taxpayers and giving that wealth to low IQ brown and black people which is why the four Jews ruled the way they did. Either way, this Supreme Court ruling is a victory. A minor victory but still a victory. It is good to see that racism is on the rise again in America. Because without racism, America will not survive into the future."
Neocon John Bolton Writes Dumb Book to Attack Orange Man,2555,"The neocon lunatic John Bolton has penned a book attacking the orange man claiming that Ukraine aid was tied to the orange man‚Äôs desire to have Joe Biden investigated. It is clear that this information was dropped to coincide with all this impeachment bullshit in the Senate just as they are debating whether or not to call witnesses. The New York Times has been a key promoter of this story. Breaking News: President Trump said he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until its officials helped him with investigations into Democrats, John Bolton wrote in an unpublished manuscript of a new book https://t.co/J1tJ5oPZAY ‚Äî The New York Times (@nytimes) January 26, 2020 The orange man responded to this on his Twitter feed. I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2020 ‚Ä¶transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed, in addition to the fact that President Zelensky & the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems. Additionally, I met with President Zelensky at the United Nations‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J.

I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration. ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2020 This is just more stupid political theater that nobody cares about but it is likely that they are going to try and use this story to prolong this retarded circus. Anybody can read the transcript of the orange man‚Äôs phone call with Ukraine‚Äôs president and see that nothing inappropriate happened. Mitt Romney the other day expressed interest in calling witnesses and he seems hell-bent on torturing the American people with this retarded shit that nobody cares about. I guess we‚Äôll see if this chicanery is enough to convince a handful of Republicans to call witnesses. But the House had their opportunity to call witnesses and they chose not to call people like Bolton. This is all so stupid and I am getting increasingly angry just writing about this deranged nonsense. The sooner it ends the better for the mental health of all Americans."
US Stupidly Plans to Evacuate Americans From Coronavirus Epicenter,3022,"The United States government has announced a plan to try and evacuate Americans who have been caught within the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak inside of China. This plan is utterly stupid and retarded. The coronavirus has already reached the United States and bringing people from the epicenter of this outbreak back to America only risks infecting more people. Daily Mail: A third US case of coronavirus has been confirmed in California, after diagnoses in Chicago and Washington ‚Äì while Canada confirmed it‚Äôs first case Saturday. More than 2,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed by several governments worldwide as at least 56 people ‚Äì most of them in China ‚Äì have died. Orange County Health Care Agency announced that a patient in California had tested positive for novel coronavirus. The agency said the patient had traveled from Wuhan and reached out to the health care agency prior to being diagnosed. They were given guidance to avoiding exposing the public to the virus while waiting for test results. ‚ÄòThe individual has now been transported to a local hospital and is in isolation in good condition,‚Äô added the agency who did not identify the patient. ‚ÄòIn consultation with the CDC and the California Department of Public Health, the HCA is following up directly with all individuals who have had close contact with the case and are at risk of infection.‚Äô The CDC advises that casual contact, such as being in the same grocery store as an infected person is unlikely to spread the virus, and that ‚Äòthe current risk of local transmission remains low.‚Äô Canada confirmed its first case Saturday, as a man in his 50s was quarantined in Toronto, while two cases other cases were previously confirmed in the United States ‚Äì one in Chicago and another in Snohomish County, Washington. News of the virus spreading into North America comes as the United States government warns it won‚Äôt have enough seats on a rescue plane to evacuate all US citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan amid a deadly outbreak of coronavirus ‚Äì and the jet won‚Äôt even arrive for two days. The US consulate is reaching out to all Americans registered as living in Wuhan ‚Äì considered to be the epicenter of the deadly outbreak ‚Äì to offer them a seat on a charter flight scheduled for Tuesday. A source familiar with the chartered evacuation flight told CNN that roughly 1,000 Americans live in Wuhan, and those who choose to leave will be forced to pay for their spot on the Boeing 767 jet, which carries around 230 people. The logical thing to do would be to suspend any and all air travel to the impacted areas. But this is not being done because I guess such a plan would be racist or something. And the fact that they want to literally transport people from that area over here is just insane. This is such a dumb thing to do but not surprising considering that the United States government continually does dumb things. Or who knows, maybe the United States government is doing this intentionally and just wants everyone to die."
Event 201 Pandemic Simulation Eerily Similar to Coronavirus Outbreak,2953,"A few months ago a pandemic simulation called Event 201 was held by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with the John Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum. The simulation resulted in the death of 65 million people prompting the need for global coordination. Weirdly enough the virus in the simulation was called the ‚Äúcoronavirus,‚Äù the same exact name of the real world virus outbreak in China. Center for Health Security: Event 201 simulates an outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic. The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms. The disease starts in pig farms in Brazil, quietly and slowly at first, but then it starts to spread more rapidly in healthcare settings. When it starts to spread efficiently from person to person in the low-income, densely packed neighborhoods of some of the megacities in South America, the epidemic explodes. It is first exported by air travel to Portugal, the United States, and China and then to many other countries. Although at first some countries are able to control it, it continues to spread and be reintroduced, and eventually no country can maintain control. There is no possibility of a vaccine being available in the first year. There is a fictional antiviral drug that can help the sick but not significantly limit spread of the disease. Since the whole human population is susceptible, during the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases increases exponentially, doubling every week. And as the cases and deaths accumulate, the economic and societal consequences become increasingly severe. The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease. It gets weirder. Turns out that there is a ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù patent owned by the Pirbright Institute. The Coronavirus PATENT is owned by the Pirbright Institute. #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/WvgheTUSe2 ‚Äî Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, MIT PhD.

But these are the same people who just the other day were claiming with no evidence that the coronavirus was the result of chinks eating bat soup. Based on what we have here, I would say that there is far more evidence that this virus outbreak is the result of a man made biological weapon than it is the result of bat soup."
Mutating Virus Causing Havoc in China,1251,"A weird virus is spreading in China causing mass illness and death. AP: Chinese health authorities urged people in the city of Wuhan to avoid crowds and public gatherings, after warning that a new viral illness that has infected more than 400 people and killed at least 17 could spread further. The appeal came as the World Health Organization convened a group of independent experts to advise whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. The number of new cases has risen sharply in China, the center of the outbreak. Seventeen people have died, all in Hubei province, since the outbreak emerged in its provincial capital of Wuhan late last month, officials announced Wednesday night. They said the province has confirmed 444 cases there. This sort of reminds me of SARS which was an outbreak that primarily affected Asians back in the 2000s. I honestly have no idea what‚Äôs going on with this, but it is possible that this was some type of biological weapon designed to specifically target Asians or more specifically the Chinese. Of course, there might be a more mundane explanation, but it is very weird that this is primarily impacting the Chinese much like SARS did. Plus, this whole situation seemed to just happen out of nowhere."
Communist Jew Bernie Sanders Now Tied With Joe Biden in Polls,2106,"The Communist Jew Bernie Sanders is now tied in the polls with Joe Biden. Reuters: U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has been steadily climbing in popularity this year and is now tied with former Vice President Joe Biden for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination among registered voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll. The online poll, released Thursday, shows that 20% of registered Democrats and independents said they would back Sanders over 11 other candidates to run in the general election against President Donald Trump, an increase of 2 percentage points from a similar poll that ran last week. Another 19% supported Biden, 12% said they would vote for Senator Elizabeth Warren, 9% backed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and 6% said they would support Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Sanders and Bloomberg have increased their level of support in each of the last three Reuters/Ipsos polls starting in mid-December, while support for Biden, Warren and Buttigieg has remained flat. I had previously thought Sanders was done due to his health problems. But his campaign has new life thanks to the shoddy treatment he received from CNN and Elizabeth Warren. It appears as if they lied about Sanders saying that a woman couldn‚Äôt win the race. And Warren‚Äôs refusal to shake his hand after the recent debate generated additional sympathy for Sanders. The whole thing appeared to be an underhanded way to sink Sanders in favor of Warren. But this backfired spectacularly and now Sanders has risen in the polls. It is a bit weird to see a Jewish operation like CNN try to sabotage a Communist Jew like Sanders. But Sanders appears to be a true believer in Communist doctrine and this makes many members of the Jewish establishment uncomfortable. Because if you implement true Communism, all these billionaire Jews could potentially have their wealth taken via confiscation or high taxation. As bad as Communism is, you could actually make an argument that an open Communist system would be superior to the current Jewish democratic system that‚Äôs in place."
Orange Man Gives Quality Advice to Angry Retard Greta Thunberg,937,"After the angry retarded child Greta Thunberg was named Man of the Year by TIME Magazine, the orange man gave some solid quality advice to her.

It is not healthy to be obsessed with baseless climate doomsday conspiracies while telling everyone that they need to eat bugs and pay carbon taxes to prevent a climate apocalypse from occurring.

8 out of 10 Americans Say Politics Most Stressful Part of Their Life,2007,"A new poll says that a huge majority of Americans believe that politics is the most stressful aspect of their life. Study Finds: U.S. politics have never felt quite as contemptuous, and unavoidable, as they do today. We‚Äôre a nation of people who are constantly plugged in, whether that be via smartphone, desktop, or regular old cable news. As such, it‚Äôs hard for the average adult to go so much as an hour without at least casually glancing at a sensationalized headline, nasty social media comment fueled by political disdain, or television screen featuring a bias news pundit. Now, a new survey of 2,000 Americans finds that all of this vitriol filled political discourse is taking a serious mental toll. An astounding 78% of respondents say politics are the number one source of anxiety and stress in their life. The survey, commissioned by LIFEAID Beverage Co., also identified on-the-job worries (51%), and financial matters (51%) as other common factors stressing Americans out. Another major stressor for many is health and medical issues (37%), and 25% say their commute to work each day is a stressful nightmare. Surprisingly, 37% of respondents listed their own partner as a big source of personal anxiety and stress. Other frequently cited stressors included social media (29%) and climate change (32%). All of that stress is complicating other aspects of life, as well, with two-thirds (67%) of respondents admitting their constant anxiety is causing them to be less productive at work. Not surprised to see this at all. This is a direct result of all this bullshit we see promoted in the Jewish media. They‚Äôve spent the past three years covering every little detail of this Jewish hoax impeachment circus. Worse yet is how you see a constant gaslighting of people by the Jewish media in their promotion of outright lies. None of this is good for anybody‚Äôs health or sanity. But this stress and frustration is a direct result of Jews because Jews have been the main group behind this dumb shit."
Hillary Clinton Appears on Jew Howard Stern‚Äôs Show,2846,"Hillary Clinton appeared on the Jew Howard Stern‚Äôs show in what feels like a never ending quest for attention and validation. Some have speculated that she made this appearance because she is planning on announcing a surprise 2020 run for the presidency. This is something Tucker Carlson has been predicting but considering how close we are to the first primary elections, that seems somewhat unlikely. Of course, this hasn‚Äôt ended the speculation. Her appearance on Stern‚Äôs show has only fueled more speculation that she‚Äôs planning a surprise run. NY Post: The strongest indicator yet that Hillary‚Äôs mulling a 2020 run? She appeared Wednesday, for the first time ever, on Howard Stern. There was hardly a pretense she was there to promote the book she co-wrote with daughter Chelsea, long ago a bestseller. As those who listen to the show know, Stern publicly begged Hillary to appear during the 2016 campaign. After Donald Trump won, Stern said one guest shot could have moved the needle her way. ‚ÄúIf she had come on the show . . .,‚Äù Stern mused in May. ‚ÄúThe way I helped Donald was I let him come on and be a personality. Whether you liked him or not . . . people related to him as a human being.‚Äù Hillary, it‚Äôs clear, was after exactly that ‚Äî relatability, long her white whale. One can only ask: Why now, if she has no plans to run yet again? Sure, it‚Äôs possible she just loves being part of the national conversation. But of all the venues such a serious stateswoman could choose, one whose public presentation has been so carefully cultivated over decades, really: Howard Stern? She hasn‚Äôt closed the door on 2020. Just this past weekend, during an appearance on the UK‚Äôs ‚ÄúGraham Norton Show,‚Äù Hillary said she‚Äôd been ‚Äúdeluged‚Äù with pleas to run again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have to make up my mind really quickly,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs moving very fast.‚Äù A reference, perhaps, to latecomer Mike Bloomberg? Stern was an able ally, allowing Hillary to expound on her ability to work across the aisle (despite no signature legislation while serving New York in the US Senate), her support for the Osama bin Laden raid and her role in advising the president, her plans for her first 100 days as president (health care), and her concerns for the future of the country, which felt especially raw during Trump‚Äôs inauguration. ‚ÄúIf I had lost to a normal Republican,‚Äù Hillary said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have a pit in my stomach.‚Äù Like all of her media appearances, it was boring and I couldn‚Äôt give a shit about anything this sadistic bitch has to say. But if she were to run again, appearing on Stern‚Äôs show is a logical move. The highlights or lowlights of the appearance was her doing another one of her coughing fits and claiming that she is not a lesbian and likes men. It was mostly a softball interview by Stern and crew and not recommended viewing in my opinion."
Ebola Response Workers Killed by Wild Niggers in the Congo,1627,"Why are people still attempting to save Africans from the ebola virus? Look at what just happened to a group of aid workers in the Congo. AP: Rebels killed four Ebola response workers in an overnight ambush in eastern Congo, the World Health Organization said Thursday, warning that the attack will give the waning outbreak new momentum in what has been called a war zone. ‚ÄúWe are heartbroken that our worst fears have been realized,‚Äù WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. It was by far the deadliest such attack in the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history, the United Nations health agency said. The dead included a member of a vaccination team, two drivers and a police officer. Many of the six others wounded were with Congo‚Äôs health ministry. Mai-Mai fighters attacked a camp housing scores of aid workers overnight in Biakato, local official Salambongo Selemani told The Associated Press. Warnings had been posted demanding that the health workers leave or face ‚Äúthe worst,‚Äù Selemani said. The other attack targeted an Ebola response coordination office in Mangina, WHO said. Allied Democratic Forces rebels are to blame, Beni territory administrator Donat Kasereka Kibwana said. Let ebola kill all these niggers. There are already too many niggers on the planet and saving them is a net negative to the world. The niggers there don‚Äôt even want anybody‚Äôs help as evidenced by how they just killed a bunch of aid workers who were there trying to help them. Or am I just being a mean racist guy for not believing that one of these low IQ niggers if saved from ebola would cure cancer, invent time travel or some shit?"
San Francisco‚Äôs Shit Problem is Getting Worse,1758,"San Francisco continues to be one of the most disgusting cities in the United States. That‚Äôs because the Communist assholes that run the city refuse to do anything substantive about all the homeless niggers that are shitting everywhere. Breitbart: There has been an increase in the number of complaints about feces in the streets of San Francisco lately, according to city data obtained by rental site RentHop.
RentHop found using public data from the city‚Äôs website where people can complain to the city about reports of human and animal waste that the city has received more than 25,000 complaints about fecal matter between January and November of this year. ‚ÄúIts a serious public health concern. Its a public relations concern when you have a city that‚Äôs driven by tourism and conventions and visitors from all over the world. Its frankly embarrassing,‚Äù one San Francisco resident told KRON. According to RentHop, the city‚Äôs 311 reporting system for human and animal waste complaints received 28,315 complaints about feces in 2018‚Äî up 35 percent from 2017. The complaints include both human and animal feces. The problem has become so out of hand for the city that in 2018, the city‚Äôs Department of Public Works announced that it would be taking care of the situation with a ‚Äúpoop patrol‚Äù to clean up the streets of what people had dubbed ‚ÄúSan Fransicko.‚Äù The city has also begun to install public toilets at specific locations throughout the city to minimize waste on the streets. If nothing is done about this problem soon, I‚Äôm going to hope that either North Korea or China nukes the entire city. It‚Äôs already a biological wasteland any way and at least if it were nuked it would get rid of the disgusting niggers that are shitting all over the place."
Apple to Ban All Vaping Apps,1486,"Wow, what a dumb decision by a company that keeps doing increasingly stupid shit. BBC: Apple is removing all vaping apps from its online store. It said it had taken the decision because of growing official concerns about the impact vaping can have on health. In the US, 42 deaths and more than 2,100 cases of lung injury have been linked to a respiratory illness tied to vaping. Apple‚Äôs decision means a total of 181 apps will not be available on iPhones, reports tech news site Axios. This is a total overreaction to manufactured media hysteria designed to demonize if not destroy the vaping industry. The deaths and respiratory illnesses associated with vaping have been because people have been using some fucked up underground THC vaping gizmos. The vast majority of vaping products are not causing these extreme health problems. I believe that all this anti-vaping news has been part of a campaign by the tobacco industry to destroy competition. If more young people are vaping, it means a loss in business for tobacco companies. There are far worse problems happening in America than what is going on with vaping. Whatever the case, Apple is retarded for removing these vaping apps. Nobody was even demanding that they do such a thing. They should do something useful like ban all apps pertaining to gay anal sex. Oh wait, they won‚Äôt do that because the company is run by a man who regularly engages in gay anal sex. Never mind. Tim Cook, Apple CEO and a faggot who sucks on cock."
Dan Crenshaw Confronted by Some Groypers at Texas A&M,1100,"The Zionist shill Dan Crenshaw was confronted by some groypers during a speaking appearance at Texas A&M this afternoon. A groyper recorded it and streamed it on Twitter. https://t.co/qe4pByzb9b ‚Äî Blessed Prince Zuko the Groyper (@ZUKOofAthens) November 4, 2019 This is the only recording of the question and answer session with Crenshaw that I‚Äôm aware of. A few groypers were able to ask questions about non-White immigration and Ben Shapiro, but many of the other questions were boring and possibly from plants and shills. Several stupid questions about taxes, health care, climate change and the ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù were posed. It was clear that they were trying to avoid giving groypers the opportunity to ask questions. Crenshaw is also scheduled to speak tonight at 7PM-8PM CST, so hopefully that session will be more interesting. If they avoid giving groypers the opportunity to ask questions, there might not be any other option but to intentionally disrupt the event so real questions can be asked. Azzmador is currently doing a live stream¬†with a prominent Chinese lawyer discussing the topic."
Veterans of Iraq and Afghan Wars are Plagued With Cancer,1129,"Veterans of the insane Iraq and Afghan wars are coming down with all sorts of cancers. McClatchy: Veterans saw a spike in urinary, prostate, liver and blood cancers during nearly two decades of war, and some military families now question whether their exposure to toxic environments is to blame, according to a McClatchy investigation. McClatchy found that the rate of cancer treatments for veterans at Department of Veterans Affairs health care centers increased 61 percent for urinary cancers ‚Å†‚Äî which include bladder, kidney and ureter cancers ‚Å†‚Äî from fiscal year 2000 to 2018. The rate of blood cancer treatments ‚Å†‚Äî lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia ‚Å†‚Äî rose 18 percent in the same period. Liver and pancreatic cancer treatment rates increased 96 percent and prostate cancer treatment rates increased 23 percent. Pretty terrible, but I‚Äôm sure all the fake conservatives out there think that what has happened to these people has been a small price to pay. After all, America only exists to defend Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East. There is no other purpose to America except to defend Zionist Jews from brown people."
Hospital Technology is Apparently Racist,2159,"Hospital technology is being accused of racism. We can credit the highly credible Washington Post blog site and other very smart individuals for this very insightful information. Fast Company: Artificial intelligence experts have been warning for years that bias in automation could cause unintentional harm in the future. But it‚Äôs also happening with technology that‚Äôs being used right now. In a recent paper published in Science, researchers lay out how a common algorithm used in hospitals to assess whether a patient needs extra care was making significantly biased recommendations. According to researchers, the algorithm was disproportionately suggesting more white patients for a continued care program than black patients, even when black patients were sicker. Only 17.7% of black patients were getting additional care, when 46.5% of them should have been, the report found. The algorithm is used across health systems and is estimated to impact about 100 million people around the country, according to both STAT and the Washington Post. The bias appears to stem from how the system, which the Washington Post identifies as being made by the health services company Optum, quantifies what it means to be sick. Rather than using illness or biological data, the algorithm uses cost and insurance claim information to understand how healthy a person is. The more dollars spent, the logic goes, the sicker a person is. The data revealed that less was being spent on black patients in part because they were receiving less care. Notably, the study points, algorithms based on cost are widely used in health care. Here‚Äôs the problem. Artificial intelligence and the algorithms that drive this sort of technology are driven by logic and not emotion. Perhaps the technology has evolved to a point where it realizes that blacks as a group are a burden on society. But what are all these people going to do about this? Do they really think they can shut down the development of AI technologies at this point? The genie is already out of the bottle. Logic dictates that different races behave differently and AI systems are going to recognize these differences."
Pocahontas is Now the Democrat Presidential Front-Runner,1871,"It is looking increasingly likely that Elizabeth Warren aka Pocahontas is going to win the Democrat presidential nomination. Joe Biden has made tons of verbal fuck ups on the campaign trail and has had his campaign sabotaged by the Democrat impeachment circus that has been launched against the orange man. It has indirectly exposed his corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China. So his popularity in the polls is plunging like a rock. He‚Äôs also hated by the progressive wing of the party. The Jew Bernie Sanders just had a heart attack and is around 80-years-old. As a result of his health problems, he can no longer be considered a viable candidate. Kamala Harris got destroyed in the debates by Tulsi Gabbard and is hated by blacks because she‚Äôs mixed-race and a cop. So her campaign is pretty much done with. And this leaves Pocahontas as the Democrat presidential front-runner. None of the other minor candidates are garnering any momentum and there is no buzz or excitement around anything they‚Äôre doing. I do however expect Gabbard and Andrew Yang to emerge as dark horse candidates. Sort of like what Ron Paul did on the Republican side in 2008 and 2012, but neither of them stand a chance of winning the nomination. Even if they did manage to gain a surge in momentum and match Pocahontas in the polls, the Democrat establishment would screw them just like they screwed Bernie in 2016. Now granted, a great deal can change over the next several months. But right now it is looking as if Warren is the most likely candidate to win the nomination. And I don‚Äôt see a scenario in which she can possibly defeat the orange man. She‚Äôs going to be ruthlessly mocked as a fake Indian and destroyed during any debates she has with him. At least it will be funny to see all these stupid millennial feminist whores cry when Pocahontas loses. It will be like 2016 all over again."
Huge Increase in STDs Throughout the United States,1716,"I am not in the least bit surprised to learn of this news. STDs are rapidly increasing throughout the United States. US News: CASES OF THREE COMMON sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. reached a record level in 2018, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gonorrhea and cases of primary and secondary syphilis ‚Äì the disease‚Äôs most infectious stages ‚Äì both reached their highest levels since 1991 last year. The country‚Äôs 115,045 syphilis cases included more than 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis, marking a 14.9% rate uptick from 2017. Meanwhile, there were more than 583,000 cases of gonorrhea, a rate increase of 5% from 2017, and the rate of reported chlamydia cases rose 3% to total more than 1.7 million in 2018 ‚Äì nearly two-thirds of which were among people 15 to 24 years old, the report shows. The main reason why this is happening is because young women are mostly all a bunch of disgusting whores. The average modern day woman in America has probably slept with 100 men by the time she‚Äôs reached the age of 25. This is why STDs are on the rise. They can‚Äôt keep their legs closed and they can‚Äôt resist riding around on the proverbial cock carousel. So they‚Äôre spreading gross diseases around through their various holes. And this is yet another reason why I have lost almost all interest in American women. Not only are they incapable of cooking, won‚Äôt clean shit and are arrogant bitches, but many of them are infected with disgusting diseases. What value do these women have? Their value is even lower than that of a prostitute. At least prostitutes have a strong financial incentive to ensure that their vaginas don‚Äôt get infected with diseases."
Planned Parenthood Constructs Enormous Baby-Killing Facility,1735,"Planned Parenthood a terrorist organization that encourages women sacrificing their children to the demon Moloch, has announced the construction of an enormous baby-killing facility. CBS News: After over a year of secret construction, Planned Parenthood announced its newest abortion facility on Wednesday: an 18,000-square-foot mega-clinic in southern Illinois. The new location is just 13 miles away from Missouri‚Äôs last remaining abortion clinic, a facility in St. Louis fighting to keep its license. Since August 2018, Planned Parenthood has used a shell company to construct the facility, leaving no public trace that the former medical office would become one of the largest abortion clinics in the country. CBS News first visited the site in August, while it was still being built. Colleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said the facility was built in secret to avoid protestors and delays. Other Planned Parenthood projects had run into problems once the public realized the construction was for an abortion provider. In one instance, a communications company had refused to install telephone and data lines; in another, a cabinet maker never delivered an order, McNicholas said. In Birmingham, Alabama, protestors targeted Planned Parenthood‚Äôs suppliers, flooding their social media accounts with fake negative reviews. If what Planned Parenthood is doing is so innocent, they would not have had to construct this facility in secret using a shell company. Planned Parenthood is obviously a very sick institution which is why it is loved by Jews. It should be shut down immediately. Sacrificing babies to Moloch has nothing to do with women‚Äôs health."
Bernie The Jew Might Be Close to Death,2010,"It looks like the Jew Bernie Sanders is having some serious health problems and could be close to death. Las Vegas Review Journal: With the severity of his heart condition unknown, it‚Äôs too soon to say when ‚Äî or even if ‚Äî Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders might return to the campaign trail, according to two Las Vegas cardiologists. Sanders‚Äô medical prognosis ‚Äî and the future of his campaign ‚Äî depend ‚Äúon whether or not he had a heart attack,‚Äù said Dr. Keith Boman, a cardiologist who has practiced in Las Vegas for 40 years. Boman, who is not one of Sanders‚Äô doctors, noted that chest pain ‚Äúwould be a typical presentation for a blocked artery or for a heart attack.‚Äù Sanders‚Äô campaign stated that he had blockage in one artery and had two stents successfully inserted. The candidate had experienced ‚Äúchest discomfort‚Äù at a campaign event in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Official campaign statements did not say whether Sanders experienced a heart attack. The Wall Street Journal quoted campaign spokesman Mike Casca on Wednesday as saying Sanders did not have a heart attack, then updated the story to say Casca later stated that more tests would be run to determine that diagnosis. To insert a stent, doctors thread a tiny balloon inside a blocked artery to widen it. The stent, a small wire mesh tube, is then inserted to keep the artery open. This does not look good for Bernie. It also raises serious questions about his legitimacy as a presidential candidate. People are not going to vote for someone who could potentially drop dead while they are in a political race against the bad orange man. But despite my many political disagreements with Bernie, I do not wish death on the man. lol just kidding, I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck if this old Jew kicked the bucket. His Jewish Marxist bullshit is bad for all of us, so quite honestly, we‚Äôd actually be far better off if he died as soon as possible. But you could also say the same thing about many other Jews, many of who are far worse than Bernie."
Spic Charged With Terrorism After Driving Car Through Mall,1077,"Here‚Äôs another shining example showing what a disaster multiculturalism has been. A savage spic driving his car into a mall. WGN-9: The man accused of driving through Woodfield Mall has been transferred into police custody and charged with terrorism. On Friday, Javier Garcia, 22, of Palatine, was released from AMITA Health Behavior Medicine institute and charged with terrorism, a Class X felony, and criminal damage to property, a Class 2 felony. Following an investigation, police believe Garcia drove a black SUV through Sears and into the mall on Sept. 20 and acted alone. Police said a motive has not been determined and they believe Garcia was not targeting any specific person or business. There are all sorts of articles on a daily basis detailing how non-White racial minorities are committing violent crimes, destroying property etc.. across the country. These savages are a net-negative to our society. I want them all gone. I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck if they have papers, are citizens or whatever. Throw them in camps if needed. I don‚Äôt give a shit at this point."
Swiss Protest Rollout of 5G,1811,"The Swiss are protesting the rollout of 5G wireless network technology due to health concerns surrounding the radiation levels emitted by 5G antennas. AFP: Switzerland was among the first countries to begin deploying 5G, but health fears over radiation from the antennas that carry the next-generation mobile technology have sparked a nationwide revolt. Demonstrators against the technology are due to fill the streets of Bern later this month, but already a number of cantons have been pressured to put planned constructions of 5G-compatible antennae on ice. The technology has been swept up in the deepening trade war between China and the United States, which has tried to rein in Chinese giant Huawei ‚Äî the world‚Äôs leader in superfast 5G equipment ‚Äî over fears it will allow Beijing to spy on communications from countries that use its products and services. But far from the clash of the titans, a growing number of Swiss are voicing alarm at possible health effects from exposure to the electromagnetic rays radiating from the new antennae, and are threatening to put the issue to a referendum in the country famous for its direct democratic system. This rush to push out 5G is unwarranted. If there are health concerns, they should be vetted before rushing to push this out to everyone. It‚Äôs not like there is this immediate need for faster wireless Internet. 4G is fine for most people and there are wifi hotspots everywhere now. As I‚Äôve said before, I think 5G should be rolled out first in Israel. If the technology doesn‚Äôt end up frying the six million Jews that live there, then maybe we can consider rolling it out to the rest of the world. But this 5G technology just appears to be another way to expand the ability to spy on everyone and anyone. They don‚Äôt want you to be able to escape the grid."
Americans are Really Fat and Disgusting,1178,"We have far too many fat people in America. The Sun: Obesity levels have reached nearly 40 per cent in parts of the United States, a shocking new map reveals. The map shows that in nine states ‚Äì Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and West Virginia ‚Äì adult obesity is at or above 35 per cent. But in West Virginia and Mississippi that figure hits 39.5 per cent, according to data from the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across the whole of the US, only three states have obesity levels under 25 per cent, and none have less than 20 per cent. What I don‚Äôt get is how so many people let this happen to themselves. Do they not have any self-discipline? Are they incapable of doing exercise? And this inability for people to take care of themselves leads them to go to doctors who give them all sorts of drugs to help them with health problems that they wouldn‚Äôt have if they weren‚Äôt so damn fat. You also have the Jewish media trying to sell people on this idea that being fat is a perfectly normal thing and that we shouldn‚Äôt criticize people for being a gross tub of lard. It is a disgusting situation overall."
BBC Film Tells Children There are 100 Genders,1965,"The BBC has put together a film explaining to children that there are a total of 100 different genders. Telegraph: ‚ÄúWhat are the different gender identities?‚Äù asks a little boy in one of the nine new BBC Teach films put out to support the personal, social and health education (PSHE) curriculum in schools ‚Äì to which his head teacher replies: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really, really exciting question‚Ä¶‚Äù Actually, it‚Äôs not. And the answer is still less exciting. Which is perhaps why rather than give the boy a bald, biological and distinctly boring fact ‚Äì ‚Äútwo‚Äù ‚Äì the video cuts to a Relationships and Sex Education teacher, hopped-up on her own gaping-mindedness: ‚ÄúYou know, there are so many gender identities,‚Äù she enthuses. ‚ÄúWe know that we have got male and female, but there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now.‚Äù Even by today‚Äôs Emperor‚Äôs New Clothes gender diversity narrative, 100 is pushing it. ‚ÄòWoke‚Äô Facebook currently lists 71 complex and hilariously repetitive options for those who feel manacled by the oh-so-reductive ‚Äòmale‚Äô and ‚Äòfemale‚Äô. And, despite four years at medical school (where you‚Äôd hope the basics had been covered), your local GP will ‚Äòonly‚Äô recognise six genders: male, female, gender-neutral, non-binary, gender-fluid and gender-queer. But children, insists the BBC‚Äôs Relationships and Sex Education teacher Kate Daniels in the film, might well find these too limiting and think to themselves: ‚Äú‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really want to be anything in particular. I am just going to be me.‚Äô‚Äù This is obviously insane and I have lost my patience with these people. Anybody who says that there are more than two genders is mentally ill. But now these freaks are telling children that there 100 different genders. Even Piers Morgan has had it with this shit. Just look at his face. This is the face of a man who is ready to start firing up the ovens. This is child abuse. The people who put this film together definitely deserve to be gassed in shower rooms."
ThinkProgress Shuts Down,2810,"Many of these leftist shill websites have been propped up with huge sums of money and don‚Äôt register any sort of profit. ThinkProgress was one of those sites. It was losing money and they couldn‚Äôt find a buyer so it has been forced to shut down. Thanks to everyone who supported ThinkProgress during its time as a source of independent journalism. Your every visit to our site was a kindness, it meant so much to us. This one goes out to everyone who loved a website that died too young.https://t.co/kaFzCEqjAD ‚Äî ThinkProgress (@thinkprogress) September 7, 2019 Daily Beast: ThinkProgress, the influential news site that rose to prominence in the shadow of the Bush administration and helped define progressivism during the Obama years, is shutting down. The outlet, which served as an editorially independent project of the Democratic Party think tank Center for American Progress (CAP), will stop current operations on Friday and be converted into a site where CAP scholars can post. Top officials at CAP had been searching for a buyer to take over ThinkProgress, which has run deficits for years, and according to sources there were potentially three serious buyers in the mix recently. But in a statement to staff, Navin Nayak, the executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said the site was ultimately unable to secure a patron. ‚ÄúGiven that we could find no new publisher, we have no other real option but to fold the ThinkProgress website back into CAP‚Äôs broader online presence with a focus on analysis of policy, politics, and news events through the lens of existing CAP and CAP Action staff experts,‚Äù said Nayak. ‚ÄúConversations on how to do so are just beginning, but we will seek to reinvent it as a different platform for progressive change.‚Äù A dozen ThinkProgress employees will be losing their jobs, a CAP aide said, as many who were on staff had already gone to work elsewhere and some were incorporated into the larger CAP infrastructure. Those who are being laid off will be given a severance package that runs through the end of November and health care coverage that lasts through the year, said the CAP aide. Notice how all these people at ThinkProgress just gave up when the money ran out. It shows that these leftists can‚Äôt push their retarded world views unless they have huge sums of money paying people to pump out their bullshit propaganda. Unlike these leftists who do this for the shekels, I write articles because I view what I‚Äôm doing to be important. If it was about the money I would have quit a long time ago since I‚Äôve been banned from every payment processor in existence. But yeah, I would expect to see other leftist sites like ThinkProgress be forced to shut down over the next few years considering the amount of shekels they require to operate."
Robert Mugabe Longtime Negro Ruler of Zimbabwe is Dead,1424,"Robert Mugabe the longtime Negro ruler of Zimbabwe has died. He ran Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was removed from power following a military coup. BBC: Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean independence icon turned authoritarian leader, has died aged 95. Mr Mugabe had been receiving treatment in a hospital in Singapore since April. He was ousted in a military coup in 2017 after 37 years in power. The former president was praised for broadening access to health and education for the black majority. But later years were marked by violent repression of his political opponents and Zimbabwe‚Äôs economic ruin. Mugabe despite managing to run Zimbabwe for such a long period of time, totally mismanaged the country formerly known as Rhodesia. Here are the highlights/lowlights of his time in power. He implemented a brutal police state. He oversaw an economy with out of control inflation. The inflation got so bad that it became cheaper to wipe your ass with Zimbabwe paper currency than to buy actual toilet paper. He stole farms from White people to give them to blacks. But after the blacks failed to run the farms and the country ran our of food, he allowed the White people back. If there‚Äôs anything to take away from Mugabe‚Äôs rule it is that blacks are stupid and can‚Äôt run countries. And Mugabe was arguably one of the more successful black leaders of an African country considering how long he was able to hold on to power."
WHO Says Microplastics in the Water are Safe,2054,"This is insane. But if a so-called ‚Äúexpert‚Äù says insane things, it is taken seriously by people even if what they are saying is completely bat shit crazy. CNN: They may be in our oceans, rivers and ice but there‚Äôs little evidence to suggest that microplastics in the water we drink pose a risk to our health. In its first review on the health risks of plastic in tap and bottled water, the World Health Organization said that microplastics ‚Äúdon‚Äôt appear to pose a health risk at current levels,‚Äù but the key finding came with a big caveat ‚Äî the review said available information was limited and more research was needed on microplastics and how they affect human health. ‚ÄúWe urgently need to know more about the health impact of microplastics because they are everywhere ‚Äî including in our drinking water,‚Äù said Dr. Maria Neira, director of the Department of Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health at WHO. WHO said it did not recommend routine monitoring of microplastics in drinking water and said that concerns over microplastics should not distract water suppliers and regulators from removing microbial pathogens, such as those causing deadly diarrheal diseases. Yeah, no need to worry about microplastics in your water goyim. The water is perfectly safe. Just like how water fluoridation is good for your dental health even though Israel suspended its entire practice and a recent study showed that fluoridated water lowered IQ levels. What a nightmarish hell we live in. Meanwhile we‚Äôre told over and over again that ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù or ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù is the most pressing environmental problem we face. This despite the fact that all evidence shows that it is a fraud. Tangible environmental problems like this situation we have with plastic is a real and present environmental concern yet none of these so-called environmental groups even want to talk about it. They just want to ramble on about carbon emissions and claim that you are against science if you disagree with their cultish belief in this climate change hoax."
Study Links Fluoride Consumption With Lower IQs,3469,"A medical journal has published a study linking the consumption of fluoridated water with lower IQs. Daily Beast: An influential medical journal published a study Monday that links fluoride consumption during pregnancy with lower childhood IQs‚Äîa finding that could undermine decades of public-health messaging, fire up conspiracy theorists, and alarm mothers-to-be. The research was expected to be so controversial that JAMA Pediatrics included an editor‚Äôs note saying the decision to publish it was not easy and that it was subjected to ‚Äúadditional scrutiny.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is the only editor‚Äôs note I‚Äôve ever written,‚Äù Dimitri Christakis, editor in chief of JAMA Pediatrics and a pediatrician, told The Daily Beast. ‚ÄúThere was concern on the journal‚Äôs editorial team about how this would play out in the public eye and what the public-health implications would be.‚Äù About three-fourths of the United States drinks fluoridated tap water‚Äîwhich the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared one of the 10 greatest public-health achievements of the 20th century because it dramatically reduces tooth decay. A handful of earlier studies have suggested that prenatal fluoride exposure could affect neurodevelopment, but many experts considered those to be substandard. The new study, vetted by the premier medical publisher in the U.S., is seen as more rigorous. ‚ÄúWhen we started in this field, we were told that fluoride is safe and effective in pregnancy,‚Äù said study co-author Christine Till of York University in Toronto. ‚ÄúBut when we looked for the evidence to suggest that it‚Äôs safe, we didn‚Äôt find any studies done on pregnant women.‚Äù They recruited 512 pregnant women from six Canadian cities and measured their exposure several ways: analyzing the amount of fluoride in their urine; looking at how much tap water and tea they drank; and comparing the fluoride concentration in the community drinking water. Then, when the women‚Äôs children were 3 or 4, the researchers gave them IQ tests and crunched the numbers to see if they could find any trends. ‚ÄúWe saw an association between prenatal fluoride exposure and lower IQ scores in children,‚Äù study author Rivky Green said. Specifically, they found a 1 mg per liter increase in concentration of fluoride in urine was associated with a 4.5 point decrease in IQ among boys, though not girls. Another translation: The boys of mothers with the most fluoride in the urine had IQs about 3 points lower than the boys of mothers with the least amount. When the researchers measured fluoride exposure by examining the women‚Äôs fluid intake, they found lower IQs in both boys and girls: A 1 mg increase per day was associated with a 3.7-point IQ deficit among both genders. I‚Äôve always believed that fluoridating the water supply was just a means to make the population stupid. Looks like this study confirms my suspicions. And get this, the Israelis have already discontinued this practice. Go figure? All this bullshit about preventing tooth decay seems to have just been an excuse to put this garbage in the water. I‚Äôd imagine there‚Äôs lots of corporate interests who profit off of its production and benefit off of water fluoridation. But the fact that the Jewish media has made it a point to promote water fluoridation as a good thing is in of itself reason enough to remove it from the water. People who question its use are not crazy conspiracy theorists. We are rational people who are asking legitimate questions."
Trump Moves to Restrict Legal Immigration??,2166,"This is certainly a surprise considering some of Donald Trump‚Äôs prior statements about wanting immigrants to come in legally to fill manufacturing jobs. AP: The Trump administration is moving forward with one of its most aggressive steps yet to restrict legal immigration, denying green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance, officials said announced Monday. Federal law already requires those seeking to become permanent residents and gain legal status to prove they will not be a burden to the U.S. ‚Äî a ‚Äúpublic charge,‚Äù in government speak ‚Äîbut the new rules detail a broader range of programs that could disqualify them. It‚Äôs part of a dramatic overhaul of the nation‚Äôs immigration system that the administration has been trying to put into place. While much of the attention has focused on President Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, the new change targets people who entered the United States legally and are seeking permanent status. Its part of an effort to move the U.S. to a system that focuses on immigrants‚Äô skills instead of emphasizing the reunification of families. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now weigh public assistance along with other factors such as education, household income and health to determine whether to grant legal status. The rules will take effect in mid-October. They don‚Äôt apply to U.S. citizens, even if the U.S. citizen is related to an immigrant who is subject to them. This sounds like a step in the right direction even if a bunch of Jewish groups file lawsuits to fight it. So I definitely support this move. It does seem as if Trump is doing a better job at controlling the levers of government since the Russia hoax fell apart. But ultimately, the amount of immigration coming into America should be zero until we can figure out what the fuck is going on. The entire system has been a total and complete mess. Especially since the 1965 Immigration Act was passed. It opened the country to a bunch of third world savages and low IQ monkeys. And nobody can argue that the country is better off as a result of it."
Nigger Obama Blames Trump for Mass Shootings,1723,"Get a load of this shit from the nigger Obama. pic.twitter.com/nNOVtQ50O4 ‚Äî Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 5, 2019 He‚Äôs basically blaming Donald Trump for the mass shootings and being a supporter of racist violence even though this nigger spent years inciting blacks to riot over retarded hoaxes. He literally promoted this idea that White police officers were Neo-Nazi, White supremacists that conspired to do harm against blacks for no specific reason. If anybody is a promoter of violence it is this nigger. And don‚Äôt get me started on what he did to Libya. Obama doesn‚Äôt even mention the fact that the Dayton shooter was an anti-fascist, a satanist and a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. He singles out Trump because he said things that hurt the feelings of Mexicans or whatever. His entire statement was bullshit gibberish. Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs response. ‚ÄúDid George Bush ever condemn President Obama after Sandy Hook. President Obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign. Not many people said Obama is out of Control. Mass shootings were happening before the President even thought about running for Pres.‚Äù @kilmeade @foxandfriends ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2019 The bottom line is this. These mass shootings are going to continue because there is no attempt by the established political system to adopt real solutions. In fact, much of what is happening is only going to ensure more mass shootings take place. There is no serious attempt to address the failures of multiculturalism, tackle mental health issues or listen to the political grievances of young White men. All we hear is nonsense about gun control, videogames and other stupid shit that has nothing to do with the root of the problem."
El Paso Shooter Patrick Crusius‚Äô Manifesto,14292,"Below is the complete manifesto reportedly written by Patrick Crusius in text form entitled ‚ÄúThe Inconvenient Truth.‚Äù The manifesto is apparently getting deleted everywhere so here it is in its full form. The Inconvenient Truth About Me In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto. This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion. Some people will think this statement is hypocritical because of the nearly complete ethnic and cultural destruction brought to the Native Americans by our European ancestors, but this just reinforces my point. The natives didn‚Äôt take the invasion of Europeans seriously, and what‚Äôs left is just a shadow of what was. My motives this attack are not at all personal. Actually the Hispanic community was not my target before I read The Great Replacement. This manifesto will cover the political and economic reasons behind the attack, my gear, my expectations of what generate and my personal motivations and thoughts. Political Reasons In short, America is rotting from the inside out, and peaceful means to stop this seem to be nearly impossible. The inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing for decades. They involved are either complacent of or in of the one biggest betrayals the us American public in history. The takeover of the United States by our government unchecked corporations. I could write a ten page essay on all the damage these corporations have caused, but here is what is important. Due to the death of the baby boomers, the increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric of the right and the ever increasing Hispanic population, America will soon become a one party-state. The Democrat party will own America and they know it. They have already begun the transition by pandering heavily to the Hispanic voting bloc in the 1‚Ä≥ Democratic Debate. They intend to use open borders, free healthcare for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political by importing and then coup legalizing millions of new voters. With policies like these, the Hispanic support for Democrats willikely become nearly unanimous in the future. The heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold. Losing Texas and a few other states with heavy Hispanic population to the Democrats is all it would take for them to win nearly every presidential election. Although the Republican Party is also terrible. Many factions within the Republican Party are pro-corporation. Pro- corporation pro-immigration. But factions some within the Republican Party don‚Äôt prioritize = corporations future. So the Democrats nearly unanimous with their over our support of immigration are while the Republicans divided it. At least with Republicans, the are process of mass immigration over and citizenship can be greatly reduced. Economic Reasons In short, immigration only be detrimental can to the future of America. Continued immigration will make of the issues of one biggest our time, automation, that so much under worse. Some in sources say two decades, half of American jobs will be lost to it. Of people will be retrained, but most course some will not. So it makes no sense to keep on letting millions of illegal or legal immigrants flood into the United States, and to keep the tens of millions that already here. Invaders who also have close to the are highest birthrate of all ethnicities in America. In the basic near future, America will have to initiate a universal income their Joblessness in to prevent widespread poverty and civil unrest people lose jobs. as itself is of civil The welfare the better. a source unrest. less dependents on a government system, The lower the unemployment rate, the better. Achieving ambitions social projects like universal healthcare and UBl would become far likely succeed if more to tens of millions of dependents are removed. Even though new migrants do the dirty work, their kids typically don‚Äôt. They want to live the American Dream which is why they get college degrees and fill higher-paying skilled positions. This is why corporations lobby for even more illegal immigration even after decades of it of happening. They need to keep replenishing the low-skilled labor pool. Even as migrant children flood skilled jobs, Corporations make this by lobbying for work visas be issued for skilled workers worse even more to foreign to come here. Recently, the senate under a REPUBLICAN administration has greatly increased the number of foreign workers that will take American jobs. Remember that both Democrats and Republicans support immigration and work visas. Corporations need to keep replenishing the labor pool for both skilled and unskilled jobs to keep down. So Automation is it eliminate need a good thing will the for wages as new migrants to fill unskilled jobs. Jobs that Americans can‚Äôt survive on anyway. Automation can and would replace millions of low-skilled jobs if immigrants were deported. This of competition for skilled source labor from immigrants and visa holders around the world has made a very difficult situation even worse for natives as they compete in the skilled job market. To compete, people have to get better credentials by spending more time in college. It used to be that a high school degree was worth something. Now a bachelor‚Äôs degree is what‚Äôs recommended to be competitive in the job market. The cost of college degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted. This has led to a generation of indebted, rqualified students filling menial, low paying and unfulfilling jobs. Of course these migrants and their children have contributed to the problem, but of are not the sole cause it. The American lifestyle affords our citizens an incredible quality of life. However, our lifestyle is destroying the environment of our country. The decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations. Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly overharvesting This has been a problem for decades. For example, this resources. phenomenon is brilliantly portrayed in the decades old classie ‚ÄúThe Lorax‚Äù. Water sheds around the country, especially in agricultural areas, are being depleted. Fresh water is being polluted from farming and oil drilling operations. Consumer culture is creating thousands of tons of unnecessary plastic waste and electronic waste, and recycling to help slow this down is almost non-existent. Urban sprawl creates inefficient cities which unnecessarily destroys millions of of land. We even use god knows how acres off hands. many trees worth of towels paper just wipe water our Everything I have and heard seen in my short life has led that me to believe the isn‚Äôt average American willing to change their lifestyle, if even the changes only The these cause a slight inconvenience. government is unwilling to tackle issues beyond empty promises since they are owned by corporations. Corporations that also like immigration because more people means a bigger market for their products. I just want to say that I love the people of this country, but god damn most of y‚Äôall are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle. So the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then of life become sustainable. our way can more Gear Main gun: AK47 (WASR 10)-I realized pretty quickly that this isn‚Äôt a great choice since it‚Äôs the civilian version of the ak47. It‚Äôs not designed to shoot rounds quickly, it overheats massively after about 100 so shots fired in quick succession. I‚Äôll have to heat-resistant use a glove to get around this. 8m3 bullet: This bullet, unlike actually fragments pistol pretty much other 7.62√ó39 bullet, like any a hollow point when shot out of ak47 of Penetration still reasonable, but an at the cost penetration. is not nearly as high normal ak47 bullet. The ak47 is definitely bad choice without this bullet design, and as a a may still be with it. this doesn‚Äôt Other gun(if I variation get one): Ar15- Pretty much of gun heat any up nearly fast the as as AK47. The round of this gun isn‚Äôt designed to fragment, but instead tumbles inside a target causing lethal wounding. This gun is probably better, but I wanted to explore different options. The ar15 is probably the best for military applications but this isn‚Äôt a military application. gun This will be a test of which is more lethal, either it‚Äôs fragmentation tumbling. or less. have I didn‚Äôt spend much time at all preparing for this attack. Maybe month,probably less. I have to do this before I lose my nerve. I figured that under-prepared attack and meh manifesto is better than no attack and no manifesto Reaction Statistically, millions of migrants have returned to their home countries to reunite with the family they lost contact with when they moved to America. They here economic immigrants, not for asylum come as home This is that Hispanic is to to reasons. an encouraging sign the population willing return their will countries if given the right incentive. An incentive that myself and other many patriotic Americans provide. This will the threat of the Hispanic bloc which will make for the loss remove voting of up millions of baby boomers. This will also make the elites that corporations realize that it‚Äôs not in their run interest to continue piss off Americans. Corporate America doesn‚Äôt need to be destroyed, but just shown that they the side of history. That if they don‚Äôt bend, they will break. are on wrong Personal Reasons and Thoughts My whole life I have been preparing for future that currently doesn‚Äôt exist. The job of dreams will a my lkely be automated. Hispanics will take control of the local and state government of my beloved Texas, changing policy to better suit their needs. They will turn Texas into an instrument of a political coup which will hasten the destruction of our country. The environment is getting worse by the year. f you take nothing else from this document, remember this: INACTION IS A CHOICE.I Can no longer bear the shame of inaction knowing that our founding fathers have endowed with the rights needed to save me our country from the brink destruction. Our European comrades don‚Äôt have the gun rights needed to repel the millions of invaders that plaque their country. They have choice but to sit by and watch no their countries burn. America only be destroyed from the inside-out. If can our country falls, it will be the fault of traitors. This is why I faultless. Because this isn‚Äôt act of imperialism but act of preservat ion. see my actions as an an America is full of hypocrites who will blast actions the sole result of racism and hatred of other my as countries, despite the extensive evidence of all the problems these invaders and will cause cause. People who are hypocrites because they support imperialistic that have caused the loss of tens of wars thousands of American lives and untold numbers of civilian lives. The argument that mass murder is whole okay when it is state sanctioned is absurd. Our government has killed lot people for a more a whole lot less. Even if other non-immigrant targets would have a greater impact, I can‚Äôt bring myself to kill fellow my Americans. Even the Americans that if seem hell-bent on destroying our country. Even they are shameless race mixers, massive polluters, haters of our collective values, etc. One day they will see error of their Either when American and ways. patriots fail to reform it our country collapses when or we save it. But they will of see the error their ways. I promise y‚Äôall that. l am against race mixing because it destroys genetic diversity creates identity problems. Also because it‚Äôs completely and 2 and 3 unnecessary selfish. generation Hispanics form interracial unions at much higher rates than Yet another send them back. Cultural and racial average. reason to diversity is largely temporary. Cultural diversity diminishes as stronger and/or more appealing cultures overtake weaker and/or undesirable ones. Racial diversity will disappear as either race mixing or genocide will take place. But the idea of deporting or murdering all non-white Americans is horrific. Many have been here at least as long as the whites, and have done as much to build our country. The best solution to this for now would be to divide America into a confederacy of territories with at least 1 territory for each This physical separation would nearly eliminate race mixing and improve social race. unity by granting each self-determination within their race respective territory(s). My death is likely inevitable. If ‚Äòm not killed by the police, then r‚Äôl probably be gunned down by of one the invaders. Capture in this if far case worse than dying during the shooting because I‚Äôl get the death penalty anyway. Worse still is that I would live knowing that my family despises me. This is why I‚Äôm not going to surrender even if I run out of ammo. If ‚Äòm captured, it will be because I was subdued somehow. Remember: it is not cowardly to pick low hanging fruit. AKA Don‚Äôt attack heavily guarded areas to fulfill your super soldier COD fantasy. Attack low security targets. Even though you might out gun a security guard or police man, they likely beat in armor, training and numbers. Do not throw life you away your on an unnecessarily dangerous target. If a target seems too hot, live to fight another day. My ideology has not changed for several years. My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president. I putting this here because some people will blame the President or certain presidential candidates for the attack. This is not the case. I know that the media will probably call white me supremacist and blame media infamous anyway Trump‚Äôs rhetoric. The media is infamous for fake news. Their reaction to this attack will likely just confirm that. Many people think that the fight for America is already lost. They couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. This is just the beginning of the fight for America and Europe. I am honored to head the fight to reclaim my country from destruction."
Bees Reportedly Drop Dead Around 5G Towers,1029,"A video claiming to show a bunch of dead bees around newly installed 5G towers has apparently gone viral on the Internet. Daily Star: The superfast broadband has sparked controversy since rolling out this year, with health experts claiming it could have serious side effects on humans. And there are now claims online that bees could also be affected after a video went viral. The clip ‚Äì taken in Sierra Madre, California ‚Äì shows the lifeless bodies of the bees lying on the ground. Philip Sites claimed they were spotted between two 5G poles ‚Äì about 40ft apart. I have no idea if the video is authentic or not, but there appears to be enough legitimate concerns about 5G for us to take a closer look at this technology. I think what we should do is test 5G out in Israel for a lengthy period of time. After all, Jews are the chosen people of God and they deserve to have the fastest wireless Internet possible. Us goyim are not worthy of this advanced technology so it should be first rolled out to the Jews before anybody else."
Arizona Lawmaker Says US Will Soon Look Like South America,2131,"An Arizona lawmaker has apologized for identifying one of the biggest problems the United States faces as a country. AP: A veteran Arizona legislator is apologizing while defending herself from criticism for comments she made on immigration and birth rates. The Phoenix New Times posted audio of a July 15 speech during which state Sen. Sylvia Allen said a flood of immigration and low birth rates among whites amid a lack cultural assimilation mean ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to look like South American countries very quickly.‚Äù The Republican from Snowflake, Arizona, who is white, also said the U.S. has to regulate immigration so the country can provide jobs, education, health care and other needs. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt provide that if people are just flooding us and flooding us and flooding us and overwhelming us,‚Äù she said. Wendy Rogers, a Republican running for the state Senate seat now held by Allen, issued a statement Saturday denouncing Allen‚Äôs comments as ‚Äúvery racist‚Äù and said Allen should retire from the Legislature. Democratic state Sen. Martin Quezada told the Arizona Republic that the ‚Äútone and perspective‚Äù of Allen‚Äôs remarks on migrants were ‚Äúinsulting, to say the least.‚Äù The Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee in a statement compared the comments to those of former Arizona Rep. David Stringer. In June 2018, the Prescott Republican said there ‚Äúthere aren‚Äôt enough white kids to go around‚Äù in the United States and called immigration ‚Äúan existential threat.‚Äù She should have never apologized. That‚Äôs the biggest problem we have. Politicians keep apologizing for simply stating obvious facts about what‚Äôs going on around us. We have an extreme demographic crisis in the United States thanks to the insane 1965 immigration law that was passed which opened the country to all sorts of third world populations. We also have the insanity of birth right citizenship. If the demographic trends continue, the United States is absolutely going to look like Brazil or other South American countries within the next several decades. That‚Äôs why it is absolutely imperative that we get a hold of this problem and we do it now."
Ebola Spreads to Major City in the Congo,1608,"The ebola virus has spread to a city in the Congo with two million people. AP: The deadly Ebola outbreak in Congo is now an international health emergency, the World Health Organization announced Wednesday after a case was confirmed in a city of 2 million people . A WHO expert committee declined on three previous occasions to advise the United Nations health agency to make the declaration for this outbreak, even though other experts say it has long met the required conditions. More than 1,600 people have died since August in the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, which is unfolding in a region described as a war zone. A declaration of a global health emergency often brings greater international attention and aid, along with concerns that nervous governments might overreact with border closures. The declaration comes days after a single case was confirmed in Goma, a major regional crossroads in northeastern Congo on the Rwandan border, with an international airport. Also, a sick Congolese fish trader traveled to Uganda and back while symptomatic ‚Äî and later died of Ebola. Ebola in my view appears to be nature‚Äôs way of controlling the nigger population which has gotten totally out of control. The entire continent of Africa should be quarantined while we let ebola do its magic. Because if their population is not controlled, they‚Äôll flood into White countries and destroy them. Long story short, if millions of these jungle niggers die of the ebola virus, it would be a net benefit to the world. If you disagree, I‚Äôd love to hear a logical explanation as to why you think that way."
Angela Merkel Seen in Public Shaking Again,1022,"The treasonous wench Angela Merkel who betrayed the German people by flooding them with violent low IQ brown hordes from the third world, has been seen in public several times shaking uncontrollably. She is clearly not well. The Sun: GERMAN chancellor Angela Merkel was seen shaking uncontrollably again today amid growing fears for her health. She appeared to tremble as she received the Finnish PM Antti Rinne in Berlin. It is the third time in as many weeks Merkel has looked unsteady at official engagements, sparking fears for her health. On June 27 she gripped her trembling arms and pursed her lips at a ceremony in Berlin ‚Äì nine days after footage emerged of her shaking for a whole minute. On previous occasions she has blamed her unsteadiness on overheating or dehydration. But the temperature in Berlin today only reached a mild 18C. It‚Äôs time for this horrible bitch to step down and resign. She‚Äôll probably be dead soon any way. She is no doubt destined for hell considering what she did to the German people."
Jews and Leftists Are Really Mad at Trump‚Äôs July 4th Parade,2407,"Even though I‚Äôve had some major issues with Donald Trump as of late, having him as President has been far preferable to the alternative. Just the fact that he is in the White House has caused all sorts of kvetching from Jews and leftists. Here we have another example of how he is irritating these people to no end. They‚Äôre greatly upset at the July 4th parade he has ordered in Washington DC. The parade is going to prominently feature a wide array of American military equipment. These clowns are whining about how the equipment is going to cause damage to the roads and coming up with bullshit reasons as to why this parade is a bad thing. The hashtag #BoycottTrump4thOfJuly is trending on Twitter as I write this. Here are some sample tweets from assholes with blue check marks. No one should support a phony president who wants to play dictator and waste millions on a party to celebrate himself while he has kids locked in his overcrowded child prisons.

Historically, they have been events that serve to unify a people and a country. That‚Äôs why you can see why these Jews and leftists hate what Trump is doing. They do not want us to be a unified people otherwise it makes it more difficult for them to engage in their chicanery. It‚Äôs just too bad that our country has been subverted by these kikes and the military is being used to fight all these retarded wars for Israel. I think people would be much more supportive of the military if they were actually defending our borders and fighting for America. It would make the idea of a military parade much more meaningful. Take for example the parades they used to have in Germany. Top tier aesthetics."
Jewish 9/11 Attack on America is Still Killing First Responders,2682,"One of the worst things about the 9/11 attacks is that firefighters, police and other first responders were tasked with doing a massive cleanup of the buildings after that fell. They were ordered to do this job despite the fact that the air was toxic from asbestos and other building materials that were destroyed. Many of these first responders later developed all sorts of horrible diseases as a result of their exposure to these elements. Even though he was on the brink of death, one of these men named Luis Alvarez testified to Congress a few weeks ago begging them to provide consistent health benefits to those first responders. That man has since died stemming from illnesses he suffered due to his exposure to the toxic air around ground zero. NBC News: Luis Alvarez, the retired police officer who along with Jon Stewart appeared before Congress earlier this month to plead for consistent health benefits for 9/11 first responders, has died. The Ray Pfeifer Foundation, a nonprofit that helps first responders who became ill after 9/11 with medical needs not covered by insurance, shared the news on social media Saturday morning. ‚ÄúWe lost another 9/11 first responder. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of NYPD Detective Luis Alvarez,‚Äù the organization wrote on Twitter. The fact that the kike Jon Stewart was with him is a slap in the face. Stewart spent much of his career doing The Daily Show which during the 2000s was actually a somewhat culturally significant program. Throughout his tenure, he covered up the Jewish involvement in the 9/11 attacks and spent his energy attacking people like Dick Cheney while raging about wars for oil. I don‚Äôt believe for a second that he gives a shit about any of these first responders. He is only offering his public support to misdirect people from finding out that the Jews were involved in the attacks. The reason why there was such a rush to clean up the rubble is because a proper forensic analysis of the scene would have revealed many inconvenient things about what really happened. The Jews couldn‚Äôt have that which is why the first responders were ordered to clean up the mess as quickly as possible irregardless of what that would do to their health. The metal from the buildings was actually shipped out of the country. It was a massive operation designed to cover up evidence. This shouldn‚Äôt sit well with anybody. And if it doesn‚Äôt sit well with you, you should be angry at the Jews. They along with the Saudis were the one‚Äôs primarily involved in the attacks. They were also the one‚Äôs who gained the most from what happened. The death of this man and all those other first responders is on their hands."
Yang Wins 2nd Democrat Debate Despite Having No Time to Speak,2673,"I did not watch the second Democrat debate last night largely because I did not want to torture myself listening to all of the retarded Democrat shills ramble on about emotional gibberish.

Outside of that, all of the participants said that they would support giving free healthcare to illegal aliens. They said many other fucked up things but this was perhaps one of the most fucked up things they all agreed on. Trump tweeted about how crazy this was and it has been one of his more ‚Äúliked‚Äù tweets in recent memory.

Jew Bernie Sanders Proposes Eliminating All Student Debt,3146,"Even though the Jew Bernie Sanders is literally an insane Communist, he is right about a few things. His proposal to eliminate all student debt is among them. AP: Days before the first Democratic presidential debates, Sen. Bernie Sanders and House progressives rolled out legislation to cancel all student debt, going farther than a signature proposal by Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the two jockey for support from the party‚Äôs liberal base . By canceling all student loans, Sanders says the proposal would address an economic burden for 45 million Americans. The key difference is that Warren‚Äôs plan considers the income of the borrowers, canceling $50,000 in debt for those earning less than $100,000 per year and affecting an estimated 42 million people in the U.S. Questions face both candidates about how to pay for all of that plus their proposals for free tuition at public colleges and universities. But the battling ideas highlight the rivalry between senators who have made fighting economic inequality the cornerstones of their 2020 presidential campaigns. Sanders vowed at a Monday news conference that his plan ‚Äúcompletely eliminates student debt in this country and the absurdity of sentencing an entire generation, the millennial generation, to a lifetime of debt for the crime of doing the right thing. And that is going out and getting a higher education.‚Äù He appeared alongside the proposal‚Äôs House sponsors, Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., with American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten also in attendance. His bill and Warren‚Äôs plan are part of their broader appeal to liberal voters on issues such as health care, technology and education. Student debt should absolutely be forgiven because the whole system has been nothing but a gigantic fraud perpetuated against young people. The millennial generation was told by baby boomers that they‚Äôd be a worthless piece of shit if they didn‚Äôt take out huge amounts of debt and get a four year degree. As it turns out, these degrees with the exception of a handful of STEM degrees have little value. I mean, they‚Äôre giving out degrees to niggers on the basis that they have a certain skin color. That alone tells you how much value these pieces of paper are worth. There are boomer ‚Äúconservative‚Äù types arguing against this by claiming it is ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and that it would be bad economics. Well, do you know what is bad economics? Spending trillions of dollars to wage endless war on behalf of Jews and Israel. That‚Äôs bad economics, but for some reason we don‚Äôt see many people making economic arguments against that. At least forgiving student debt is a tangible investment in a generation of people who were fucked over by a corrupt system. It‚Äôs a real investment in the future. If every millennial who got scammed by this fucked up system had their student debt forgiven, they‚Äôd be free to do all sorts of things. This is absolutely something that should happen. If Donald Trump wanted to win re-election in a landslide, all he‚Äôd have to do is work with the Jew Bernie to forgive all this student debt."
America is Being Invaded by Diseased Third World Hordes,2176,"Many of the third world hordes who are invading America are very sick and carrying all sorts of diseases and illnesses. Washington Examiner: Some Border Patrol agents in Texas are concerned about exposure to Ebola by a migrant fleeing the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the United States. But more of them are worried about other illnesses frequently popping up among detainees at stations across the southern border, according to union representatives. Border Patrol‚Äôs holding facilities in the Del Rio and El Paso sectors, or regions, are inundated with sick detainees, as well as sick agents. Jon Anfinsen is a National Border Patrol Council vice president and based in Del Rio, which includes Eagle Pass, where most Congolese are arriving. Anfinsen represents approximately 1,000 agents who are based out of 10 regional holding stations. Anfinsen has been an agent 12 years and said the number of people in custody and subsequent illnesses among that population is ‚Äúunprecedented.‚Äù ‚ÄúScabies, chickenpox ‚Äî we had one case of the mumps here in Uvalde. I wanna say we had measles ‚Äî plenty of the flu, plenty of colds, body lice, just assorted. And some of these things, they spread like wildfires when you get into a cramped holding cell. It happens,‚Äù Anfinsen said. The continuous breakouts ‚Äî in part caused by the overcrowded conditions in facilities and difficulty quarantining each sick person ‚Äî are taking both a physical and mental toll on agents. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so much the workload. It‚Äôs the constant illnesses. We have a lot of agents who are sick. The other day I talked to agents from four different stations. And every single one of them had a cough,‚Äù Anfinsen said. How the hell is this not considered a major health crisis let alone a national security crisis? The border should have been totally closed a long time ago. Who cares about the economic consequences when we have diseased goblin hordes storming our border? This is completely fucking insane. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that Donald Trump is going to do one single substantive thing about this problem. He‚Äôs relying on Mexico to solve this problem which in of itself is ridiculous."
Jews Go Nuts After New York Ends Religious Exemption for Vaccinations,1817,"Orthodox Jews are going nuts after New York passed a law ending vaccination exemptions on religious beliefs. CBS NY: New Yorkers can no longer claim religious exemptions to avoid vaccinations. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill yesterday that ended vaccination exemptions based on religious beliefs. The measure is meant to protect the public amid the worst measles outbreak in decades, which the governor called a ‚Äúpublic health crisis.‚Äù Cuomo said the new law takes effect immediately. ‚ÄúIf your kid is immunocompromised and going to school or a day care center, you want to know that they‚Äôre going to be safe,‚Äù said State Sen. Brad Hoylman, who sponsored the bill. The measles outbreak started in October and spread through parts of Brooklyn, particularly in the Orthodox Jewish communities. Since the start of June, there have been more than 250 confirmed cases in Rockland County. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our obligation to act. We have to do everything we can to get the number of people vaccinated up,‚Äù State Sen. David Carlucci, who represents Westchester and Rockland counties, said. Parents against vaccinations protested in Assembly chambers Thursday. ‚ÄúThe government does not have the right to interfere with my personal religious beliefs,‚Äù said one woman. ‚ÄúWe will not vaccinate. What‚Äôs going to happen is we‚Äôre going to either home school or we‚Äôre going to move out of state.‚Äù Ah, so Jews are threatening to leave over this bill? If that‚Äôs the case, maybe the solution to getting this parasitical race out of our countries is to ban religious exemptions for vaccinations nationwide. It will encourage these Jews to leave and go to Israel. Even if these vaccines do cause autism, it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a bad thing. That‚Äôs because we have hard evidence that many autists eventually become anti-Semitic shitposters on 4Chan."
Pinterest‚Äôs Censorship Agenda Blown Open by Whistleblower,2202,"A whistleblower from inside of the social media company Pinterest has just blown open their massive agenda to censor user content. The unnamed whistleblower did an interview with Project Veritas and provided documented evidence showing how they censor user content. He specifically described how Pinterest classified a pro-life, anti-abortion website Liveaction.org as pornography in order to block users from posting links to it. He also showed how they deliberately censored references to Christianity including Bible verses. They even decided that they needed to censor the Jew Ben Shapiro for being a White supremacist and ban the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù website The Gateway Pundit for hate speech. One of the documents provided by the whistleblower shows how they would hide content if you used the term ‚Äúgay‚Äù or ‚Äúretarded.‚Äù They would also block anybody who made fun of ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter.‚Äù And if you made reference to ‚ÄúWhite Lives Matter‚Äù or a term along those lines, their official policy was to hide that content as ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù so other people couldn‚Äôt see it. Pinterest also hides so-called ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù including ones about the official story of 9/11 being a lie and how the Jew George Soros finances anti-conservative causes. Another document provided by the whistleblower shows how they would actively target people who posted terms like 1488, Turner Diaries or other terms related to White nationalism in order to fight so-called ‚Äúhate speech.‚Äù Users posting content containing anti-Moslem content would also be targeted. Unfortunately, after this report dropped, Pinterest discovered who the whistleblower was and fired him. They also decided to block the pro-life website Liveaction.org entirely. Overall, this was solid journalism from James O‚ÄôKeefe and Project Veritas. This is the type of work that the mainstream media would be doing if we actually had a healthy functioning society that wasn‚Äôt run by Jews. Tim Pool has published a video reacting to the Project Veritas report. He dissects some of the information that Project Veritas didn‚Äôt go into all that deeply. Project Veritas has promised a second part to this Pinterest story which I‚Äôm very much looking forward to seeing."
Slate Calls for Social Media Regulations to Restrict Free Speech,3414,"The leftist fucktards over at Slate, just published an article demanding social media companies be regulated. The problem is that they are demanding the kind of regulations that would further restrict free speech. Slate: Communications infrastructure, particularly when that technology has a broadcast function, is powerful. People are able to use it to misinform and spread hate to an audience in the millions every day. People also rely on social media to get information to make decisions about where they‚Äôll send their kids to school, their health care, and whom they‚Äôll vote for. Politicians who are thinking now about what to do about the mess that social media has become might find inspiration in policies that guided broadcast technology for decades‚Äîpolicies rooted in an understanding that corporations that want to make as much money as possible will always prioritize profits above all else. Protecting the safety of their users will always come second. That‚Äôs where laws are supposed to come in. It‚Äôs time we got some. The author named April Glaser who may or may not be a kike, claims that freedom of speech isn‚Äôt the same thing as freedom to broadcast. Freedom of speech isn't the same as the freedom to broadcast and amplify that speech. I wrote about how public interest obligations over US broadcasters work and why it's such a useful frame when thinking about social media regulation https://t.co/g3Kdxgmx8Q ‚Äî april glaser (@aprilaser) June 7, 2019 That statement definitely sounds like something a kike would say. She is trying to create a distinction without a difference. There is literally no difference between these two things. And having the government restrict specific people having the ability to reach audiences while enabling others to reach those same audiences gives a certain group of people greater free speech rights. This is against the spirit of the First Amendment which guarantees the same free speech rights to everyone. But basically, the article promotes this idea that the government needs to restrict speech on the Internet in the name of public safety. What a bunch of bullshit that is. Free political speech and the spread of specific ideas is not a threat to public safety. This is far different than people calling for a specific person‚Äôs death or trying to organize a hate mob after somebody. Those are not lawful activities and are unrelated to free political speech. Plus, these illegal activities are almost always orchestrated by anti-fascists and other leftist groups. And besides, the more you restrict free political speech, the greater the chance there is for violence. This alone makes the entire argument surrounding public safety so comical. If they were concerned about public safety, they‚Äôd be adopting our position advocating for a maximum amount of free political speech. Unfortunately, what we have going on right now are private companies in Silicon Valley stifling the political speech of millions of people. The government needs to regulate them in such a way where they are required to give universal access to everybody. All voices should be on a level playing field. That‚Äôs the only solution to this problem. But it is not surprising to see Slate try and capitalize on the Steven Crowder situation to call for even more draconian forms of censorship. What a bunch of dipshits these people at Slate are. They can all get fucked for all I care."
Border Patrol Buying 2.2 Million Diapers,1969,"The government doesn‚Äôt have money to build infrastructure to secure the border but they somehow have money to buy 2.2 million diapers for invading third world hordes. Breitbart: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is buying 2.2 million diapers to help deliver economic migrants and their young children into Americans‚Äô worksites, schools, and neighborhoods, according to an online contract request. The purchase implements the welcome policy set by a bipartisan panel in Congress, which in February directed the Department of Homeland Security to help the migrants ‚Äî despite the impact on Americans‚Äô wages, schools, and neighborhoods ‚Äî instead of helping Americans by giving the agency the legal authority needed to block the migration. The purchase request was posted May 31 and is numbered 20113222-a. It asks for diapers, baby wipes, and showers shoes. For example, the first item on the shopping list is ‚ÄúDISPOSABLE DIAPERS, SIZE 2 144 per case ALL ITEMS WILL HAVE 5 DELIVERIES DELIVERY JUNE 15 800 BOXES JULY 1 800 BOXES AUGUST 1 800 BOXES SEPTEMBER 1 800 BOXES SEPTEMBER 30 800 BOXES.‚Äù The 2.2 million diapers are being bought with funds provided in the February border spending bill for the DHS. The bill included ‚Äú$192,700,000 for improved medical care, transportation, and consumables to better ensure the health and safety of migrants who are temporarily in [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] custody,‚Äù according to a congressional Explanatory Statement of the provisions. The money is also being used to fly migrants from the border to their target job sites and homes in the United States. This just gives further incentive to these invading hordes. They are being told that they‚Äôll be taken care of if they make the journey and invade America. Donald Trump was elected to put an end to this shit and he has totally failed. Stories like this is proof of his failure. How the fuck is shit like this even happening? This country is totally fucked."
Julian Assange is Reportedly Being Tortured,2271,"There‚Äôs all sorts of reports coming out detailing how Julian Assange is basically being tortured while in custody. Guardian: Julian Assange is showing all the symptoms associated with prolonged exposure to psychological torture and should not be extradited to the US, according to a senior UN expert who visited him in prison. Nils Melzer, UN‚Äôs special rapporteur on torture, is expected to make his appeal to the UK government on Friday. It comes after Assange, the co-founder of WikiLeaks, was said by his lawyers to be too ill to appear by video link for the latest court hearing of the case on Thursday. Assange has been moved to the health ward of Belmarsh prison, London, where he has been serving a 50-week sentence for skipping bail while fighting extradition to the US. He is accused of violating the Espionage Act by publishing secret documents containing the names of confidential US military and diplomatic sources. After meeting Assange earlier this month in the company of medical experts who examined him, Melzer will say on Friday that he fears the Australian‚Äôs human rights could be seriously violated if he is extradited to the US and will condemn what he describes as the ‚Äúdeliberate and concerted abuse inflicted for years‚Äù on him. This whole situation is nuts. All Assange did was publish documents provided to him by sources inside of governments. He is a journalist and in fact one of the few real journalists who has done important reporting over the past few decades. For his efforts in exposing government wrongdoing, he was setup on fake rape charges and forced to languish inside of Ecuador‚Äôs embassy for many years. And since being dragged out of the embassy he is reportedly being tortured. It boggles the mind that supposed reporters cheered his incarceration. Much of that appears to be out of professional jealousy as they will never be anywhere near the important figure that Assange has become. But what you see happening to Assange is no different than what the Soviets did to political dissidents. And yet we are told that we live in a vibrant and free society. What a load of bullshit that is. A vibrant and free society would not torture people for simply publishing documents exposing bad things that the government has been doing."
WHO Declares Trannyism Normal and Gaming a Mental Illness,1580,"The World Health Organization has just declared that cutting your dick off and claiming that you are a woman is normal. TIME: The World Health Organization (WHO) will no longer categorize being transgender as a ‚Äúmental disorder‚Äù, after a major resolution to amend its health guidelines was approved May 25. The United Nations‚Äô health agency approved a resolution to remove ‚Äúgender identity disorder‚Äù from its global manual of diagnoses, in a move that will have a ‚Äúliberating effect on transgender people worldwide,‚Äù says Human Rights Watch. According to the newly-revised version of the International Classification of Diseases (known as ICD-11), published by the WHO, ‚Äúgender identity disorders‚Äù have been reframed as ‚Äúgender incongruence.‚Äù Gender nonconformity is now included in a chapter on sexual health, rather than being listed with ‚Äúmental disorders‚Äù as was the case previously. Activists are now hoping that the ICD-11 will be implemented by the WHO‚Äôs 194 member states over the next three years. However, if you play video games for lengthy periods of time they are saying that you are mentally ill. Look, I get that I‚Äôm not a doctor or a licensed medical professional, but this doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense to me. It would seem to me that having the desire to cut your cock off and claim that you are a woman is a very serious disorder. This seems to be a far more serious problem than if you simply like to play video games. But what do I know. I‚Äôm sure the Jews and the fine people at the World Health Organization are far smarter than I and know the real deal."
Syria‚Äôs Assad Accused of Gassing His Own People Again,1909,"Syria‚Äôs leader Bashar Al-Assad has already been accused of gassing his own people on several occasions. Despite these accusations being nothing but Jewish hoaxes, they were enough to convince Donald Trump that he had to respond by launching missiles against Syria‚Äôs government. On one occasion, the only evidence offered was some video showing children getting sprayed with water hoses. It‚Äôs only fitting that Assad is being accused of gassing his own people again. The Jews really seem to like accusing their enemies of gassing people. Must be something in their DNA that causes them to do this. Guardian: The US says it has seen signs the Syrian government may again be using chemical weapons in its attritional offensive to recapture the last rebel-held pocket of the country, warning the use of any such weapons would incur retaliatory measures from Washington and its allies. The alleged attack occurred on Sunday on the border of Idlib province, where in recent weeks the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has stepped up an air and ground campaign that has killed at least 150 people and displaced more than 200,000 from their homes. Local reports said four hardline Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) fighters were injured by chlorine released by munitions dropped near the village of Kabana on Sunday. The use of chlorine was alleged by the Idlib province health directorate but has not been corroborated by monitoring groups or international media. No casualties were reported in the mountainous area, where most residents have fled because of fighting. There‚Äôs no reason to believe these claims. Why would Assad who has taken back control over his country with the help of the Russians just randomly gas people? Especially considering that it is the only thing that has invited military intervention from the West. There are zero reasons for him to do such a thing. This whole thing is a bunch of bullshit."
"Pastor Cons 50,000 Ugandans Into Drinking Bleach",1703,"An American pastor has managed to con 50,000 Ugandans into drinking industrial bleach. He told them that drinking his industrial bleach formula will cure cancer, AIDS and other diseases. They apparently believe him. Guardian: An American pastor from New Jersey backed by a British former clairvoyant is running a network that gives up to 50,000 Ugandans a ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù made from industrial bleach, claiming drinking the toxic fluid eradicates cancer, HIV/Aids, malaria and most other diseases. The network, led by pastor Robert Baldwin and part-funded by Sam Little from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, is one of the most extensive efforts yet to distribute the ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù known as MMS, or ‚Äúmiracle mineral solution‚Äù. The Guardian has learned that poor Ugandans, including infants as young as 14 months old, are being given chlorine dioxide, a product that has no known health benefit and can be extremely dangerous. Baldwin, 52, is importing bulk shipments of the components of MMS, sodium chlorite and citric acid, into Uganda from China. The two chemicals are mixed to produce chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach used in the textile industry. The American pastor has ‚Äútrained‚Äù about 1,200 clerics in Uganda on administering the ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù and each in turn uses it to treat about 50 congregants, usually after Sunday service. As an inducement, Baldwin is offering smartphones to those clerics who are especially ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to spreading the bleach cure. This shows how stupid blacks are. We could easily genocide them if we had the political will to do so. All you‚Äôd have to do is tell them that a poisonous formula cures diseases or makes their dick bigger and they‚Äôll consume the formula and die."
Trump Unveils Immigration Plan Written by Jew Kushner,2642,"Donald Trump unveiled an immigration plan that the Jew Jared Kushner was heavily involved in drafting. While it sounds like it would be a modest improvement to the status-quo if implemented, the fact that Kushner was involved in drafting it, makes me immediately question everything about it. The basic gist of the plan is that it would transform the immigration system from being family-based to merit-based. But it still means massive amounts of legal immigration which is insane. We need to put an end to all immigration. Legal immigration is in many ways much more of a problem than illegal immigration. Trump is justifying continuing all of this legal immigration because of economic reasons. As if the health of the economy should be the only deciding factor on if we let people into the country or not. We‚Äôve let in all sorts of third world hordes that have completely transformed the country into an increasingly shittier place. We don‚Äôt need any more immigration be it legal or not. Ann Coulter was on Twitter bashing the proposal today and she makes some valid points. NO WALL. KEEPS SAME MASSIVE LEVELS OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION. And this is the rube-bait campaign document, not even a serious bill. ‚Äî Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 16, 2019 MSM: Trump‚Äôs immigration bill does nothing about ‚ÄúDreamers.‚Äù No, doing ‚Äúnothing,‚Äù means they get to stay ‚Äî and yet another year goes by with no enforcement against millions of illegal aliens. ‚Äî Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 16, 2019 If you become VERY proficient at English, @realDonaldTrump, someday you will understand the meaning of the word ""WALL."" ‚Äî Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 16, 2019 Great that Trump wants language proficiency for immigrants. How about language proficiency for presidents? wall /w√¥l/ noun 1.a continuous vertical brick or stone structure that encloses or divides an area of land. ‚Äî Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 16, 2019 If Democrats didn't hate America so much, they'd attack Trump's immigration bill as a gift to the Koch brothers. ‚Äî Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 16, 2019 What happened to the total immigration moratorium? We need a break! ‚Äî Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 16, 2019 It seems reasonable to assume that this proposal is going nowhere. The Democrats aren‚Äôt going to give Trump anything so this is just an attempt to placate his supporters who read sites like Breitbart. Meanwhile, the border is not secure and our country is being flooded by the entire population of Central America. It‚Äôs a shame that our $700 billion a year military can only be used to fight wars for Israel. It would be quite handy if we could actually use it to stop this invasion."
Ebola Waging Total War Against Africans,1690,"Ebola appears to be nature‚Äôs attempt to control the population of low IQ niggers on the planet. The virus is raging in the Congo. Guardian: An Ebola epidemic in a conflict-riven region of Democratic Republic of Congo is out of control and could become as serious as the outbreak that devastated three countries in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, experts and aid chiefs have warned. New cases over the past month have increased at the fastest rate since the outbreak began last year, as aid agencies struggle to enact a public health response in areas that have suffered decades of neglect and conflict, with incredibly fragile health systems and regular outbreaks of deadly violence involving armed groups. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very concerned ‚Äì as concerned as one can be,‚Äù said Jeremy Farrar, the head of the Wellcome Trust, who called for a ceasefire to allow health teams to reach the sick and protect others in the community. ‚ÄúWhether it gets to the absolute scale of west Africa or not, none of us know, but this is massive in comparison with any other outbreak in the history of Ebola and it is still expanding. It‚Äôs remarkable it hasn‚Äôt spread more geographically but the numbers are frightening and the fact that they are going up is terrifying.‚Äù The more blacks that die from Ebola the better. This will mean fewer of them getting on boats and coming to Europe. Once there all they do is rape and murder people and this is something we don‚Äôt want. We also need to pass laws banning dumbass White people who go to these areas to try and save these niggers. Those people should be arrested and charged with crimes. There‚Äôs way too many niggers around and they offer nothing positive to the world."
Alabama Legislature Passes Bill to Jail Abortion Doctors for Life,2122,"A number of southern states are passing all sorts of anti-abortion laws. This is really pissing off leftists who have adopted a pro-abortion and infanticide agenda. They endorse the slaughter of babies to their god Moloch. The most hardcore of these bills yet is the one just passed in Alabama. If signed by the governor, it would jail abortion doctors for life and make no abortion exceptions for rape and incest. The Sun: ALABAMA lawmakers last night passed a near-total ban on abortions ‚Äì including in cases of rape and incest ‚Äì while threatening to jail doctors who carry them out for LIFE. State governor Kay Ivey, a Republican, will make the final decision on whether to enact the controversial law after local senators voted in favour by 25 to six. If it‚Äôs signed off, the new law will make it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy ‚Äì punishable by up to 99 years in jail. The only exception would be when the woman‚Äôs health is at serious risk. The historic legislation is designed to go against the US Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalised abortion nationally. This means it will likely be challenged in the courts ‚Äì but if backed by the current conservative-led US Supreme court, could see abortions banned across America. I fully support any and all anti-abortion legislation. At this point, I don‚Äôt give a fuck how hardcore it is. Largely because legal abortions have paved the way for women to turn themselves into disgusting sperm toilets. It‚Äôs also been used as a means by Jews to control the White population. And if it sets up a challenge to Roe V. Wade that‚Äôs even better. Roe V. Wade is a retarded ruling that should be overturned. And this idea that overturning it would immediately ban abortions everywhere is not correct. It just means that the abortion issue would go back to the states. But this would effectively mean that abortion would probably be outlawed in more states than not. I used to not really give a shit about this issue, but I‚Äôm rabidly anti-abortion now because it serves as an effective check on destructive female nature."
Instagram Blocking Anti-Vaccine Content,2242,"Instagram has announced that they are going to be blocking anti-vaccine content. This is obviously retarded as fuck but not surprising. They‚Äôre claiming that anybody who doesn‚Äôt believe that people should be injected with unlimited vials of mystery goo is evil and promoting misinformation. The Verge: Instagram will begin hiding search results for hashtags that consistently return false information about vaccines, the company said today. Starting today, the company will effectively begin blocking access to hashtags that return misinformation designed to dissuade people from getting vaccinated. Instagram made the announcement at an event for press in San Francisco on Thursday. ‚ÄúIf the hashtag was #vaccines1234, if it contained a high proportion of known vaccine misinformation, we would block that hashtag entirely,‚Äù said Karina Newton, Instagram‚Äôs global head of public policy. (And no relation to the author of this post.) ‚ÄúKnown vaccine misinformation‚Äù refers to misinformation that has been verified as false by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, and similar organizations, the company said. Other posts that express anti-vaccine views but have not been confirmed as false could be allowed to stay up, the company said. Yeah, so these tech companies are positioning themselves as being the arbiters of all truth. Who the fuck are they to determine what is or is not misinformation about vaccines? People should be allowed to have an open debate about the subject without interference. I personally don‚Äôt trust vaccines because they‚Äôre produced by pharmaceutical companies who have a financial incentive to jab as many people as possible. And often times these shots have fucked up side effects. I also believe that vaccines could one of the causes of autism. Of course, it could also have something to do with other environmental factors, plastics or other bullshit. The problem is that the fields of medicine and science have been totally corrupted and can‚Äôt be trusted. That‚Äôs the only reason why these debates are happening. Trust has been lost and people are looking for answers. So it figures that these tech companies want to censor people who are offering an alternative view to the status-quo."
Women are Putting Garlic in Their Pussy and Yogurt in Their Asshole,1656,"Clown world is real. If it wasn‚Äôt why are women putting garlic in their pussy hole and yogurt in their asshole? An article published on Oprah‚Äôs website actually went into detail about these subjects. Oprah Mag: There‚Äôs a nasty rumor that‚Äôs been around for years that women in need of a yeast infection cure should look no further than the produce aisle. The myth states that the simple act of inserting a garlic clove into your treasured female bits will help to remedy the entirely unpleasant sensation that anyone in possession of a vagina has at some point experienced. It turns out this DIY method is actually not an effective treatment for that internal burning or itching. In fact, it can actually harm your lady garden. And that‚Äôs why Dr. Jen Gunter, OBGYN and author of The Vagina Bible, wrote a (now viral) thread of tweets to end the cycle of fake vajayjay news. At least twice a month, she tells us, her patients inform her that they‚Äôve attempted to self ‚Äúmedicate‚Äù with garlic. The legend is so pervasive, she says, because it‚Äôs a long-standing tale that‚Äôs now being further spread by resources like Our Bodies, Ourselves which ‚Äúpeople consider legitimate‚Äù and automatically believe. ‚Ä¶ And while we‚Äôre at it. Please refrain from putting yogurt‚Äîanother common DIY treatment‚Äîin your fanny, she asks. Your breakfast shouldn‚Äôt be near your genital tract. The MGTOW community has also been talking about this article. This just illustrates how utterly stupid and retarded women are without proper male guidance. They will just go ahead and shove all sorts of weird shit into their holes without thinking. I don‚Äôt even know what to say at this point."
Sri Lanka: Big Backlash Against Moslems After Easter Bombings,3419,"This story is being vastly under reported in the mainstream kike-run media but there has been a fairly significant backlash against Moslems in Sri Lanka following the Easter bombings by Islamic militants. In one city, Moslem refugees have been forced to hide as locals are now demanding their immediate removal. Guardian: At least 700 refugees from a persecuted Islamic sect are in hiding after fleeing their homes in the Sri Lankan port city of Negombo as communal tensions soar in the aftermath of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. The bombings, which killed around 253 people ‚Äì the death toll was revised down on Thursday by the health ministry ‚Äì shattered the relative calm that has existed in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka since a civil war against mostly Hindu, ethnic Tamil separatists ended 10 years ago, and have raised fears of a return to sectarian violence. A group of around 500 Muslims are being sheltered in one city, which the Guardian is not naming. There was a significant police presence outside their location and dozens of locals were protesting, calling for the group to be removed from the area. ‚ÄúThese people must be pulled out from this place,‚Äù said a local provincial council member. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want them.‚Äù Signs in English and Sinhala posted outside said: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need Pakistan refugees.‚Äù The government also conducted an anti-terror raid against Islamic militants which resulted in 15 deaths. The Hill: At least 15 people were killed late Friday during¬†a¬†raid by Sri Lankan authorities¬†at a¬†suspected¬†militant hideout on the country‚Äôs eastern coast, police said. The¬†Associated Press¬†reported that suspected terrorists linked to¬†this¬†week‚Äôs Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka opened fire and set off explosives during the raid in Sainthamaruthu, killing 16 people, including six children and six suspected terrorists. Two suspected militants are on the run, according to the outlet. Police are probing¬†a possible relationship between the civilians and¬†suspected militants. Authorities had taken a large cache of explosives,¬†detonators, ‚Äúsuicide kits,‚Äù military uniforms and Islamic State group flags from a nearby garage a few miles from the shootout. The raids come amid a hunt for the perpetrators of Sunday‚Äôs coordinated bombing attacks, which killed¬†253 people, including many worshipers attending Easter Mass services. This is how a country that hasn‚Äôt lost its sanity should react. The people are demanding the government kick out the Moslems and you have the government conducting raids. Even before the Easter bombings, there has been widespread discontent with Moslems in the country. Just last year there were a series of anti-Moslem riots. Ideally, Sri Lanka should just forcibly remove all Moslems. All these people do is cause problems. Some of the Moslems who did the Easter bombings were the children of wealthy Moslems so even if Moslems have material wealth, it doesn‚Äôt stop them from blowing people up to advance their religious ideology. They will go so far as to cause problems in countries that have a majority brown population like Sri Lanka. If they can‚Äôt integrate in a country like Sri Lanka, what makes people in the West think that they can integrate inside of our countries? It‚Äôs insane to believe that they can. All Moslems should be banned from the West and all of their mosques should be burned to the ground. If you don‚Äôt like that view, that‚Äôs just too bad."
South Africa: Mongrels Preferred White-Run Apartheid Government,1608,"There is no question that South Africa was a far better place when it was run by Whites. The so-called apartheid-era government maintained a functioning system that was much fairer to all peoples. Mixed-race mongrels known as ‚Äúcoloureds‚Äù in South Africa, even admit this. AFP: The sense of injustice has persisted to the point that several community members lament the fall of apartheid under which ‚ÄúColoured‚Äù people had neither the freedom to move around nor vote. ‚ÄúThe blacks have all the opportunities,‚Äù complained pastor‚Äôs wife Janice Jacobs, 49. ‚ÄúWe were much more comfortable during the apartheid. They would provide us a school pack with all the stationery. We had nurses in the schools. There was order and discipline. If you set a place alight, you would end up in jail. ‚ÄúThe apartheid government used to look after education, health, housing. (This) government does not look after us. I prefer apartheid.‚Äù Imagine that, these people are saying that they were better off under the apartheid government run by Whites than a government run by a bunch of Communist jungle savages. The only reason these savages took over the country was because Jewish Communists like Joe Slovo and others used their resources to agitate the blacks against the Whites. That‚Äôs what led to the rise of the Communist nigger terrorist Nelson Mandela and the fraud of the ‚Äúrainbow nation‚Äù concept. No group of people is better off under this system. South Africa should go back to the way things were during apartheid. Go ahead and try to change my mind. And try to change the mind of this ‚Äúcoloured‚Äù person in this article."
Jew Bernie Sanders Booed by Crowd of Female Niggers,2086,"One of the problems the Jew Bernie Sanders is going to have in the 2020 campaign cycle is getting niggers to vote for him. He spoke in front of an audience of female niggers and he was booed and jeered at. Washington Post: The groans erupted halfway through Bernie Sanders‚Äô appearance Wednesday at a presidential candidates‚Äô forum sponsored by She the People, a group that aims to drive up voter participation among women of color. Before an audience of about 1,700, many of them African-American and Hispanic women, the moderator asked Sanders, I-Vt., how he would handle the rise in white supremacy. Sanders spoke of fighting discrimination and running a campaign ‚Äúto bring our people together around an agenda that speaks to all people‚Äù ‚Äì then returned to a familiar message on universal health care. For many in the audience, that was insufficient. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù a woman shouted from the back, as others began to jeer and boo. The reception reflected Sanders‚Äô struggle to win support from minority voters, a problem that dogged his 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. Sanders has taken steps since to improve his outreach, including meeting with black leaders and talking more frequently about the difficulties facing minorities, but Wednesday‚Äôs event suggested the senator still faces challenges. These coons view the Jew Bernie as just another White guy and a symbol of White supremacy. They don‚Äôt understand the Jew factor involved. Much of Sanders support is actually derived from White millennial leftists. He is not an appealing figure to non-Whites. This was proven in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was able to garner more nigger votes than Sanders and his appearance at this female nigger forum has proven it again. It‚Äôs hard to say if he can overcome this and win the nomination. Especially since he folded in 2016 and let Clinton win the rigged nomination process. He didn‚Äôt even raise a significant protest after they screwed him. But man, the fact that we are even talking about such things is another sign of what a deranged circus the American political system is."
Sri Lanka Believes Islamic Militants Did Easter Bombings,1433,"The Sri Lankan government believes a group of Islamic militants were responsible for yesterday‚Äôs Easter bombings on churches and luxury hotels. WSJ: Sri Lankan officials believe an Islamist militant group was behind the Easter morning attacks on churches and luxury hotels that killed at least 290 people and wounded another 500, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told reporters. Officials had said previously that another country had warned that the group, known as National Thowheed Jamath, was planning attacks in Sri Lanka, but the warnings weren‚Äôt specific enough to effectively act on and didn‚Äôt include hotels or tourist sites as potential targets. Imagine my shock. A group of Moslems blowing up random people to advance their fanatical ideology. Who would have ever thought? The thing is, the Jew-run media is trying to downplay the premise that Moslems did this. Just like they labeled anybody a conspiracy theorist for suggesting that Moslems burned down the Notre Dame Cathedral. That‚Äôs because they have a vested interest in flooding our countries with these savages. Compare that to the narrative they pushed in the 2000s when they were selling the American people on invading Iraq. It was non-stop propaganda about the evil of Moslem terrorists. The solution to Islamic terrorism is very simple. Ban all Moslems. And for any Moslems in the country, you round them up and put them in camps so they can‚Äôt blow people up."
Ebola Doctor Shot Dead in Congo,1339,"Anybody who thinks we should send resources into Africa to help blacks with Ebola are fools. They don‚Äôt appreciate the help and we should just let them die. A doctor who was trying to help treat those infected with Ebola was just shot dead in the Congo. AFP: A health worker fighting an Ebola outbreak in DR Congo was shot dead Friday in an attack on a hospital in the eastern city of Butembo, the World Health Organization said. The WHO said that Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, an epidemiologist it had deployed to help rein in the Ebola outbreak, was killed in the attack on Butembo University Hospital. Two other people were also injured but believed to be in a stable condition, it said. The attack is the latest in a string of assaults on teams grappling with a near nine-month-old Ebola outbreak that has claimed almost 850 lives. ‚ÄúI and all of WHO are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and brother Dr Mouzoko,‚Äù WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. What is the purpose of trying to help these Africans any way? Even if you save some of them, what are they going to contribute to the world? The answer is simple. Nothing. Hopefully the Ebola virus kills as many Africans as possible. Their numbers need to be dramatically reduced otherwise they‚Äôll spread throughout the world like a locust plague."
Fear of Ebola as Congolese Caught Crossing US-Mexico Border,1496,"The mess on the southern border continues. We now have Congolese niggers invading the country and people are afraid that they are bringing the Ebola virus with them. Breitbart: A public health official in Laredo, Texas, said 20 Congolese migrants were monitored for Ebola and other diseases in shelters in his city and across the Mexican border in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Shortly after his announcement during a Laredo City Council meeting, the World Health Organization (WHO) considered declaring a ‚Äúglobal emergency‚Äù in response to a massive outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ‚ÄúWe have 8 Congolese right now in one of our shelters and a dozen in Nuevo Laredo,‚Äù Laredo Health Director Dr. Hector Gonzalez told the Laredo City Councilman George Altget during a council meeting on April 4. ‚ÄúFor them, my concern was Ebola.‚Äù He said that due to the time element, the Congolese migrants were not developing symptoms of Ebola. ‚ÄúBut, we‚Äôre on alert to check that,‚Äù he said. Since it would be racist to not let Congolese niggers with Ebola enter America, I fully support Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal to send these Congolese niggers to sanctuary cities. You see, Trump is playing 88 dimensional chess to win the 2020 election. By bringing letting in Congolese niggers with Ebola, it will kill millions of Democrat voters giving him an easy electoral victory. All of you people who are demanding Trump close the border and shoot these invaders are just not seeing the bigger picture."
New York Kikes Claim Measles Outbreak is Causing Anti-Semitism,2584,"Jews are extremely paranoid about people hating them for their behavior. The paranoia is so out of control that they are now blaming a recent measles outbreak in New York City for causing anti-Semitism to spread. Lohud: As measles cases in New York climb, leaders within the Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish community, where most cases in the metropolitan area have been concentrated, fear something else is also spreading ‚Äî anti-Semitism. With upcoming Passover travel, there is concern that both could get worse. Rabbi Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious diseases specialist and respected Jewish scholar, wrote about the dual concerns of measles and backlash recently for the Rabbinical Alliance of America. ‚ÄúWhy are precious children unnecessarily exposed to lethal illnesses?‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúHow could we cause ‚ÄòOrthodox Jews Cause Disease‚Äô to be the lead story on major print and other news media? Why are health departments and governments ‚Ä¶ talking about fining Jews and closing Yeshivas?‚Äù A headline in Der Yid, an influential newspaper published by the Satmar Hasidic community, called the anti-vaccination movement: ‚ÄúSenseless! Heartless! Torah-less and Reckless.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very scary,‚Äù said Rivkie Feiner, a Monsey resident who works on behalf of various Orthodox causes. ‚ÄúAs an Orthodox family, my kids wear yarmulkes, we are being marked.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Torah commands us to protect and preserve our health,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVaccination is unquestionably a halachic (Jewish law) obligation to protect the health of our children and ourselves and a responsibility we have towards others. There is no room for equivocation on this religious and moral obligation.‚Äù Agudath Israel of America, a major Orthodox organization, maintains that the measles outbreak is being used by the media and others as a stalking horse for anti-Semitism. ‚ÄúOur public discourse is debased when individuals and media outlets point the finger of blame for the spread of measles squarely ‚Äî and sometimes viciously ‚Äî at the ‚Äúultra-Orthodox‚Äù community. Social media comments have been particularly appalling in this regard,‚Äù said a statement from the group. Why so paranoid kikes? The fact that you go so far as to blame a measles outbreak for causing anti-Semitism to spread indicates to me that you are protesting a bit too much. Only a group of people who are up to no good would need to be this paranoid about people hating them. Maybe you kikes should fuck off back to Israel so you don‚Äôt have to worry about anti-Semitism. If not, I hope the measles continues to spread and results in the death of all your ugly rat children."
Israel Uses Live Ammunition On Palestinian Migrants,1811,"Israel has once again resorted to using live ammunition on Palestinian migrants and asylum seekers. Fox News: At least two teenagers have been killed in clashes with Israeli military as tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered at the Israeli border to mark a year of the protest movement. The latest demonstrations honored the ‚ÄúGreat March of Return‚Äù that started on March 30, 2018. Nearly 40,000 Palestinians marched to the border in heavy rain to mark the anniversary. Protesters want an end to a years-long blockade of the Gaza Strip and for refugees in Gaza to be allowed to return to ancestral homes in Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) put the number of protesters at around 40,000 and said explosive devices, stones and burnt tires were thrown over a wall in the direction of Israeli Military, according to the BBC. The IDF said they responded with ‚Äúriot dispersal means‚Äù including live ammunition. The teens, both 17, were killed and dozens of protesters were wounded, a Palestinian health official and the Daily Beast reported. They said another man was shot dead by Israeli forces overnight near the border fence. From March to December last year, 189 Palestinians and one Israeli have died during the protests, including 35 children, three paramedics and two journalists, according to the UN Human Rights Council. During that period, 6,106 Palestinians were injured. These Jews are literally killing children, medical personnel and journalists. It sounds like this is the justification the United States needs to form a coalition force with Russia to overthrow the terrorist regime of Israel in the name of human rights and democracy. All these Palestinian migrants are trying to do is seek a better life in Israel and these Jews are shooting them dead. Something needs to be done about this."
Jews Bash Yang for His Opposition to Male Genital Mutilation,1539,"Andrew Yang is against the disgusting and barbaric practice of mutilating the penis of male babies. This is another reason to join the Yang Gang. Daily Beast: Outsider presidential hopeful Andrew Yang‚Äôs latest idea is both literally and figuratively his most unorthodox yet: He‚Äôs taking a strong public stance against circumcision. The Democratic candidate revealed in a little-noticed tweet last week that he was against the ritualized practice of cutting a newborn‚Äôs foreskin. But in an interview with The Daily Beast, he said that if he were elected he would incorporate that view into public policy, mainly by pushing initiatives meant to inform parents that they don‚Äôt need to have their infants circumcised for health reasons. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of pushed on parents in many situations,‚Äù Yang said, describing pressure to circumcise a child as a ‚Äúcultural onus‚Äù imposed on families. Jews are not happy about this because their sick race thinks mutilating baby penis and having a rabbi suck the blood off of it is a normal thing. The neocon kike John Podhoretz literally called Yang an anti-Semite because he opposes this disgusting practice. Great. another anti-Semite. https://t.co/e528FQApY4 ‚Äî John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) March 19, 2019 People screaming about circumcision as mutilation to people who have been circumsised is Twitter at its finest ‚Äî John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) March 19, 2019 Jews are one fucked up race. There is nothing normal about this. Just look at this picture and ask yourself if you think this is a normal thing."
Majority of Chinese Sympathize with Brenton Tarrant,3687,"The Chinese know what‚Äôs up with the Moslems and they understand why Brenton Tarrant did what he did. Support for Tarrant is widespread on the Chinese Internet. Quartz: Brenton Tarrant, the 28-year-old Australian gunman who carried out the deadly mosque shooting in New Zealand on Friday (March 15), said in his screed that ‚Äúthe nation with the closest political and social values‚Äù to his own is China, and that he admired ‚Äúnon-diverse‚Äù nations. While Tarrant, who now faces one charge of murder, didn‚Äôt elaborate on his views of China‚Äîwhich was one of many global references (paywall) he dropped that investigators are now examining‚Äîhis hatred of Islam certainly has support from corners of China‚Äôs internet. One anonymous post (link in Chinese) on social network WeChat titled ‚ÄúThe words on the New Zealand shooter‚Äôs guns reflect the deep anxiety of European white men‚Äù‚Äîa reference to the white supremacy markings on Tarrant‚Äôs rifles, and his grievances over Muslim immigration to western countries‚Äîhas garnered at least 100,000 views at the time of writing, the maximum number of views on a post displayed by the platform. The piece lays blame on Christchurch officials for allowing the construction of mosques, and claimed this resulted in more Muslims coming to the city. ‚Ä¶ Some of the comments under the post suggest that followers of the ‚Äúgreen religion‚Äú‚Äîa sometimes derogatory term often used on the Chinese internet to refer to Islam because of the significance of the color to the faith‚Äîbrought the attack upon themselves. ‚ÄúThe green religion launches terrorist attacks everywhere, and now the attack finally comes to them‚Ä¶ Green religion is backwards, stupid, barbaric, and violent,‚Äù said one such comment. Elsewhere, on social network Weibo, many comments reflected the view that the shooting was a by-product of the West‚Äôs excessive political correctness, a perspective that has found increasing support on China‚Äôs internet in recent years as part of what‚Äôs known as the baizuo, or ‚Äúwhite left‚Äù movement, a derogatory term used to describe Western progressives that is roughly analogous to the term ‚Äúsocial justice warrior.‚Äù One Weibo user wrote (link in Chinese), ‚ÄúThis is a rare act of resistance from a white man. We need to find a way to prolong this and encourage white men to apply for all kinds of honors for the gunman, including a Nobel peace prize.‚Äù Another wrote (link in Chinese) that ‚Äúthis so-called ‚Äòdarkest day‚Äò is simply political correctness. A reminder to the greens: not everyone is willing to tolerate your outrageous actions.‚Äù The comment was a reference to remarks by New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who said the attack would be remembered as one of the country‚Äôs darkest days. It is very funny that one of them said that Tarrant should be given the Nobel Peace Prize. It just shows that the Chinese don‚Äôt give a fuck about any of this stupid ideological nonsense that is destroying the West. The average Chinaman views political correctness no different than us right-wingers do. Anglin also found a Chinese poll¬†showing that 81 percent of Chinese polled sympathized with Tarrant. 61 percent viewed it as an act of revenge and hilariously 14 percent viewed it as an act of self defense. Tarrant‚Äôs manifesto praises China for their lack of diversity and he‚Äôs not wrong. China might not be a perfect society, but they are a much healthier country because the state supports the majority racial group and there is no obsession over minority rights. They even have indoctrination camps for the minority Moslem population. Objectively speaking, this is a better system than what we currently have in the West with Jewish mass media and democracy."
Fat Actresses Taking Leading Roles on Film and Television Shows,2055,"Here‚Äôs another example showing what a sick and deranged society we‚Äôve become. Fat actresses are being given leading roles and we are told that this is something we should celebrate because its about diversity or something. AFP: Long relegated to providing comic relief or playing supporting parts, plus-size actresses are finally getting their due with juicy front-and-center roles in a sign of shifting attitudes towards diverse body types. New Hulu series ‚ÄúShrill,‚Äù which debuted Friday and is adapted from the best-selling autobiography of Lindy West, is the latest example of studios willing to depart from the tried and tested formula of slender leading ladies who have dominated the small screen since its creation. To be sure, curvy actresses like the Oscar-winning Octavia Spencer and Mo‚ÄôNique, or hip hop icon Queen Latifah, blazed an early trail starting more than decade back with a string of starring film and television roles. In more recent years, Chrissy Metz has gotten attention for ‚ÄúThis Is Us,‚Äù Danielle Macdonald starred in the Netflix movie ‚ÄúDumplin‚Äô,‚Äù while in cinema, Rebel Wilson (‚ÄúPitch Perfect‚Äù) and Melissa McCarthy (‚ÄúSpy,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù) have made themselves regular fixtures. ‚ÄúI think the American public, and probably the public in general, is not used to seeing fat women on TV,‚Äù Aidy Bryant, the star of ‚ÄúShrill‚Äù who has been a regular on late night comedy show ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù recently told Elle magazine. ‚ÄúI do think we are starting to see somewhat of a shift,‚Äù said Rebecca Puhl, a professor at the University of Connecticut where she is deputy director Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. Being fat is not something to celebrate. It means you are a lazy blob who has no respect for themselves or the people around you. In almost every situation, being fat is a lifestyle choice. So with that said, it is no surprise that Jews would push this as part of their diversity social engineering program. Anything harmful or subversive to society they will push as being healthy and normal. It‚Äôs utterly disgusting."
Israel Just Bombed the Shit Out of Gaza Again,2013,"This story is undoubtedly going to be overshadowed by the New Zealand mosque shooting spree, but the Jews just decided to bomb the shit out of Gaza again. The Jews are claiming to have hit 100 Hamas targets in what they say is a response to rockets being fired at Israelis. We hit 100 Hamas military targets in Gaza in response to the rockets they fired at Israeli civilians. Among them:
‚Ä¢ Underground rocket manufacturing site
‚Ä¢ HQ responsible for orchestrating Hamas terrorism in Judea & Samaria
‚Ä¢ Hamas center of unmanned aerial aircraft#StopHamas pic.twitter.com/Iy3DwpNpTU ‚Äî Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) March 15, 2019 AP: Cross-border fighting between Israel and Gaza‚Äôs ruling Hamas group appeared to be winding down Friday, amid reports of an Egyptian-brokered truce and Israeli media saying a misfire was believed to be responsible for the rare Gaza rocket attack on Tel Aviv that triggered the exchange. The two rockets had struck late Thursday, taking Israel‚Äôs military by surprise. Overnight, Israeli warplanes hit some 100 Hamas targets in Gaza. The army said targets included an office complex in Gaza City used to plan and command Hamas militant activities, an underground complex that served as Hamas‚Äô main rocket-manufacturing site and a center used for Hamas drone development. In Gaza, health officials reported that four people were wounded, including a husband and wife in the southern town of Rafah. There were no further details. The office building struck by Israel had been used by Hamas‚Äô office of prisoner affairs. I‚Äôm curious, but will governments and the media condemn Israel for killing these Moslems? Probably not. They will however call what happened in New Zealand an act of terrorism. That‚Äôs because when Jews kill Moslems it is an act of self defense. When Whites kill Moslems, it is an act of terrorism. The double standard is obvious. It becomes even more evident when you consider that Israel is an occupying and invading power whereas the Moslems in New Zealand are invaders."
Internet Porn is Causing Young Men to Get Erectile Dysfunction,2705,"Western civilization is totally fucked. How can one not come to this conclusion upon reading shit like this? Guardian: There is an ad campaign adorning the tunnels of the London Underground bearing the slogan ‚ÄúED IS DEAD‚Äù next to a photograph of a wholesome-looking man in his prime. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù it says in smaller writing beneath. ‚ÄúEd‚Äôs not a guy. It‚Äôs a guy thing. It‚Äôs short for erectile dysfunction.‚Äù The posters are promoting a new brand of sildenafil (most commonly known as Viagra), which we are supposed to think is slaying the problem. But, as it stands, ED is far from dead. Viagra‚Äôs core market used to be older men in poor health, but according to the latest studies and surveys, between 14% and 35% of young men experience ED. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy but true,‚Äù says Mary Sharpe of the Reward Foundation, an educational charity focusing on love, sex and the internet. ‚ÄúUntil 2002, the incidence of men under 40 with ED was around 2-3%. Since 2008, when free-streaming, high-definition porn became so readily available, it has steadily risen.‚Äù The evidence, clinical and anecdotal, is mounting that pornography use is a significant factor. Clare Faulkner, a psychosexual and relationship therapist based in central London, is among those who link ED and pornography use. ‚ÄúI now have ED clients in their early 20s,‚Äù she says. Part of the problem with pornography is that it is ‚Äúa very dissociated experience. Stimulation is coming externally, which can make it very hard to be in your body.‚Äù It also perpetuates the myth, she says, that ‚Äúmen are rock hard and women are ready for sex all the time‚Äù. Internet pornography has absolutely become a major health issue. And while I can‚Äôt say conclusively that this is the only factor contributing to erectile dysfunction among young men, it has certainly become a big problem. Many young men have become addicted to watching pornography and this is adversely impacting their ability to have normal sexual relationships. But I have a really hard time understanding how men in their 20s can have erectile dysfunction problems. I‚Äôm approaching my middle ages and I‚Äôve never had any such problems. Of course I regularly workout and try to keep myself in good physical shape. Many young men do not keep themselves in good physical shape and eat like shit so this is probably a bigger factor in their erectile dysfunction issues. Talk about an insane situation. Young men in their 20s should not be having problems getting erections. Only major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer which sells Viagra pills can be happy about this. What else can I say besides that? This world is totally fucked and when I read stories like this, it is difficult to argue otherwise."
Free Porn to be Blocked in UK,2488,"Internet pornography has become a public health crisis in many Western countries. The United Kingdom has decided that they‚Äôre going to require porn sites to get proof of ID before allowing the viewing of pornographic materials. The Sun: WATCHING free porn in Britain is about to get a lot trickier thanks to new rules that aim to protect children from online smut. As early as next month, porn sites will be required to get proof of ID from UK residents before showing any X-rated clips. That includes free porn sites like PornHub and YouPorn ‚Äì which attract nearly 2billion visits a month between them worldwide. They‚Äôll join a number of other sites in using the AgeID system, which requires users to verify their age via an official form of ID such as a driver‚Äôs license or passport. From April, when the new system is expected to launch, randy internet lurkers will be shown a non-pornographic ‚Äúlanding page‚Äù, according to AgeID spokesman James Clark. ‚ÄúWhen a user first visits a site protected by AgeID, a landing page will appear with a prompt for the user to verify their age before they can access the site,‚Äù he told The Metro. Obviously there will be ways around it by using a VPN and things of that sort, but anything to deter people from watching endless amounts of pornography is a positive. The main issue with this system is that it could eventually be used as a tool of political censorship. Although there‚Äôs already enough of that as is in the UK already. But going back to the main issue at hand, much of the pornographic garbage that‚Äôs uploaded to porn video sharing sites is repulsive and obscene. And the fact that Jews have historically been the primary promoter of pornography and smut should be enough for all Western countries to support measures to deal with this problem. They obviously want Whites to be masturbating to endless amounts of pornography instead of having sex and reproducing. Flooding us with endless amounts of Internet porn is part of the Jewish program of White genocide. Even more sick is that countries like the United States have made prostitution totally illegal while fully embracing Internet pornography. They‚Äôve created a situation where we have a hyper sexualized culture but access to actual sex has been made as difficult as possible. It should be the other way around. Prostitution should be legal and pornography should be heavily restricted. We would have a much healthier and saner society if this were to be the reality of things."
Green New Deal Estimated to Cost Up to $93 Trillion,2075,"The so-called ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù is estimated to cost up to $93 trillion. That‚Äôs an awful lot of shekels to try and solve the fake problem of climate change. Bloomberg: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs ambitious plan to fight climate change won‚Äôt be cheap, according to a Republican-aligned think tank led by a former Congressional Budget Office director. The so-called Green New Deal may tally between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10-years, concludes American Action Forum, which is run by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who directed the non-partisan CBO from from 2003 to 2005. That includes between $8.3 trillion and $12.3 trillion to meet the plan‚Äôs call to eliminate carbon emissions from the power and transportation sectors and between $42.8 trillion and $80.6 trillion for its economic agenda including providing jobs and health care for all. ‚ÄúThe Green New Deal is clearly very expensive,‚Äù the group said in its analysis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs further expansion of the federal government‚Äôs role in some of the most basic decisions of daily life, however, would likely have a more lasting and damaging impact than its enormous price tag.‚Äù When I was in elementary school back in the 1980s, I remember being told that by 1997 the ozone layer would be depleted and that we would have to wear spacesuits to go to the beach. These were all lies that never came true. What they‚Äôre doing with this climate change nonsense is no different. We are constantly told of a pending climate disaster that never comes. They claim normal weather conditions represents proof of this fake problem. Anybody who believes in this bullshit is a fool. It‚Äôs a scam to extort more taxes and money off or your labor. The fact that so many retards out there have fallen for this lie proves once again why democracy needs to be eliminated. We can‚Äôt have people with zero critical thinking skills making decisions that impact the lives of everybody in the country. These idiots literally want to spend $93 trillion on a fake problem that doesn‚Äôt exist and it would destroy the nation‚Äôs economy in the process."
Facebook Signals it Will Start Censoring Anti-Vaccine Content,2707,"The Jewish social media hell hole known as Facebook has announced that it has taken steps to start censoring anti-vaccine content. USA Today: Facebook says it has ‚Äòtaken steps‚Äô to reduce fake health news, anti-vaxx posts amid measles outbreak Facebook is considering making anti-vaccination content on its site less visible amid a measles outbreak that has reignited a conversation about preventative shots. The social media giant that‚Äôs been criticized for spreading fake news told USA TODAY it‚Äôs ‚Äútaken steps to reduce the distribution of health-related misinformation on Facebook, but we know we have more to do.‚Äù Facebook has been fighting misinformation on its platform since the 2016 presidential election after fake accounts and news stories aimed at sowing discord among users were discovered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently working with outside experts on additional changes that we‚Äôll be announcing soon,‚Äù Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Facebook, said in a statement. Stone couldn‚Äôt comment on exactly how soon those changes would be announced. Facebook told Bloomberg this might look like ‚Äúreducing or removing this type of content from recommendations, including Groups You Should Join, and demoting it in search results, while also ensuring that higher quality and more authoritative information is available.‚Äù This response follows a letter from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) partly blaming Facebook and Instagram for spreading false information about vaccine safety. So the Jewish company of Facebook is going to censor real discussion about the safety of vaccines because the Jew Adam Schiff wrote them a letter. How about we have an honest conversation about vaccines? But Jews can‚Äôt have that presumably because they want big Jewish pharmaceutical companies to continue making big profits off of people injecting all sorts of questionable shit into their bodies. Safety or health be damned. The bottom line is that we have every reason in the world to be weary of these vaccines. I mean, WTF is the point of the flu vaccine? Every year people get the flu shot and every year millions of people still get the flu. It shows that the flu vaccine is not remotely effective at preventing people from getting the flu. But since the pharmaceutical companies make billions of dollars off of it every year and are big advertisers for the Jewish media, all we get are positive stories about how great the flu vaccine is. Look at some of these stories from Google News about the flu vaccine. It‚Äôs all positive spin about the flu shot. Typically if the Jews are for something, you should be against it. So since Jews are demanding people get vaccinated for all sorts of shit, the entire industry should be questioned."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg Appears at Supreme Court,1679,"Our favorite Jewish Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg actually made an appearance at the Supreme Court yesterday. The Hill: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was back at the court on Friday for the justices‚Äô private conference. The Supreme Court‚Äôs Public Information Office told The Hill that Ginsburg was attending the regular closed-door meeting in which the justices consider requests to review cases. Ginsburg has been absent from the court since undergoing surgery in late December to remove two cancerous nodules from her lower left lung. The 85-year-old justice missed oral arguments last month while recovering at home from the surgery. Her absence marked the first time in more than 25 years on the bench she was forced to miss arguments due to her health. The court said last month that Ginsburg‚Äôs recovery was on track and that post-surgery evaluation indicated no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment was required. The health scare raised concerns among liberals about how long Ginsburg will be able to remain on the bench. Supporters are hoping she will be able to remain on the court until a Democrat wins the White House and is able to name her successor. So the old hag is alive I guess. Unless you believe in the theory that this is some type of Ginsburg body double. Of course, these types of theories festered because there was a total lack of transparency about her health. She had lung cancer surgery and wasn‚Äôt seen in public since the operation. Ginsburg is obviously going to try and stay on the court past 2020. She and the Democrats hope that a Democrat will be elected POTUS and that Donald Trump won‚Äôt be able to fill her vacancy."
"Chicago‚Äôs Jew Mayor Plans to Give $1,000 a Month to Niggers",994,"Chicago‚Äôs Jewish Mayor Rahm Emanuel could be on the brink of giving $1,000 a month to struggling Chicagoans also known as worthless niggers. ABC-7: Some Chicago families could start collecting a $1,000 check every month with no strings attached. That‚Äôs the new proposal from a task force created by Mayor Emanuel. The idea is to break the cycle of poverty. The pilot program would give 1,000 struggling Chicagoans $1,000 a month. Supporters say people could use the extra cash to cover unexpected emergencies, increase their savings and improve their health. What a waste of money this is. This is like giving an alcoholic free bottles of liquor every month. It is going to do nothing to solve the problem of poverty in Chicago. The main reason there is lots of poverty in Chicago is because you have lots of niggers there. If you get rid of the niggers you‚Äôd have far less poverty. You‚Äôd also have far less violence and murders. All of these problems are the result of niggers. Prove me wrong."
AOC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù Too Crazy Even for Nancy Pelosi,3790,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Communists are pushing what is known as a ‚ÄúGreen New Deal.‚Äù These people believe that man made carbon emissions are causing catastrophic climate changes and that everyone will die if something isn‚Äôt done about it. And because of this, they are demanding a total restructuring of our entire society. It‚Äôs all contained in the draft resolution of their ‚ÄúGreen New Deal.‚Äù They even held a press conference about it. The Americans for Tax Reform did a brief summary of what‚Äôs contained in this ‚ÄúGreen New Deal.‚Äù It‚Äôs all totally insane and they don‚Äôt have the slightest idea of how much it would cost to implement. Just look at some of what they‚Äôre proposing. Rebuild every single building in the U.S. ‚ÄúUpgrade or replace every building in US for state-of-the-art energy efficiency.‚Äù Will end all traditional forms of energy in the next ten years. The Green New Deal is ‚Äúa 10-year plan to mobilize every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since World War 2 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.‚Äù Plans to ban nuclear energy within 10 years if possible. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant within 10 years, but the plan is to transition off of nuclear and all fossil fuels as soon as possible.‚Äù Build trains across oceans and end all air travel! ‚ÄúBuild out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary‚Äù. Don‚Äôt invest in new technology of Carbon Capture and Storage, just plant trees instead! ‚ÄúWe believe the right way to capture carbon is to plant trees and restore our natural ecosystems. CCUS technology to date has not proven effective.‚Äù Mandates all new jobs be unionized. ‚ÄúEnsure that all GND jobs are union jobs that pay prevailing wages and hire local.‚Äù May include a carbon tax. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ruling a carbon tax out, but a carbon tax would be a tiny part of a Green New Deal.‚Äù May include cap and trade. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Cap and trade may be a tiny part of the larger Green New Deal plan.‚Äù How much will it cost? No estimate of the total cost of implementing the Green New deal is offered by Ocasio-Cortez. As you can see, the whole thing is nuts. It is simply not feasible to eliminate all existing traditional forms of energy over a ten year time frame. Especially when part of their plan is to phase out nuclear energy. If their plan was actually serious, the expansion of nuclear energy would be a big part of it. But somehow they think the entire country can operate entirely off of solar power and windmill farms. It‚Äôs a ridiculous proposal. Even Nancy Pelosi isn‚Äôt all that enthusiastic about it. Fox News: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled her much-touted ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù on Thursday ‚Äî a package of far-reaching, big-government proposals like health care for all, federal job guarantees and a push to eliminate U.S. carbon emissions ‚Äî but it‚Äôs already receiving shade from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ‚ÄúIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,‚Äù Pelosi told Politico on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they‚Äôre for it right?‚Äù Pelosi took a more conciliatory tone on Thursday, saying: ‚ÄúQuite frankly, I haven‚Äôt seen it, but I do know it‚Äôs enthusiastic and we welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there.‚Äù She also named Democratic members to serve on the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, but Ocasio-Cortez was not one of those members. The whole thing is stupid. It‚Äôs even dumber when you understand that climate change as it is sold to us is a gigantic hoax. It‚Äôs designed to extract more wealth from productive members of society so it can be redistributed to non-productive individuals. It‚Äôs a con designed to guilt White people into accepting increased taxes. That‚Äôs all this is."
Jews Claim it is a ‚ÄúParadox‚Äù That Holocaust Survivors Lived Long Lives,3071,"The Jewish media is claiming that it is a ‚Äúparadox‚Äù that Jewish Holocaust survivors lived such long lives. The homosexual Jew Matt Drudge even linked to this article on his Drudge Report site. Just look at the headline from Bloomberg and try not to laugh. Bloomberg: Sunday was Holocaust Remembrance Day, causing me to think about an assertion I heard from an elementary school teacher. She said that even those who survived the Holocaust were so debilitated that the rest of their lives would be short. As with many things I learned in elementary school, the reality is more complicated, and my 10-year-old self would be glad to know that my teacher was probably more wrong than right. Living through a horrendous event, like confinement in a concentration camp or prisoner-of-war camp, does create health problems serious enough to shorten most people‚Äôs lives. But those who survive also seem to have other characteristics ‚Äî perhaps a stronger immune system and a more optimistic outlook than the general population ‚Äî that tend to make people live longer. New research suggests that such resilience can often overcome scarring. The most comprehensive evidence on Holocaust survivors comes from a new analysis in the American Medical Association publication JAMA by a team of Israeli researchers. It compared Holocaust survivors born in Europe between 1911 and 1945 who later moved to Israel to people born in Palestine over the same period. The sample included more than 38,000 Holocaust survivors and a comparison group of almost 35,000 Israelis born in the territory that became their country in 1948. Data on both the survivors and the control group came from the Maccabi Healthcare Services, which¬†provides health insurance to about a quarter of the Israeli population. The entire premise of the piece is centered around Israeli research. In other words, you can‚Äôt trust any of it. And the article itself is written by Peter Orszrag one of the most Jewish looking Jews imaginable. The fact of the matter is that there is no paradox. The Jewish Holocaust of six million never happened. There were no shower room gas chambers, masturbation machines or death roller coasters. They‚Äôre all fantasies conjured up in the sick minds of Jews. The Jews were treated no different than how the United States treated the Japanese population living in America during World War II. In fact, one could argue that they were treated much better. There are all sorts of stories about football games and brothels at these camps. Deaths at the camps were largely the result of the allies destroying Germany‚Äôs infrastructure making it impossible for them to maintain them. Plus, many Jews have falsely claimed to be so-called Holocaust survivors for personal gain. Take in point the Jew who made up a bullshit story about the Holocaust but justified it by saying it was ‚Äúreal in his mind.‚Äù The bottom line is that the Holocaust is a hoax and the reason why all these Jews lived such long lives is that they did not suffer all the things that they allege. They‚Äôre a bunch of filthy liars."
Democrats are Openly Supporting Infanticide Now,2491,"The Democrat Party is literally advancing an agenda allowing for the legalization of infanticide. This after the Democrat state governors in New York, Rhode Island and Virginia advanced late term abortion agendas basically allowing a woman to kill their child after birth. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam made some particularly deranged comments on a radio show. Tucker Carlson debated the issue last night with an evil feminist cunt who cried about coat hanger abortions and women‚Äôs health. As if late term abortions are good for a woman‚Äôs health. And this isn‚Äôt just me saying it. This is what mainstream Republicans are saying all over their Twitter feeds.

At this point it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to see them try and pass laws making it legal for women to sacrifice their children to Moloch. This is pure evil we are dealing with folks. That‚Äôs all this is."
Chicago is Colder than Antarctica but Global Warming is Real!,1371,"If global warming is real, why is Chicago and much of the surrounding area colder than Antarctica? It would seem to me that this proves that global warming is not real and is a hoax. CBS: Wednesday is looking like one of the coldest days ever on record in Chicago, with the high temperature expected to be 12 degrees below zero, which would be colder than some of the most frigid places on earth. For example the South Pole is expected to reach a high temperature of 4 below zero on Wednesday. Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost point in the United States, located above the Arctic Circle, will be 7 below zero. Zackenberg Station, Greenland, which is also north of the Arctic Circle, will be 11 below. While there is no weather station on the summit of Mount Everest, you would certainly expect even the base camp would be colder than Chicago, given it‚Äôs at an elevation of more than 17,000 feet above sea level. No such luck. They‚Äôre expecting a high of 30 on Wednesday. It‚Äôs no wonder why they started using the term ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù instead of ‚Äúglobal warming.‚Äù This way they can just claim that any changes in the weather represent proof that there is an enormous crisis and the solution is to force White people to pay more taxes. This whole thing is a gigantic scam and all the people who believe in it are retarded who should be seeing a mental health professional."
Aztec Savages Bringing Disease to America,1414,"All these Aztec savages from Central America that are invading these United States are bringing disease and we are foolishly giving them free medical care. Washington Examiner: Border Patrol agents have spent nearly 20,000 hours since October driving asylum seekers to and from hospitals for medical evaluations, according to newly released Department of Homeland Security data. Since Oct. 1, 2018, the Border Patrol, which works in rural areas between border crossings, has ‚Äúseen an increase in the numbers of apprehended individuals requiring medical assistance.‚Äù A total of 2,224 migrants, primarily from Guatemala and Honduras, have been hospitalized due to health issues that could not be treated on site in the last month alone, according to a CBP statement. The department said the spike in illnesses among migrants is forcing federal law enforcement to spend less time focused on serious threats because they are facilitating hospital and urgent care trips. It‚Äôs also affecting communities that are trying to help with medical emergencies but are severely short-staffed. This situation is insane. Why are these diseased savages getting free medical care? The United States is something like $21 trillion in debt yet we‚Äôre trying to keep these worthless savages alive. Send them all back to where they came from. If that‚Äôs not feasible, dump them out in the desert and let them die a slow and painful death!"
Fox News Airs Graphic Suggesting That Ruth Bader Ginsburg Had Died,1649,"This morning, Fox News aired a graphic suggesting that the Jewish Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had kicked the bucket. Fox News just slipped in Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs obituary segment opener pic.twitter.com/PfN6ICltYb ‚Äî Chip Douglas (@AreaMan_) January 21, 2019 USA Today: Fox & Friends hosts apologized Monday after briefly airing a graphic that appeared to suggest Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. The graphic which showed a photo of Ginsburg along with the dates 1933-2019 appeared briefly before a segment on campus culture. Co-hosts Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt apologized for the error later in the segment. ‚ÄúWe need to apologize‚Ä¶A technical error in the control room triggered a graphic of Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a date on it,‚Äù Doocy said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to make it seem anything other than that was a mistake. That was an accident.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe apologize, big mistake,‚Äù Earhardt added. Yeah, a mistake but a pretty strange one. Not sure I‚Äôm buying that explanation. There‚Äôs lots of weird stuff surrounding Ginsburg. She had surgery for lung cancer and hasn‚Äôt come back to her duties on the Supreme Court. It‚Äôs very possible that she‚Äôs either dead or incapacitated because nobody to my knowledge has seen her in public. So was this meant to draw attention to all the weirdness? I mean, the media has stopped reporting on her health. The main Ginsburg related story other than this was her appearance in an upcoming Lego movie. I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I know exactly what is going on here, but how can she be allowed to continue to sit on the Supreme Court when nobody knows that she‚Äôs able to perform her duties?"
Evil Jew Ginsburg to Miss Second Week of Supreme Court Hearings,1327,"The evil Jew Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is going to miss a second week of Supreme Court hearings. The White House is even preparing for her departure. Fox News: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will miss next week‚Äôs court sessions and work from home, but her recovery from early-stage lung cancer surgery remains ‚Äúon track‚Äù and no further treatment is needed, the court announced Friday. ‚ÄúJustice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments. Her recovery from surgery is on track,‚Äù Supreme Court public information officer Kathy Arberg said in a statement. ‚ÄúPost-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required,‚Äù she said. This whole idea of judges and justices being allowed to give their opinions without being physically present at the hearings is truly bizarre. It shouldn‚Äôt be allowed regardless of rules or precedent. But we live in circus world so we shouldn‚Äôt expect anything less. They keep saying that she‚Äôs recovering etc.. but I don‚Äôt buy it. She‚Äôs in her 80s and has all sorts of health problems. If she hasn‚Äôt actually died yet, she‚Äôll be dead soon and President Trump will choose her replacement."
Jew Ruth Ginsburg Misses Supreme Court Arguments,1593,"The awful Jew Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was not present for arguments today. It is reasonable to assume that she is not doing well as she is not one to miss a court appearance. After all, her desire to kike the goyim is high. AP: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is missing arguments for the first time in more than 25 years as she recuperates from cancer surgery last month, the Supreme Court said. Ginsburg was not on the bench as the court met Monday to hear arguments. It was not clear when she would return to the court, which will hear more cases Tuesday and Wednesday, and again next week. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said the 85-year-old justice is continuing to recuperate and work from home after doctors removed two cancerous growths from her left lung on Dec. 21. Ginsburg was discharged from a New York hospital on Dec. 25. Chief Justice John Roberts said in the courtroom Monday that Ginsburg would participate in deciding the argued cases ‚Äúon the basis of the briefs and transcripts of oral arguments.‚Äù It strikes me as odd that she is allowed to give her opinion on court cases when she is not present for arguments. Why is this allowed? What other judges are allowed to work remote? Whatever the case, it is safe to assume that her health is becoming a bigger and bigger issue. If it wasn‚Äôt becoming problematic, she would have appeared at court. Here‚Äôs hoping she dies soon so President Trump can appoint another Supreme Court Justice. When this happens you will see a total and complete meltdown from the political left the likes of which have never been seen."
Jew Ruth Bader Ginsburg has Lung Cancer Surgery!,1734,"It is hard to see a situation where the Jewish Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be around much longer. She just had lung cancer surgery. CNBC: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, underwent surgery Friday to remove two malignant nodules from her left lung, the Supreme Court said. It said she was ‚Äúresting comfortably‚Äù after the surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and there was no evidence of any remaining disease. ‚ÄúCurrently, no further treatment is planned,‚Äù the court said in a statement. Ginsburg, the eldest member of the court and the senior justice of its liberal wing, underwent a pulmonary lobectomy. Two nodules in the lower lobe of her left lung were discovered incidentally during tests she received while being treated for rib fractures sustained in a fall last month. Both nodules were found to be malignant during an initial evaluation. Sloan Kettering on its website describes a lobectomy as the most common operation for non-small cell lung cancer. It is the best treatment for ‚Äúisolated lung cancer in an otherwise healthy patient,‚Äù according to the hospital. The shitlibs are in panic over Ginsburg‚Äôs health. If she dies or can no longer perform her duties, President Trump will be able to replace her with a right-leaning justice. There‚Äôs also Stephen Breyer another leftist-Jew on the Supreme Court who is 80-years-old. If Trump wins a second term, it is likely that Trump will be able to nominate a replacement for him as well. There‚Äôs a good chance Trump can shift the court to the right for many years to come. And that‚Äôs regardless of the recent actions of Chief Justice John Roberts who has started to side with the shitlibs on various rulings as of late."
Reports Suggesting Trump to Withdraw from Afghanistan,2581,"Fresh off of President Trump‚Äôs announcement to withdraw from Syria, there are reports talking about how people in the administration are bracing for a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Reuters: President Donald Trump is considering significantly drawing down troops from Afghanistan, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday, in the latest sign his patience is thinning both with America‚Äôs longest war and overseas military interventions, generally. Shortly after the officials spoke, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was quitting so that Trump could have a Pentagon chief more aligned with the president‚Äôs views. Mattis has argued for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. He also opposed the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria that Trump announced on Wednesday, a move that has bewildered allies and triggered harsh reaction from Republican allies in Congress. The Pentagon declined to comment on Afghanistan. Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the White House would not comment ‚Äúon future strategic developments.‚Äù The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thousands of the 14,000 troops could be sent home as a result of the deliberations, the disclosure of which could undermine peace efforts with the Taliban. The Jewish media is going nuts about this. They‚Äôre saying that these troop withdrawals will be a disaster. Take in point this segment on Jew-run CNN. Yeah, but a disaster for who? It‚Äôs bad for Israel but not America. There are no countries in the Middle East that have the military capabilities to attack the United States. And I couldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck what happens over there. If you are concerned about Islamic terrorists doing something in America, just ban ragheads named Mohammed from passing through immigration. Setup strong borders. It isn‚Äôt rocket science. But fuck, we‚Äôve been in Afghanistan for over 17 years now. And for what? It‚Äôs just one excuse after another as to why we have to spend billions upon billions of dollars to do endless war over there. Meanwhile we have Democrats telling us we can‚Äôt get $5 billion for a border wall. Those billions of dollars spent on war could be spent on all sorts of great things for the American people. How about infrastructure, healthcare etc.. It‚Äôs just funny to see all these retarded shitlibs shill for endless war now simply because Trump is against endless war. I remember back in the 2000s when all these same shitlibs were hopping mad about wars in the Middle East. Now, not so much."
Democrats ‚ÄúOutraged‚Äù After Obamacare Ruled Unconstitutional,2766,"After a Texas judge ruled Obamacare unconstitutional, the Democrats have become ‚Äúoutraged.‚Äù That‚Äôs right, a group of people who are permanently ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù have become ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù over this. Hard to believe right? AFP: Outraged Democrats vowed to appeal a federal judge‚Äôs ruling that could undo the US health care law known as Obamacare, saying on Saturday that they will use their new power in Congress to hold Republicans responsible and ‚Äúexpose their lies.‚Äù US District Judge Reed O‚ÄôConnor ruled late Friday that the health insurance reform, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is unconstitutional. The White House said it expects the ruling to be appealed to the Supreme Court. For now, it said in a statement, ‚Äúthe law remains in place.‚Äù But Democrats, who have seen the law survive scores of legal and legislative attacks, vowed to fight back, saying the health coverage of millions of Americans is at stake. They‚Äôre ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù over a judge ruling that a non-functional healthcare system is unconstitutional. Quite ridiculous if you ask me. Obamacare has been a scam to make productive White people pay for the healthcare of unproductive individuals. Most of these unproductive individuals are low IQ coloreds who would die of starvation if it weren‚Äôt for government assistance. Obamacare has also made healthcare impossible to afford for many people. But none of this is a surprise. We knew that they were going to appeal the ruling and it is ultimately going to be decided at the Supreme Court. POTUS thinks he can strike some sort of legislative deal on healthcare with the Democrats. This seems doubtful but whatever. The Democrats are obsessed with squeezing as much money from productive White people to pay for invading third world populations who‚Äôve had nothing to do with building this country. Blacks were merely used as farm equipment and no longer have any substantive purpose. That‚Äôs why it is hard to see a deal being struck. Obamacare is just one aspect of this awful system. There‚Äôs also the issues surrounding welfare, food stamps (EBT) etc.. And look, I‚Äôm not opposed to discussing the idea of universal healthcare. The problem is that such a system can only work if you have a racially homogeneous population of Whites who are actively contributing into it. But there‚Äôs other ways to resolve this problem. The fact that insurance companies aren‚Äôt allowed to compete across state lines has created monopolies and artificially inflated prices. That‚Äôs one of many things that should be looked at to resolve all the issues we have with healthcare. Ultimately, this issue doesn‚Äôt interest me a great deal. There‚Äôs far more pressing issues that need to be addressed like the third world monkey invasion that we continue to experience."
Obamacare Declared Unconstitutional by Texas Judge,1833,"Last year, Republicans attempted to abolish Obamacare but were thwarted in their attempts by the dead anti-American Zionist traitor John McCain. While they failed legislatively, there is now a push to permanently get rid of Obamacare in the courts. A Texas judge has just ruled Obamcare to be unconstitutional. It is a good ruling. As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018 Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018 Basically Obamacare was a scam to get productive people to buy healthcare for worthless colored people who don‚Äôt want to work. It basically made healthcare impossible to afford for many people. There were all sorts of stories about health insurance costs going up to insane levels. The whole thing was an enormous disaster. There was even an individual mandate requiring people without health insurance to pay a fine. Fortunately, this was eliminated in last year‚Äôs tax cut legislation. This case is likely to end up in the Supreme Court. The thing is Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the individual mandate was constitutional in a very ridiculous and bizarre ruling. It‚Äôs possible he will again side with the libshits on this but we will see what happens. Overall though, it is a good strategy to try and push right leaning agendas through the courts. There‚Äôs definitely going to be a better chance of getting solid rulings from the Supreme Court than getting any substantive legislation through Congress over the next two years."
Israel Claims Shooting Palestinians in the Legs is Show of Restraint,2103,"Israel is claiming that shooting Palestinian protesters in the legs is a show of restraint. These filthy kikes just don‚Äôt stop with their insanity do they? AP: Israeli forces deployed along the volatile border with the Gaza Strip have fired live rounds at rock-throwing Palestinian protesters ever since demonstrations against Israel‚Äôs long-running blockade of Gaza began in March. And for eight months, Israeli snipers have targeted one part of the body more than any other ‚Äî the legs. The Israeli army says it is responding to weekly assaults on its frontier by Palestinians armed with stones, grenades and firebombs. The military says it opens fire only as a last resort, and considers firing at the lower limbs an act of restraint. Still, 175 Palestinians have been shot to death, according to an Associated Press count. And the number of wounded has reached colossal proportions. Of the 10,511 protesters treated at hospitals and field clinics in Gaza so far, at least 6,392, or roughly 60 percent, have been struck in the lower limbs, according to Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry. At least 5,884 of those casualties were hit by live ammunition; others have been hit by rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas canisters. We‚Äôll definitely have to remember this report the next time the Jews complain about a White nation trying to protect their borders with force. The Jews were whining endlessly after the United States Border Patrol used a minimal amount of tear gas to prevent a caravan of Central American invaders from entering the country. Of course when it comes to Israel, they‚Äôre allowed to gas, shoot and kill Palestinians who try to enter their territory. And then they say that shooting protesters in the legs is a show of restraint. It‚Äôs comical considering the standard that they hold for White nations. Myself and many other people are getting really sick of this transparent double standard. Do you hook nosed rats not understand that people are catching on to your hypocrisy? Probably not considering your entire race seems to be biologically incapable of understanding this simple concept."
Three Whistleblowers Have Exposed Crimes of the Clinton Foundation,2561,"According to Congressman Mark Meadows, multiple whistleblowers have come forward exposing crimes committed by the Clinton Foundation. This fake charity organization was already exposed as an operation designed by the Clintons to accept bribes in exchange for political favors. These whistleblowers make that case even stronger. Fox News: Three people have come forward with hundreds of pages of evidence of potential wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation, including misappropriation of funds and allegations of quid-pro-quo promises made to donors during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tenure as secretary of state, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told Fox News on Thursday. Meadows, the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is also the chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations. The panel is set to hold an investigative hearing next week on the status of the Foundation case. U.S. Attorney John Huber was tasked to investigate the foundation last year by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Clinton Foundation consistently has maintained that it is a charity, and never traded on Hillary Clinton‚Äôs position as America‚Äôs top diplomat, which she held from 2009-2013. The organization has a four-star rating from the watchdog site Charity Navigator and has touted its mission ‚Äúto create economic opportunity, improve public health, and inspire civic engagement and service.‚Äù Maybe if we actually had a real justice system in the United States, there would be some action taken against the Clintons over this. But as it stands now, there is no reason to believe that they will be held accountable for any of these crimes. Hillary Clinton literally put the State Department up for sale and it looks as if she‚Äôll get away with this and all sorts of other chicanery with no consequences. Supposedly U.S. Attorney John Huber is investigating all of this but we‚Äôve heard next to nothing from his office. This despite the fact that there‚Äôs already ample amounts of evidence in the public domain to charge the Clintons with numerous crimes. Plus, the FBI actually raided the home of one of the whistleblowers. And of course we have a special counsel witch hunt operating as a fishing expedition against the President of the United States. Maybe I‚Äôm being overly pessimistic, but it‚Äôs hard to be optimistic considering the current situation. We‚Äôve known that the Clinton Foundation has been engaged in all sorts of dirty dealings for years. They‚Äôre being protected by the corrupt assholes working inside the deep state federal government system."
Nigeria‚Äôs President Replaced with a Sudanese Imposter!,1707,"A truly terrible thing has happened in Nigeria. The nation‚Äôs President¬†Muhammadu Buhari has died and has been replaced with a Sudanese clone named Jubril. This Sudanese imposter is now subverting the Nigerian government. He‚Äôs even taken over Buhari‚Äôs Twitter account and is falsely claiming that Buhari is still alive. One of the questions that came up today in my meeting with Nigerians in Poland was on the issue of whether I‚Äòve been cloned or not.

Muhammadu Buhari addressed the speculation as he met members of the Nigerian community in Poland, where he is attending the UN COP24 climate summit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the real me, I assure you,‚Äù he said, answering a question from the audience. ‚ÄúI will soon celebrate my 76th birthday and I will still go strong.‚Äù These are some very weak denials. If this were really Buhari, why wouldn‚Äôt he address the Nigerian people in Nigeria? Instead, he makes these claims in Poland of all places. This raises many questions. This is truly a terrible situation for the Nigerian people. Nigerians of all walks of life need to rise up and remove this Sudanese infiltrator from power. There‚Äôs no telling what this subversive individual might do to the country if he is not removed."
One Third of Caravan Invaders Infected with Diseases,1395,"There‚Äôs a new report stating that around one third of all the caravan invaders in Tijuana are infected with diseases. This is yet another reason to keep them the fuck out of our country. Fox News: Migrants who came with the caravan are suffering from respiratory infections, tuberculosis, chickenpox and other serious health issues, Tijuana‚Äôs Health Department warned on Thursday morning. The spokesman told Fox News that out of 6,000 migrants currently residing in the city, over a third of them (2,267) are being treated for health-related issues. There are three confirmed cases of tuberculosis, four cases of HIV/AIDS and four separate cases of chickenpox, the spokesman said. At least 101 migrants have lice and multiple instances of skin infections, the department‚Äôs data shows. Pretty disgusting. This is only going to get worse considering the unsanitary conditions that these invaders have found themselves in. Tijuana also does not have the resources to take care of them. Mexico should just arrest and deport them. The fact that they have not done this yet is ridiculous. What do they think is going to happen as the weather gets bad and they run out of resources? They‚Äôre not going to be allowed entry into the United States. But whatever, if they want to have a bunch of brown savages fighting with one another in the streets of their country, I really don‚Äôt give a shit either way."
Israel Shoots AP Reporter in Gaza,1681,"We haven‚Äôt heard much about this story have we? The Israelis shot an Associated Press cameraman along the Gaza border a few days ago as he covered the continuing Palestinian protests. AP photographer Rashed Rashid being rushed into the hospital by his colleagues after he was shot in the leg by an Israeli military sniper while filming a Great March of Return protest in Gaza and wearing a PRESS vest pic.twitter.com/u3nFjlUX39 ‚Äî Alex Rubinstein (@RealAlexRubi) November 20, 2018 Times of Israel: The Jerusalem-based Foreign Press Association called for a ‚Äúthorough and credible‚Äù investigation by Israel into the circumstances of an apparent shooting by IDF troops of an Associated Press cameraman during a protest on the Israel-Gaza border on Monday. ‚ÄúWe deplore the shooting of any journalist and urge the army to conduct a thorough and credible investigation,‚Äù the FPA said, adding: ‚ÄúWe expect serious disciplinary action if wrongdoing is discovered.‚Äù Rashed Rashid, 47, was shot in his left ankle while filming hundreds of Palestinians who were protesting on a beach by the border fence near Beit Lahia, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry said Monday. Meanwhile, we‚Äôve seen all sorts of hysterics about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudis and how this was terrible for journalism etc.. Of course, Israelis have regularly killed journalists and reporters. Yet despite that, there is nothing in the media criticizing Israel for their treatment of journalists. The reason why this is happening is because the media is mostly all controlled by Jews and they are not going to put out negative stories covering the chicanery their fellow Jews are engaged in."
UK: 17 Children Tricked Into Believing They Are Trannies,2233,"The United Kingdom is one fucked up place. The mainstreaming of full blown trannyism is some of the most insane shit imaginable. And to be pushing it on children is some of the most awful child abuse imaginable. Daily Mail: An astonishing 17 pupils at a single British school are in the process of changing gender, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Most of the youngsters undergoing the transformation are autistic, according to a teacher there, who said vulnerable children with mental health problems were being ‚Äòtricked‚Äô into believing they are the wrong sex. The whistleblower says few of the transgender children are suffering from gender dysphoria ‚Äì the medical term for someone who feels they were born in the wrong body ‚Äì but are just easily influenced, latching on to the mistaken belief they are the wrong sex as a way of coping with the problems caused by autism. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday revealed that a third of youngsters referred to the NHS‚Äôs only gender identity clinic for children showed ‚Äòmoderate to severe autistic traits‚Äô. It means that 150 autistic teenagers were given puberty blocker drugs which stop the body maturing. The teacher says she felt compelled to speak out to protect pupils, many of whom she believes could already be taking the powerful drugs and may go on to have life-changing surgery. She believes schools and some politicians have swallowed ‚Äòhook, line and sinker‚Äô a politically-correct ‚Äòfallacy‚Äô peddled by a powerful transgender lobby. The people who did this to these children should be given the death penalty. They should be executed during the half time of a Premier League match in the middle of Wembley Stadium. They can broadcast it live on the British Bullshit Corporation. If the UK had a sane system of government, we would see this happen. But instead, this type of insane faggot shit is allowed to persist. Simultaneously as this is going on, they allow Pakis to gang rape children because they‚Äôre afraid of being called racists. The UK is one fucked up place. Even when they vote in favor or leaving the European Union, the government refuses to follow through on it. Democracy is not working. They need a fascist government to takeover and commence a massive purge."
Jew Soros Partners With Mastercard to Aid Migrants,2238,"We‚Äôve been told by Jews that any talk about the billionaire Jew George Soros aiding the Central American caravan invasion is a conspiracy theory. They‚Äôve even said that any talk about Soros is code for Jews and anti-Semitic. Just as they are trying to shove this ridiculous narrative down our throats, this story comes out about Soros partnering with Mastercard to help migrants and refugees. Reuters: Billionaire investor George Soros will partner with Mastercard Inc on a venture they said could help migrants, refugees and others struggling within their communities worldwide to improve their economic and social status. The partnership, Humanity Ventures, stems from a pledge Soros made in September to earmark up to $500 million for investments to address challenges facing migrants and refugees. In a joint statement on Thursday, Mastercard and Soros said that despite billions of dollars of humanitarian and development assistance, millions of people remain marginalized, a situation the private sector can help rectify. ‚ÄúMigrants are often forced into lives of despair in their host communities because they cannot gain access to financial, healthcare and government services,‚Äù Soros said. ‚ÄúOur potential investment in this social enterprise, coupled with Mastercard‚Äôs ability to create products that serve vulnerable communities, can show how private capital can play a constructive role in solving social problems,‚Äù he added. Talk about tripping over your narratives. This is a story put out by Reuters, but there is zero coverage of it anywhere in the Jew-run press. Obviously, this is an inconvenient story that they don‚Äôt wish to feature. And look, I can‚Äôt say 100 percent if Soros is specifically behind this caravan invasion, but he‚Äôs obviously suspect number one. He financially encouraged the third world invasion of Europe and he‚Äôs one of the few people in the world who has the money and the desire to do something like this. But man, it‚Äôs really something to see this Jew who is being accused of flooding White nations with third world populations just come out with this announcement. It‚Äôs like saying, yeah your conspiracy theories about me true but you are horrible anti-Semitic people for talking about it any way."
Fat Jewess Barbra Streisand Blames Trump for Being Fat,1855,"The fat Jewess hag Barbra Streisand is blaming Donald Trump for being fat. Trump‚Äôs glorious agenda has caused her to lose sleep and eat lots of pancakes. She also said that she‚Äôs planning on moving to Canada if Democrats don‚Äôt win the House in the upcoming election. CNS News: Singer Barbra Streisand said she might move to Canada if the Democrats don‚Äôt win control of the U.S. House in this year‚Äôs mid-term election. When asked during an interview with The New York Times how she was feeling these days, she said she‚Äôs been that losing sleep. ‚ÄúI want to sleep nights, if we take the House I‚Äôll be able to sleep a little bit better,‚Äù she said. Streisand was asked what she would do if the Democrats don‚Äôt win the House. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been thinking about, do I want to move to Canada? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just so saddened by this thing happening to our country. It‚Äôs making me fat. I hear what he said now, and I have to go eat pancakes now, and pancakes are very fattening. We make them with healthy flour, though ‚Äî almond flour, coconut flour,‚Äù she said. Yeah, so she plans on moving to another majority-White country because of Trump. Figures that she can‚Äôt fly her fat Jewish ass to Israel. She‚Äôs also got a new album out called ‚ÄúWalls‚Äù that is protesting Trump‚Äôs border wall plan that is slowly coming to fruition. Of course she doesn‚Äôt have much to say about the big ass wall Israel has to keep brown Palestinians out. She‚Äôs only against walls in White countries. This story should give you even more incentive to vote in the upcoming election. If the Republicans win the House, she says she‚Äôll leave America and getting this fat Jewess Streisand out of America will be a net positive for the country. I feel bad for the Canadians that they‚Äôll have to deal with this ugly bitch, but maybe her presence will cause them to become proper anti-Semites."
Wignat Bullshit Helped Bring Down Gab and is a Cancer,4096,"Hopefully after what‚Äôs happened over the past few days, people will finally realize how retarded and dumb all this wignat bullshit is. For those of you not familiar with the term ‚Äúwignat‚Äù it stands for ‚Äúwigger nationalist.‚Äù This is basically someone who believes that the only path to victory is by becoming a real life variation of a Neo-Nazi depicted in Jewish Hollywood film productions. Many of these people will take this concept in some of the most insane and ridiculous directions imaginable. They have no coherent or viable political strategy and are a proven joke. Putting all of these theories about hoaxes and false flags aside, what happened this past Saturday represented the wet dream of many wignats and the ultimate conclusion of their ridiculous ideology. Their politics consistently revolve around showing others that they are the most hardcore among the hardcore. Many of them are mentally unstable which makes them susceptible to manipulation and psychological operations. It‚Äôs very possible that the wignat community on the social media site Gab has consisted primarily of feds trying to goad people into committing acts of violence and people with a variety of mental health problems. To recap what happened, a man named Robert Bowers went into a Pittsburgh synagogue where he shot and killed 11 Jews. He posted the statement, ‚Äúscrew your optics, I‚Äôm going in‚Äù on his Gab account right before shooting up the synagogue. His comment about ‚Äúoptics‚Äù and his belief that Donald Trump is part of a Jewish conspiracy proved that he was firmly on the wignat side of the fence. While I can understand the anger that would drive someone to do this, his actions did absolutely nothing to advance our political goals. In fact, they have been a major detriment to them. As a result of this incident, the Jews have used it as justification to smear and shut down Gab. Even though Gab had become home to numerous wignats, meth posting lunatics and feds, there were plenty of normal people who were banned from places like Twitter who actively used it. At time of writing, Gab is still offline and who knows if they‚Äôll find a way to bring it back. They‚Äôve been banned from various payment processors and services so the site‚Äôs future is very much in question. Unfortunately, this is much bigger than just Gab itself. The incident is being used by the Jew media industrial complex to justify a total shut down of free speech on the Internet. They are gleeful at the opportunity. It‚Äôs like¬†Hanukkah has come early for them. Just look at the Jew-run Anti-Defamation League‚Äôs Twitter feed if you don‚Äôt believe me. The shooter in this weekend‚Äôs #synagogueshooting apparently maintained a vile, hate-filled profile on the social media site Gab, an online hub for #extremists & #whitesupremacists. Our experts have more: https://t.co/i3GWcNnqGD ‚Äî ADL (@ADL_National) October 29, 2018 We are not going to achieve our goals by randomly murdering Jews or engaging in acts of terrorism. We are also not going to achieve our goals by dressing up like the stereotypical Jewish depiction of a Neo-Nazi and marching through the streets. Proper real life activism is great, but shit like this is retarded and serves no practical purpose. Normal people will never be on board with these things. This is just an objective fact. We have several decades of history proving it. The only way towards gaining long lasting political power is by persuading a significant majority of our people in the worthiness of our ideas. This entire debacle has made it more difficult to do this. The good news is that we are winning the battle of ideas. We just need to stay the course. Our out reach on the Internet has been hugely effective. There‚Äôs also been some good real life activism happening as well. We have no reason to engage in violence. Let the anti-fascists be the one‚Äôs to act like violent niggers. Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany because he had the support of the people. This wignat garbage is cancer and will not give us the support of the people. It is not a viable path towards achieving our goals."
Poland: Schools Cancel Activities Promoting LGBTQP Tolerance,1568,"In a major step forward, Polish schools have cancelled various activities promoting LGBTQP tolerance. Now this is what I call progress. AP: Several schools in Poland have canceled activities promoting tolerance for gays and lesbians following government pressure and threats in some places. More than 200 schools had planned to take part in ‚ÄúRainbow Friday,‚Äù an anti-discrimination event that a civic rights group, the Campaign Against Homophobia, had promoted in hopes of building greater acceptance for LGBT students. Private broadcaster TVN reported that some schools pulled out of the event following an outcry. The education minister of Poland‚Äôs conservative government, Anna Zalewska, had warned ahead of time that any principals who allowed such events to take place could face negative consequences. She also asked parents to report any such activities to authorities. Of course ending these activities is just a small step forward. Much more needs to be done because no sane person should be forced to tolerate faggots. Any man who jerks off in another man‚Äôs asshole is insane and sick in the mind and soul. There is no tolerating this madness. Poland‚Äôs government needs to replace these programs with programs that encourages children to openly hate faggots. Hating faggots is good for the health of a society. The fewer faggots in a society the healthier it is. This has been proven by many academic studies and documented in various research papers. In fact, the healthiest societies are those that actively encourage faggots to be thrown off of roof tops."
Minnesota: Republican Politicians Attacked by Anti-Fascists,2548,"Over the past several years we have seen a great deal of political polarization. In the past, the Democrat and Republican Parties weren‚Äôt all that much different from one another. Now we are seeing some distinct differences. The Democrat Party openly stands for Jewish Communism, multiculturalism, open borders and other anti-American agendas. The Republican Party is now a populist pro-America party that is being purged of fake ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù who conserved nothing. This political polarization has caused leftists to become increasingly violent and aggressive. In fact, just recently a couple of Republican politicians in Minnesota were physically attacked by anti-fascist, anarchist types. Fox 9: In a sign of how heated the fall campaign has become, two Minnesota Republicans say they were attacked and punched in separate incidents over the weekend. State Representative Sarah Anderson of Plymouth said she had confronted a man for kicking her campaign sign when he charged at her. First-time candidate Shane Mekeland of Becker said he suffered a concussion after a man punched him in the face at a Benton County restaurant. Plymouth Police and the Benton County Sheriff said they had opened investigations into the incidents. Both candidates said they were stunned by their assailants. ‚ÄúThe idea that they will physically attack me, that is un-Minnesotan, that is not how we operate, and that‚Äôs not how we solve problems in the state,‚Äù Anderson said. Mekeland said he had stopped at a restaurant Friday to ask if he could hold a campaign event there. He was talking to a few people around a high-top table when a man in the group punched him ‚Äúout of nowhere.‚Äù Mekeland said he fell backward and blacked out when he hit the floor. He said he‚Äôd been discussing health care and taxes with the man, who at first seemed to agree with his positions. ‚ÄúThe last thing I heard is him say ‚Äì I‚Äôll keep out the colorful language ‚Äì ‚ÄòYou bleepin‚Äô people don‚Äôt give a bleep about the middle class,‚Äô‚Äù Mekeland recalled. Here‚Äôs a local news clip further detailing one of the attacks. The Democrat Party and their anti-fascist foot soldiers are going to continue doing things like this. Mainstream figures in the Democrat Party are openly calling for violence unless they are returned to power. If they don‚Äôt win back power in the upcoming midterms they‚Äôre going to go completely insane which is exactly what we want. We want them to go so insane that martial law will need to be declared so these NPC terrorists are rounded up and incarcerated in FEMA camps."
9/11 Attacks Happened 17 Years Ago,6553,"Today is September 11th, 2018. This day marks the anniversary of one of the most significant historical events of our lifetimes. Even after 17 years, we still have not had a real national conversation about what happened that day. We are just told to believe the official story and to accept the insane policies of endless war, open borders and a domestic police state that have been implemented in response. There are now a significant number of people around today who were born after the attacks took place. They have no memory of what happened that day. All they hear about is the official story describing how Moslem hijackers armed with box cutters flew planes into buildings. The thing is, the official story is obvious bullshit and the real culprits who were behind what happened have never been held accountable. There‚Äôs numerous books and documentaries that have been done on the subject, but here‚Äôs a few key points that I distinctly remember from my research into the events. Roughly an hour after the attacks took place, the Jew-run media was already blaming Osama Bin Laden for what happened despite not having any evidence or proof that he was involved. Curiously enough, Bin Laden worked with the CIA in Afghanistan against the Soviets during the 1980s. The Bin Laden family was also known to have close contacts with the Bush family. So basically, Bin Laden was an asset used as a scapegoat to blame the attacks on. Around the time of the attacks, Bin Laden was reported to be in poor health and is widely believed to have died around that time. Many of the so-called Bin Laden videos that came out in the years to follow were fake as shit. Take for example this one allegedly showing Bin Laden watching television. The video was shot in such a way where the person in the video could literally have been anyone. But this was sold to the American people as a legitimate and authentic video of Bin Laden. On top of that, the official story of his death is highly questionable. They claimed that in 2010, a group of Navy Seals raided a Pakistan compound, shot him dead and then immediately dumped his body into the ocean. Obviously, they didn‚Äôt want anybody independently analyzing the body. That is of course if we are to assume that the entire ‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty‚Äù Hollywood story of Bin Laden‚Äôs alleged killing is even remotely true. The whole story stinks to high heaven and no reasonable person should believe it. There‚Äôs also little doubt that the attacks were pulled off by many Jews and Zionists. Israel and Saudi Arabia gained the most from the attacks. Even though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, the United States has gone on to only attack enemies of these countries. It‚Äôs also worth noting that George W. Bush when he was president was surrounded by pro-Israel, Zionist Jews in key positions. This is what led to the so-called ‚Äúwar on terrorism‚Äù that was really just a war to benefit Jews. Israelis with connections to the Mossad were caught filming the towers before the attacks happened and were seen celebrating them. They were arrested and turned over to the FBI but were eventually allowed to return to Israel. Keep in mind, Robert Mueller, the same asshole involved in this ongoing witch hunt against Donald Trump was the head of the FBI when they had these Zionist agents in custody. He‚Äôs a traitor for letting them go. And then you have the story of WTC-7 also known as the Salomon Brothers Building. This building wasn‚Äôt even hit with a plane, only had minor damage and collapsed at free fall speed as a result of some kind of controlled demolition. The BBC reported that the building had collapsed even though it was still standing in the background during their report. They were provided the official narrative before the event took place 20 minutes later. So basically WTC-7 was loaded with explosives before September 11, 2001 and there was some sort of coordination involved that allowed the true culprits to bring down the building. There‚Äôs no way to wire a 47-story building with explosives in a matter of hours. There are a number of theories as to why they would do this but WTC-7 housed numerous government offices before it was destroyed. It may have been done to conceal evidence of some kind. There may have been other motives involved as well. The Twin Towers were also brought down with explosives. Buildings don‚Äôt just spontaneously collapse at free fall speed because of fire damage. Take in point the Grenfell Tower in London. This building was entirely engulfed in flames and it did not collapse at free fall speed and disintegrate into dust like the Twin Towers did. Point blank, a handful of Moslem hijackers couldn‚Äôt have done all of these things that happened that day. I could go on and on about all sorts of other things like the weird military drills that were held. Or how there was no tangible wreckage of Flight 93 visible at the alleged crash site in Pennsylvania. Or how almost none of the camera footage shot at the Pentagon showing the alleged plane strike has ever been released. The footage that has been released is a joke and doesn‚Äôt provide any definitive proof of a plane hitting the building. And how the hell did anything hit the Pentagon at all in the first place? The Pentagon is arguably the most secured building in the world. Pretty ridiculous how jets weren‚Äôt scrambled or anti-aircraft defenses weren‚Äôt on high alert especially considering what happened in New York earlier. Nothing should have been allowed to hit that building let alone a passenger aircraft. So yeah, the entire story is complete and total fucking bullshit. And I just went over a small fraction of the many points that tears hole after hole into the official narrative. Yet despite that, politicians and the kike-run media acts like anybody who questions the official story is an insane conspiracy theorist. But it‚Äôs not conspiracy theory, it‚Äôs basic common sense. We haven‚Äôt even been allowed to have a real conversation about the 9/11 attacks and all the stupid policies that have been implemented. Open Borders? Endless wars against Jewish enemies? A police state? It‚Äôs utterly retarded what‚Äôs transpired in the years after this. The proper response to the 9/11 attacks would have been to close our borders and then immediately declare war against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The American government would have also rounded up all Jews and had them thrown in concentration camps. I am still hoping to see these things happen in my lifetime. Until those things happen, justice will not be served."
Evil Zionist Traitor John McCain is Dead And In Hell!!!!,2224,"I was off the grid for the past 18 hours or so and just came online to find out that the evil Zionist traitor John McCain has died and is in the pits of hell. This is the greatest news I have heard in a long time!! Fox News: Arizona Sen. John McCain, a war hero who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, served three decades in Congress and went on to become the Republican Party‚Äôs nominee for president in 2008, died Saturday. He was 81 years old. In his last hours, McCain turned down further treatment, his family announced in a statement. McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Doctors discovered the tumor during a medical procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He remained upbeat after the diagnosis, flying back to Washington days after surgery with a large scar visible above his eye to partake in the Senate‚Äôs health care debate. ‚ÄúI greatly appreciate the outpouring of support ‚Äì unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I‚Äôll be back soon, so stand-by!‚Äù McCain tweeted on July 20 after his diagnosis. While I haven‚Äôt watched any of the cable news coverage, I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôre portraying him as some type of great American hero. The people presenting him this way are liars as he wasn‚Äôt a great American hero, he was a great American piece of shit. All he did while in office was push America into stupid wars for Jews and Israel. And worse yet, he supported open borders policies despite his home state being flooded with all sorts of beaner monkeys. He even supported ISIS terrorists against Syria and sabotaged Donald Trump‚Äôs attempt to abolish Obamacare last year. Not to mention he‚Äôs been one of the loudest voices agitating for war against the Russians. There‚Äôs much more, but that basically summarizes the major points of his awful legacy. Even his status as a so-called ‚Äúwar hero‚Äù seems to have been a lie. There‚Äôs been reports documenting how his fellow POWs did not believe that he was tortured. And there‚Äôs also sufficient information to suggest that he collaborated with the Communists in exchange for preferential treatment. Whatever the case, I‚Äôm just glad he‚Äôs dead. He was a very evil man and I have no doubt that he is in hell right now."
Twitter‚Äôs Stock Plunges Over 20 Percent,2494,"The other day Facebook‚Äôs stock plunged over 20 percent resulting in a record market cap loss. Twitter‚Äôs stock suffered a similar fate today. Guardian: Twitter‚Äôs stock plunged 20.5% by the time the markets closed Friday ‚Äì the second-biggest loss for Twitter‚Äôs stock since the company went public in 2013. Almost $5bn (¬£3.8bn) has been wiped off the market value of Twitter after the social media service reported a drop of 1 million users following its action to delete fake and offensive accounts. Twitter‚Äôs shares had fallen by 15% when Wall Street opened on Friday before recovering slightly to be down 16% after investors were spooked by news that the number of active monthly users fell from 336 million to 335 million over the past three months. The San Francisco-based company warned investors to expect user numbers to fall further as it took greater action to block fake and offensive accounts. The company told investors that the drop in users reflected ‚Äúimpact from decisions we have made to prioritise the health of the platform‚Äù. It‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôre having problems maintaining their active user base. We‚Äôve said all along that banning people for their political views was a stupid business strategy. The Alt-Right was the only group of people saying anything politically interesting on Twitter. They banned us simply because Jews at the Anti-Defamation League demanded it. But the banter between the Alt-Right and our political enemies made the platform interesting and fun. Even our political enemies have to admit this. It‚Äôs obvious that they‚Äôre nowhere near as engaged now that there‚Äôs a lack of Nazis for them to yell at. On top of that, they‚Äôve gone so far as to alienate mainstream Republicans with shadow banning and other dirty tricks that effectively censor their views. This is why the government needs to regulate sites like Twitter. A monopolistic private company should not have the final say as far as who is and who isn‚Äôt allowed to participate in the pubic square. It would also prevent the type of Jewish blackmail we‚Äôve seen from groups like the ADL. Twitter ‚ÄúSHADOW BANNING‚Äù prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints. ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2018 The good news is that the President looks like he‚Äôll eventually do something about this. Restoring free speech on these big social media sites will undoubtedly be a huge help to his 2020 re-election campaign."
Wakandan Prophet Arrested After Failing to Resurrect Corpse,1181,"A Wakandan prophet claiming to have the ability to bring the dead back to life has been wrongly arrested. BBC: An aspiring prophet has been arrested in Ethiopia after he failed to bring a dead man back to life. Getayawkal Ayele had tried to revive the corpse of Belay Biftu by lying on top of him and repeatedly yelling ‚ÄúBelay, wake up‚Äù. It was not successful, and his failure enraged family members who began attacking Mr Getayawkal. He was saved when police arrived shortly afterwards ‚Äì although it did not mean he was out of trouble. Abusing dead bodies is a crime under Ethiopian law and a local police commander has told the BBC that the man, whose real job is as a health worker, is now in custody. The incident was filmed and has since gone viral on social media. What a shameful situation. The police should be held accountable for arresting this Wakandan prophet. He was obviously not given enough time to resurrect the dead body back to life. Did they think raising the dead is as easy as pushing a button? This shit takes time! The family who attacked him are the ones who should have been arrested. They were not patient and failed to let this man do his work properly."
Undocumented Child Rapes 13-Year-Old Mute Girl,1718,"A poor undocumented child fleeing the war in Syria named Reynaldo Mora has been arrested for raping a 13-year-old mute girl. Quite a shocking situation to say the least! WJLA: An undocumented immigrant is accused of raping a 13-year-old non-verbal girl at her home, but the suspect‚Äôs defense attorney claims police arrested the wrong man. Reynaldo Mora, 41, of Bethesda, is currently charged with sex abuse of a minor, plus two counts of second-degree rape. In February, the victim‚Äôs family asked Mora to babysit the special needs girl, and her two siblings, at their Kensington home. During that visit, Mora allegedly forced the victim to have sexual intercourse with him in a bedroom. Police note the victim is only able to communicate with ‚Äúgestures and writing‚Äù and has the ‚Äúintellect of a first grader.‚Äù In mid-April, the victim took an in-home pregnancy test, which came back positive. Her aunt brought her to Adventist HealthCare Shady Grove Medical Center in Rockville for further testing. Medical staff confirmed she was 11-weeks pregnant at that time. The victim would later tell investigators that Mora was the father of the unborn child.

American Suicide Rates Up 30 Percent Since 1999,2184,"Suicide rates among Americans have steadily risen since the late 1990s. None of this is a surprise considering how fucked up our society is. LA Times: More than a decade of steadily rising rates have made suicide the nation‚Äôs 10th leading cause of death and one of only three causes of death ‚Äî including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and drug overdoses ‚Äî that are increasing in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a report that examines trends in suicide at the state level from 1999 to 2016, the CDC says suicide rates have increased in nearly every state. In half the states, the agency found the rate rose more than 30 percent. In releasing the report ‚Äî the same week fashion designer Kate Spade was found dead by suicide ‚Äî CDC officials noted that more than half of those who died by suicide ‚Äî 54 percent ‚Äî did not have a known diagnosed mental health condition. A new study on suicide trends in 27 states found that many victims acted after relationship problems or loss; substance misuse; physical health problems; or job, money, legal or housing stress. Most of these suicides are by Whites and specifically White males. This is what happens when you export all sorts of entry level and blue collar jobs to third world countries. Many White males who would have otherwise been gainfully employed, were unable to find work. Then on top of that you have all the societal problems that have come from feminism and multiculturalism. Thanks to Jews and boomers, our country decided to elevate third world filth, faggots, trannies and women over the people who were responsible for building America. In order to cope with this insane situation, some turned to drugs and others to suicide. What‚Äôs comical, is that we‚Äôve been told that all of this represents great progress for our society. We are even lectured about White male privilege. If these things are true, why do we have the people who built this country killing themselves at higher numbers than ever before? This is not progress. This is representative of a country with lots of problems. There needs to be a great cultural, societal and spiritual change in order for us to get out of this mess."
Nancy Pelosi Claims Good Paying Jobs Are Not Important,1476,"Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs statements are getting increasingly more foolish. She needs to retire. The mainstream Jewish controlled media is so obviously anti-American that you‚Äôd have to be a complete fool not to notice. This past Friday, positive economic numbers were reported. But instead of giving the President credit for it, they whined about how he posted a tweet referencing the jobs report an hour before it was officially released. He didn‚Äôt even say what was in the report, he just said that he was looking forward to seeing the numbers. Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning. ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2018 Seriously, fuck these people. Trump‚Äôs tweet was not the story. The story was the positive economic news. And fuck Nancy Pelosi. That senile wax faced bitch was rambling about how having a good paying job is somehow not important. Apparently the Democrats are trying to frame a narrative claiming that Donald Trump‚Äôs economic policies haven‚Äôt worked because healthcare is more expensive. Well, healthcare is only more expensive because of Obamacare and when Trump tried to fix the Obamacare mess it was blocked by Democrats and that tumor infested corpse John McCain. The Democrats are becoming increasingly desperate. Trump‚Äôs economic policies between deregulation and tax cuts have been very successful. And if they‚Äôre going to try to blame Trump for the healthcare mess, the 2018 midterms will be a disaster for them."
George H.W. Bush Back in the Hospital,1465,"I‚Äôm honestly surprised George H.W. Bush is still alive. I had thought that after his wife Barbara kicked the bucket that he was going to be gone shortly thereafter. No such luck, he‚Äôs still alive but he‚Äôs been hospitalized a couple of times over the past few months. Guardian: Former president George HW Bush was taken to a hospital in Maine on Sunday after experiencing low blood pressure and fatigue, a family spokesman said. Bush, 93 and the oldest living former US president, will likely remain at Southern Maine Health Care for a few days for observation, said the spokesman. ‚ÄúThe former president is awake and alert, and not in any discomfort,‚Äù Jim McGrath wrote on Twitter. Some might say that it is wrong to wish death on someone. In general, you could make that argument, but there‚Äôs definitely exceptions to this. And as far as old man Bush is concerned, he is absolutely an exception. This is a man who had great power and could have used that power for good. Instead, he used his power to serve the interests of Jews and Zionism. He even talked about how great the concept of a New World Order would be. So based on all this, why the hell would any of us want such a horrible individual to continue living? He is one of the main reasons why our society is so fucked up now. Had our people with power used their power properly in the latter part of the 20th century, things would not be as fucked up as they are now. Bush 41 was a major part of all this."
Ebola is Spreading Throughout the Congo,1997,"Ebola-chan has returned! The ebola virus is back. It is spreading throughout the African nation of Congo as we speak. There‚Äôs also a campaign to vaccinate the local population with an experimental vaccine. Reuters: Health workers in Democratic Republic of Congo will begin a vaccination campaign on Monday aimed at containing an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, a spokeswoman for the health ministry said. Jessica Ilunga said 4,000 doses of vaccine were shipped on Saturday to Mbandaka, which last week registered the first cases in an urban area since the latest flare-up of the disease was announced earlier this month. Cases in Mbandaka, a port city on the Congo river, have raised concerns that the virus could spread downstream to the capital Kinshasa, which has a population of 10 million. The outbreak is Congo‚Äôs ninth since the disease made its first known appearance near the vast central African country‚Äôs northern Ebola river in the 1970s. An Ebola epidemic killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa in 2013 to 2016. It appears as if the ebola virus is just nature‚Äôs way of dealing with the overpopulation of niggers. Africa has been the only place we‚Äôve seen these ebola outbreaks. Throughout Africa you have extremely poor sanitation and the more niggers you have the worse this issue gets. While it is admittedly just a theory, I believe that ebola probably spawned from this situation. The West should quarantine these areas and let the virus do its work. This vaccination campaign is a joke. There is no benefit to the world in saving Africans from the ebola virus when the continent is already overpopulated with Africans. They‚Äôre savage creatures who are incapable of maintaining proper sanitation practices and show no desire in conserving their environmental surroundings. Not to mention the fact that we see some of these blacks overflowing into Europe where they rape and kill people. Therefore, it is logical to deduce that we need fewer niggers and not more niggers."
Texas School Shooter Shot Up School Over Dumb Slut,3141,"The Texas school shooter has been identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis. He was a bit of a weird person who wore a trenchcoat to school regardless of the weather. CBS News: The suspect in a deadly shooting rampage at a Texas high school Friday morning has been identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, officials say. Ten people were killed and 10 others wounded in the shooting Friday morning at Santa Fe High School south of Houston, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said. The suspected shooter, who was in custody, also had explosive devices, including a molotov cocktail, that were found in the school and nearby, said Gov. Greg Abbott, who called the assault ‚Äúone of the most heinous attacks that we‚Äôve ever seen in the history of Texas schools.‚Äù Police found pressure cookers and pipe bombs around the school, one law enforcement source told CBS News. Pagourtzis has been booked into the Galveston County jail and is being held with no bond on charges of capital murder and aggravated assault of a peace officer. Additional charges may follow, according to the Galveston County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. A substitute teacher and several students were among the dead, law enforcement sources tell CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton. Students described Pagourtzis as quiet and ‚Äúweird‚Äù because a long trench coat was part of his wardrobe, even on days when the temperature neared 90 degrees, CBS News‚Äô Omar Villafranca reports. Shana Fisher is the not so innocent slut whose slutty behavior resulted in¬†Pagourtzis killing her and her fellow classmates. There‚Äôs a good chance she is in hell right now. It appears as if his motivation for going on a shooting rampage was centered around him taking revenge against a slut named Shana Fisher who publicly humiliated him. Said slut seemed to give him signals that she was sexually interested in him and when he pursued her she gave him confusing signals before rejecting him in public. The slut‚Äôs mother even talked about how she thought she could be killed days before the event happened. The slut would not have made such a prediction if she wasn‚Äôt responsible for putting herself in this situation. So long story short,¬†Pagourtzis killed the slut in retaliation and a bunch of other people who he disliked. The other people were just collateral damage. His main target was the slut. Pagourtzis was also threatening to kill people weeks before the incident but I guess they let him back in school any way. There‚Äôs also no word if he was on drugs or had mental health issues. So at this point all we can say is that he was a big of a strange person. Overall though, the shooting rampage would have never happened if it wasn‚Äôt for that dumb whore playing stupid whore games and publicly humiliating him. While it was admittedly an extreme reaction, it is not advisable to fuck with strange people like this. It‚Äôs like poking a hornet‚Äôs nest. Sadly, this incident is going to be used to further gun control discussion instead of dissecting the insane slut epidemic we have around America. This despite the fact that we have a much bigger problem with sluts than guns in this nation."
Another School Shooting in Texas,1923,"There are reports of another school shooting at a Texas high school. Apparently 8 people have been killed. ABC 13: Law enforcement sources confirm to ABC13 at least 8 people are dead following a shooting inside Santa Fe High School. The Harris County Sheriff‚Äôs Office says one suspect is in custody and a second one is detained. According to law enforcement agencies, it appears the shooter is a student. The school district just issued the following statement: ‚ÄúThis morning an incident occurred at the high school involving an active shooter. The situation is active, but has been contained. There have been confirmed injuries. Details will be released as we receive updated information. Law enforcement will continue to secure the building and initiate all emergency management protocols to release and move students to another location. All other campuses are operating under their regular schedules. So far, there‚Äôs no information on who the shooter was but most likely it will end up being some crazy person that was under the influence of SSRI drugs. Either that or it will be some individual known to be capable of doing this as was the case with Parkland, Florida. Police have arrested and detained the shooter. BREAKING NEWS: Suspect involved in a shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas ‚Äúhas been arrested and secured‚Äù and injuries are reported, the school district confirmed https://t.co/sZuvdAlfHx pic.twitter.com/bFOjmkKaG8 ‚Äî Fox News (@FoxNews) May 18, 2018 Undoubtedly the Jew-run media is going to again call for gun control etc.. even though the obvious solution is to allow teachers to conceal carry and properly secure schools. The mental health and prescription drug angles should be looked at also. If we see that faggot David Hogg and that dyke spic Emma Gonzalez on television again, I think I might lose my shit. But somehow I‚Äôm sure CNN will be having them back on in light of this new incident."
Fat Kike Amy Schumer Hospitalized With Kidney Infection,1061,"The horrible fat kike Amy Schumer has been hospitalized with a kidney infection. Looks like this was divine retribution for her shitty movies and her falsely claiming that she‚Äôs White. People: Amy Schumer is recovering after spending five days in the hospital with a ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù kidney infection. The actress and comedian recently returned from her honeymoon with new husband Chris Fischer, and was in the middle of promoting her new film I Feel Pretty when the infection struck. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been up to this week. I was hospitalized for five days with a horrible kidney infection,‚Äù Schumer, 36, posted on Instagram. ‚ÄúI want to give a big thank you to the doctors, the bad ass nurses also my husband who‚Äôs name is, I want to say, Chris? And my sisters Kimby and Mol who have been by my side the whole time.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the garbage movie that she was promoting before she was struck down with the kidney problems. I wish nothing but bad things for this fat Jewish cow. Hopefully she remains in the hospital permanently so she doesn‚Äôt put out any more shit films."
George H.W. Bush Hospitalized,1509,"George H.W. Bush the evil Zionist who waged wars for Jews when he was President of the United States appears to be close to death. Dallas Morning News: The day after he buried his wife of 73 years, former President George H.W. Bush, 93, was admitted to the hospital with an infection, a spokesman for the family said Monday. Bush was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital on Sunday morning after contracting an infection that spread to his blood, according to the family. ‚ÄúHe is responding to treatments and appears to be recovering,‚Äù Monday‚Äôs statement said. The former president has had health problems in recent years. In April 2017, he was hospitalized with pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. A few months before that, he was treated at Houston Methodist for 16 days for pneumonia. This is a man who could have done great things for the United States and the American people had he chosen to do so. He was the Director of the CIA, Vice President and President of the United States. He was entrenched in the power structure for decades. It‚Äôs a real shame that he decided to serve the interests of Jews and the international Zionist power structure. The Gulf War and his constant talk of a New World Order are arguably the most prominent pieces of evidence proving his loyalty to the Jews. But now that he is close to death, you have to wonder what‚Äôs going through his mind. Whatever he‚Äôs thinking, he should be prepared to spend an eternity in hell. Based on what he did on this planet he deserves no less."
Israel‚Äôs Defense Minister: ‚ÄúNo Innocent People‚Äù in Gaza,1391,"Everyone in the Gaza Strip is guilty and needs to die according to the Jews. The kike Defense Minister for Israel Avigdor Lieberman is saying that there are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip. His logic being that every person there is connected to Hamas so they‚Äôre all guilty and must be killed. Arab News: Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Sunday there were ‚Äúno innocent people‚Äù in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip after 10 days of protests and clashes left 30 Palestinians dead. ‚ÄúThere are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip,‚Äù Lieberman told Israel‚Äôs public radio. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs connected to Hamas, everyone gets a salary from Hamas, and all the activists trying to challenge us and breach the border are Hamas military wing activists.‚Äù Israel has faced mounting questions over its use of live fire after 10 days of protests and clashes along the Gaza Strip border in which its forces have killed 30 Palestinians, according to Gaza‚Äôs health ministry. Make no mistake about it, this kike would slaughter all the millions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. He does not care if they are man, woman or child. The Jews think anybody who isn‚Äôt a Jew is cattle deserving of slaughter. How the kikes treat the Palestinians is how they‚Äôd treat everyone else in the world if they had the power to do so. They are a plague on the planet and have been since the beginning of recorded history."
US Blocks UN Call For Investigation Into Israeli Killings in Gaza,2247,"Human rights violations do not apply when Jews are committing them. The United States has for the second time blocked a call from the United Nations Security Council to investigate the numerous deaths and injuries that have been occurring on the Gaza-Israel border. Haaretz: For the second week in a row, the U.S. administration blocked a UN Security Council statement over the weekend that called for an investigation into clashes on Israel‚Äôs border with Gaza that left nine Palestinians dead. 29 have died since Palestinian protests began last week. The statement, proposed by Kuwait as the representative of Arab countries on the council, expressed sorrow over the deaths of innocent protesters and urged the body to open a transparent internal investigation of the events. Nine Palestinians were killed by Israeli army gunfire after clashes resumed between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces along the Gaza border on Friday, Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry reported. The dead include photojournalist Yaser Murtaja, who was shot in the chest while wearing a vest marked ‚Äúpress.‚Äù The U.S. blocked a similar statement last week, after clashes on the border between Israel and Gaza left 15 Palestinians dead. Earlier Saturday the European Union released a statement saying the deaths on the Gaza border raise ‚Äúserious questions about the proportionate use of force.‚Äù The Jews even shot and killed a Palestinian reporter who was wearing a vest that said ‚ÄúPRESS‚Äù on it. The Jews claim that it isn‚Äôt their policy to shoot reporters but since Jews lie all the time we can safely assume that it is in fact policy to do just that. It certainly doesn‚Äôt benefit them if the goyim see images and video of Jews shooting unarmed people in an open air concentration camp. Some of the footage is pretty crazy.¬†The Palestinians have dubbed this the ‚ÄúGreat March of the Return.‚Äù They‚Äôre lighting tires on fire to obscure the view of the kike border guards while the kike border guards are just shooting and gassing people indiscriminately. It‚Äôs pretty disgusting that the U.S. continues to support these evil kikes. The entire world hates these individuals. They‚Äôre evil and what they‚Äôre doing in the Gaza Strip is reprehensible and hypocritical on so many levels."
Crazy Woman Shoots Up JewTube‚Äôs Headquarters!,2646,"Some crazy woman went into JewTube‚Äôs headquarters and shot a bunch of people then ended up killing herself. It looks like she might have been angry at her boyfriend who worked at JewTube and went there to shoot him. The specifics of what happened are still being sorted out though. Daily Mail: A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube‚Äôs California headquarters on Tuesday, wounding three people before killing herself as terrified employees huddled inside. The female shooter, who was wearing glasses and a scarf at the time, shot her boyfriend before turning the gun on herself on Tuesday, according to witnesses. Law enforcement sources told multiple outlets that the shooting was linked to a domestic incident. Officers and federal agents swarmed the company‚Äôs headquarters complex in the city of San Bruno just before 1pm after dozens of panicked employees called 911 to report gunfire. Upon arrival, police found the woman dead inside the campus with self-inflicted gunshot wounds. San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said three people were taken to hospitals in San Francisco with gunshot wounds. When I first heard that this happened I thought it was some angry Vlogger who got their channel banned by JewTube kikes. This was not at all what I expected it to be. But even before we know all the specifics of what happened we have retards on Twitter saying they‚Äôre going to use the incident to demonize the National Rifle Association and demand the Second Amendment abolished. Take for instance this Michael Ian Black faggot. Another shooting.
I'm going to politicize the fuck out of it, and so should you.
The NRA is a terrorist organization. https://t.co/UsoQBIxWpf ‚Äî Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) April 3, 2018 If we are to look at this incident objectively, it sounds to me that this bitch who did this was completely insane. She should have been in a mental hospital. Of course in Northern California, mentally ill people are allowed to roam the streets even if they are harassing or attacking people. They have a huge problem with mental health and the idiots running the state don‚Äôt have any desire to fix it. In fact, if you are clinically insane you might be asked to serve in the state government and receive a six figure salary. But no instead of fixing these problems, it‚Äôs easier for these morons to blame guns and the NRA. It‚Äôs all about making political points instead of offering solutions. They are not serious people and do not want these problems resolved. I‚Äôd also say there is a 50/50 chance that California‚Äôs Governor Jerry Brown was dropping acid and listening to Grateful Dead records when this happened."
Trump‚Äôs Plans for a Military Parade Criticized for Logistics and Costs,2489,"So the President wants to hold a military parade and he‚Äôs being criticized by kikes in the media and even some clowns from the Pentagon over this. Comically they‚Äôre whining about costs and logistics. LA Times: Pressed by President Trump, the Pentagon is proposing to stage a military parade in November with veterans in historic uniforms and warplanes, but no tanks ‚Äî a scaled-down version of the grand display of military might the president envisioned, according to a memo released by the Pentagon on Friday. Veterans in ‚Äúperiod uniforms‚Äù from past wars would march from the White House to the Capitol on Nov. 11 ‚Äî Veterans Day ‚Äî joined by ‚Äúwheeled vehicles only, no tanks,‚Äù to ‚Äúminimize damage to local infrastructure,‚Äù the planning document says. Trump asked the Defense Department to plan a parade of the U.S. armed forces to celebrate military strength, much like France‚Äôs annual Bastille Day parade that he and First Lady Melania Trump attended in July in Paris as the guests of French President Emmanuel Macron. But Pentagon officials, citing the cost, logistical difficulties and rarity of large-scale military parades in the United States, have sought to shift the focus to celebrating American history and the contributions of veterans, and away from displaying military hardware and row after row of marching troops ‚Äî a scene more associated with autocratic nations, from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to, in the present age, Russia and North Korea. Costs and logistics? How come we never heard about these types of problems when we were spending trillions of dollars to wage wars in the Middle East to benefit Israel? Holding a military parade is good for morale. The costs are minimal and logistics can be figured out. If the military can figure out how to get a bunch of military hardware over into the Middle East to bomb the shit out of Arabs, they sure as hell can figure out how to roll some vehicles through the streets of Washington DC. When he first started talking about this idea, this same type of criticism was all over CNN and MSNBC. Here‚Äôs just one example. In a healthy society, a military parade is good for the spirit and pride of the nation. People have just been jaded with the military because it has been used to fight dumb ZOG wars for decades. Even though Trump hasn‚Äôt done everything 100 percent perfectly, he‚Äôs at least trying to re-establish some form of normalcy. The parade should move forward, especially since all these fools are against it."
NRA and Trump Have Productive Meeting,1919,"Last night the President met with the National Rifle Association. Both sides agreed that it was a productive meeting. I had a great meeting tonight with @realDonaldTrump & @VP. We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don‚Äôt want gun control. #NRA #MAGA ‚Äî Chris Cox (@ChrisCoxNRA) March 2, 2018 Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018 People have been angry at the President because of comments he made about possibly raising the age to buy an AR-15 to 21 and suspending due process allowing police to seize guns. Obviously I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think either of those things are going to come to fruition. I think this was just noise for media consumption since they were foaming at the mouth demanding something be done with guns and the NRA. The thing is, the Jew-run media went overboard with their demands. Everybody could see that the Florida school shooting happened because of massive law enforcement failures. It had nothing to do with the Second Amendment or the NRA. Interest in joining the NRA has skyrocketed and they pissed off millions of people by using two of the most obnoxious teens imaginable to push this message. The criticism has been so strong, that big social media sites have been actively censoring material that has expressed negative opinions of them. Numerous videos calling out David Hogg as a crisis actor or a script reader have been frantically removed off of YouTube. But either way, it‚Äôs good to see that the NRA and the President had a productive meeting. Based on this, I do not think anything substantive will happen with gun control. There‚Äôll be a focus on pushing concealed carry in schools, improved mental health infrastructure and enhancing the background check system."
California Rated Last in Quality of Life,1307,"The world depicted in the 1990s film Escape from L.A. would probably offer a better quality of life than what we see in much of California today. California was just rated last in state rankings measuring quality of life. This is not a surprise considering California has embraced Jewish Communism. USA Today: Here‚Äôs a nugget that won‚Äôt make the welcome pamphlet: California has the worst quality of life in America. At least that‚Äôs what U.S. News & World Report‚Äôs most-recent Best States rankings say. The Golden State ranked 50th in quality of life by fairing poorly in the natural and social environment categories. The report, released Tuesday, ranks states based on a healthy environment and a sense of community. It takes into account each state‚Äôs urban air quality, pollution and voter participation, among other measures. This is just another example proving that Jewish Communism is designed to destroy societies. California has high taxes, a high cost of living, endless amounts of third world filth, homeless encampments in cities, rampant crime and all sorts of other problems. It is a terrible place to live. These horrible policies have all been implemented in the name of tolerance and political correctness. These are not tolerant policies. They are policies designed to destroy and corrupt."
California Has Become a Third World Shithole,1879,"California is a shithole country. California has some of the most beautiful natural surroundings in the country, but unfortunately the cities throughout the state have devolved to third world status. There are illegal aliens, drug addicts, minorities and all sorts of subhuman filth infesting them. Fox News: The specter of homeless encampments steadily expanding across the downtown streets of San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco ‚Äì bringing with them a public health crisis ‚Äì has one southern California community taking tough action to dismantle a two-mile-long camp just a short drive from Disneyland. In a departure from the approach taken by other local governments in the state, officials in Orange County, Calif., have started to clear out the camp ‚Äì by moving occupants and hauling away literally tons of trash and hazardous waste. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming part of the permanent landscape in those communities and there is no way we are going to allow Orange County land that is supposed to be used by residents to be occupied by the homeless,‚Äù said Todd Spitzer, who sits on the Orange County Board of Supervisors. I maintain that California is like a weird mix between the 1990s science fiction movies ‚ÄúDemolition Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúEscape from LA.‚Äù It is truly a bizarre place. And how can anybody think that the Communist inspired policies implemented in California have been good? They‚Äôve obviously been a disaster. It has taken a state that many people wanted to live in and turned it into a shithole. What‚Äôs sad is that the people there are fighting to continue these stupid policies. At this point, we should definitely encourage California to secede from the United States. #CalExit should be fully supported. This will marginalize the Democrat party. Then after a few decades or so when California becomes a failed state, we can send in terminator styled robots to retake it."
Antifa Recruiting the Mentally Ill,1929,"An anti-fascist group in Texas is apparently recruiting mentally ill persons to join them. This is not a surprise as being mentally ill is a requirement to join any anti-fascist group. Daily Caller: A Texas Antifa student group hosted a six month health program to ‚Äúpoliticize‚Äù students with ‚Äúmental illnesses,‚Äù according to a Thursday report. The Revolutionary Student Front at the University of Texas at Austin hosted a ‚ÄúRevolutionary Mental Health Program‚Äù ‚Äúto address the mental health needs of students in a way that would primarily serve to politicize and strengthen them, to become more committed to revolution and more capable of carrying it out,‚Äù reported Far Left Watch. The UT Austin Antifa student group based its 2017 program on ‚ÄúTurn Illness Into A Weapon,‚Äù a book charting the neo-Marxist Socialist Patients Collective group‚Äôs actions in Germany, which placed the blame of mental illness on capitalist oppression. The Revolutionary Student Front sought to create a health care system that not only treated students for their mental illnesses, but also mobilized them to fight capitalism. ‚ÄúThe primary method of combating the symptoms of mental illness that we face under capitalism must be organizing those suffering to come into violent class conflict with the system that creates their illness,‚Äù said the group in its 13,000-word manifesto. The group also admits at one point that members of its own leadership suffer from ‚Äúmental illnesses.‚Äù Anti-fascist groups are domestic terrorist organizations that need to be shut down by the federal government. They do crazy shit because they are crazy people. The fact that they are admitting to their own insanity is a small victory. But seriously, these groups claim to be against the establishment yet they do everything to ensure that the corrupt Jew-run establishment remains in power. One can only imagine how much Jewish money has been flowing into these groups."
Millennials to be the Fattest Generation Ever,1741,"Pictured above is Heather Heyer the late millennial woman who died in Charlottesville last year because she was disgustingly fat. Sadly, many other millennial women are just as fat as her. It looks like it isn‚Äôt my imagination that young women are fatter and more disgusting than ever. Millennials are apparently on track to be the fattest generation ever. RT: Millennials are on course to become the fattest generation on record. A staggering three-quarters of ‚ÄòGeneration Y‚Äô will be obese or overweight by the age of 40. Despite fad diets and Instagram health stars shooting to fame among the health-trend generation, the majority are actually putting themselves at serious risk, new figures show. An over-indulgent culture has been blamed on the rising weight of people born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s. So much for the avocado trend sweeping the ‚Äòfood conscious‚Äô age group which guzzles down quinoa. After tweeting about it. This is obviously a real problem. We have a society that has taught an entire generation to be weak instead of strong. This is also a generation that was not taught how to properly deal with failure. The end result has been a generation filled with weak willed people who can‚Äôt stop stuffing their face with food. They don‚Äôt seem to be keen on exercising either. It‚Äôs one thing if we have a few overweight men here and there. It‚Äôs a whole other thing to have overweight women. This is not an acceptable situation. No respectable White man wants to fuck a fat White woman. We might just have to put these people in concentration camps to get them to lose weight. If not that, maybe we can send them down to Venezuela for a few months. They seem to have quite the effective weight loss program there."
Florida School Shooter Nikolas Cruz is a Racial Jew,4101,"Turns out that the Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz had a Jewish mother which makes him a biological Jew. This does not bode well for the White supremacist terrorist narrative that has been pushed by the Jew-run media. Generally speaking, CNN is a Jew-run fake news propaganda outlet. There are however rare occasions where they accidentally do legitimate reporting. This appears to be one of those occasions. They did a report dissecting Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz‚Äôs social media and Internet activities. While most of the report is them comically trying to paint Cruz as a White supremacist terrorist, there is one item of great interest. The article talks about how Cruz admitted that his mother was a Jew which makes him a racial Jew. CNN: The bio on one of his Instagram accounts read, ‚Äúannihilator.‚Äù At one point in the chat, he wrote, ‚ÄúI think I am going to kill people.‚Äù After a member told him not to say things like that, he said he was just playing. During one of the anti-Semitic rants in the chat, Cruz spoke of his birth mother, saying, ‚ÄúMy real mom was a Jew. I am glad I never met her. So it looks like Cruz was some type of weird Jew-spic hybrid. If so, it‚Äôs no wonder why he was crazy. But this revelation that he‚Äôs a racial Jew totally undermines this retarded narrative about him being a White supremacist. The Jew-run media parroted a hoax the Anti-Defamation League pushed about Cruz being a member of the White nationalist oriented Republic of Florida group. The media has been desperately trying to save face after it turned out that this was not true. We also see the Jew-run media and the Communist left is blabbering about gun control, when the real problem is mental health and a failure of our systems. There was no reason in the world why he shouldn‚Äôt have been placed in a mental hospital. Deputies were called to his house 39 times over the past seven years. NY Post: Before Nikolas Cruz carried out his mass killing at a Florida high school this week, police responded to his home 39 times over a seven-year period, according to disturbing new documents. Details about the calls to the Broward County Sheriff‚Äôs Office ‚Äî obtained from police records by CNN ‚Äî were not immediately available and it was impossible to determine if all involved Cruz. But the nature of the emergencies at his Parkland home included ‚Äúmentally ill person,‚Äù ‚Äúchild/elderly abuse,‚Äù ‚Äúdomestic disturbance‚Äù and ‚Äúmissing person,‚Äù KTLA reported. And a schoolmate, Brody Speno, told the network that cops were called to Cruz‚Äôs home ‚Äúalmost every other week.‚Äù ‚ÄúSomething wasn‚Äôt right about him,‚Äù Speno told CNN. ‚ÄúHe was off.‚Äù He was even reported to the FBI yet they did nothing. NY Post: The FBI was warned last month that Nikolas Cruz was an armed psycho who might shoot up a school ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt bother investigating, the agency admitted Friday. ‚ÄúA person close to‚Äù Cruz called the agency‚Äôs tipline on Jan. 5 and reported the 19-year-old had a ‚Äúdesire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts‚Äù and there was ‚Äúpotential of him conducting a school shooting,‚Äù the FBI said in a statement. But the agency said it failed to pass on any of that information to its Miami field office, even thought its own protocols say he ‚Äúshould have been assessed as a potential threat to life.‚Äù A little over a month later, on Wednesday, Cruz allegedly gunned down 17 people at his former high school. Yeah, maybe if the FBI was actually focused on legitimate law enforcement activities instead of conspiracy theories about Russia, this whole situation could have been prevented. It is certainly not legal to threaten people with death on the Internet. This story illustrates a total failure of our systems. There is no reason to believe that if you see something and say something that the government will do anything. There needs to be a massive purge at the FBI. Anything less is unacceptable. The whole situation is insane but it is hilarious to see the Jew-run media trying to claim that a racial Jew was actually a violent White supremacist. Good luck making that stick!"
Evil Spic Shoots Up Florida High School ‚Äì Kills 17,1534,"The big news of today was a shooting rampage in a Florida High School by an evil spic named Nikolaus Cruz. Early reports indicate that he killed 17 and injured many more. USA Today: A former student went on a shooting rampage at a Florida high school on Wednesday, leaving 17 dead while panicked students barricaded themselves inside classrooms and frantic parents raced to the scene. The gunman, who was expelled, was identified as 19-year-old Nikolaus Cruz. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Cruz was armed with ‚Äúcountless‚Äù magazines and an AR-15 rifle. Cruz was taken into custody miles from the school nearly two hours after the shooting started. Flanked by officers, the suspect was escorted into a police station wearing a hospital gown. ‚ÄúThis is catastrophic,‚Äù Israel said. ‚ÄúThere are really no words.‚Äù There‚Äôs still lots we don‚Äôt know, but as expected the Democrat Communists are already using this to claim we need gun control. Guns are not the problem. The problem is multiculturalism and all the mental health problems our country has. Plus, America as a society is just sick and degenerate. All of these factors have resulted in these mass shootings. The horrible society we have causes some people to randomly snap and kill lots of people. There‚Äôs already stories coming out that he was a troubled person and nothing was done about him. If that proves to be the case, we need to ask why nothing was done. There are additional rumors that he was associated with anti-fascist groups but that has yet to be confirmed."
San Francisco Opens Heroin Injection Sites,1434,"San Francisco would be a nice city if it wasn‚Äôt for all the subhuman filth and degenerates that live there. One of the reasons it has attracted such horrible people is because of their insane policies that are inspired by Communist and Marxist doctrines. Take for example this idea. Fox 59: The San Francisco Department of Public Health has unanimously endorsed a task force‚Äôs recommendation to open what could become the nation‚Äôs first legal safe injection sites aimed at curbing the opioid epidemic. The facilities provide a safe space where people can consume previously obtained drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl, under the supervision of staff trained to respond in the event of an overdose or other medical emergency. They also provide counseling and referrals to other social and health services. Although the often-controversial facilities are not an ideal solution, they are a necessity in light of the skyrocketing number of deaths caused by opioid overdose in the United States, according to San Francisco Mayor Mark Farrell. ‚ÄúI understand the misgivings around it and some of the rhetoric from people who don‚Äôt support it,‚Äù Farrell said last week. ‚ÄúBut we absolutely need to give it a try.‚Äù So they‚Äôre going to setup so-called ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù for people to inject heroin into their veins. This is a stupid approach. A much better approach is the Trainspotting method. Lock these junkies up in a room and don‚Äôt let them out."
White House Aide Beating His Ex-Wives is Top National News Story,2484,"So Rob Porter a White House aide has resigned his position after news broke that he beat his ex-wives. The Jew-run news media is trying to use this story to go after Chief of Staff John Kelly. The Hill: White House chief of staff John Kelly is under fire for defending a senior aide who resigned this week amid allegations of domestic abuse. Kelly and other senior White House officials heaped praise on staff secretary Rob Porter, one of the administration‚Äôs first hires, even after multiple news outlets published on-the-record accounts from his two ex-wives alleging that he had physically assaulted them. The White House continued to defend Porter ‚Äî who resigned on Wednesday ‚Äî after pictures were published online showing one of his ex-wives with a black eye. She claims that Porter hit her while they were on vacation in 2005. Kelly issued a second statement late Wednesday night saying he was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù by the new allegations but stood by his initial praise of Porter and insisted that he should have an opportunity to defend himself. I honestly couldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck if this man beat his ex-wives. Knowing how the vast majority of women behave, many of them deserve to get beat every now and then. This is certainly not something a man should lose his job over. Of course, in our fucked up society that‚Äôs been over run with Jewish and feminist garbage, you can lose your job for all sorts of retarded reasons. The bottom line is that this should not be a national news story. Clearly, the Jew-run media is using this to try and make a case for why Kelly should be forced out. It is unlikely that this will work. Its impossible for Kelly to know every thing about another man‚Äôs personal life. But even if he did know about this, I couldn‚Äôt give a shit. In a normal society, a man would be able to discipline his wife when she gets out of line. Obviously I don‚Äôt endorse beating up women for no reason. That‚Äôs insane and not something a healthy society should condone. But domestic violence laws prohibit a man from being able to control his wife when she steps out of line. If Porter is the crazy angry maniac as he‚Äôs being portrayed as, why did these women marry him? Did they not realize there was something wrong with him before they wed? What‚Äôs most likely is that they did something to piss him off and they got into a fight and he beat them up a bit. Big fucking deal. Either way, this story is stupid and it will be quickly forgotten in the days and weeks to come."
A Straight Edge Lifestyle is the Best Lifestyle,3723,"We will not be able to defeat the Jews if our people are abusing drugs and alcohol. The Jew-dominated pop culture of the past several decades has been responsible for pushing some of the most unhealthy and bizarre lifestyles imaginable. Binge drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, drug use, homosexuality, race mixing and other weirdness have all been promoted as trendy and cool. They have promoted these things because they are ultimately destructive to us as a people. We need to reject this garbage. The Jews want us to be weak and they certainly do not want us to be strong. If we are to have a successful cultural revolution moving forward, we need to ensure that we take care of ourselves. We won‚Äôt be able to defeat the Jews if our people are plagued with substance abuse problems. Strong men are what is needed to purge the Jew parasite from our nations. This is why I fully endorse and suggest that everyone maintain a straight edge lifestyle. The term ‚Äústraight edge‚Äù originated from a subculture of punk music to describe people who don‚Äôt use drugs and alcohol. Specifically, the term was coined from a 46 second song released in 1981 by the punk band Minor Threat. There are different extremes and variations of what this actually means, but to me it is simply a lifestyle choice where you choose not to pollute your body with crap. I get that when you are younger it is normal to experiment with things. It is true that drugs and alcohol are usually among them. The issue comes when you let them control your life. I‚Äôve seen many people ruin themselves because they failed to control their drug and alcohol consumption. The amount of human potential that has been wasted as a result of this is not easily measured. Like many others, I did some minor experimentation of drugs and alcohol when I was younger. By the time I got into my early 20s, I realized that these things were not adding value to my life. That‚Äôs when I started scaling back my consumption of these things to the point now where I won‚Äôt even drink alcohol. In fact, I honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a beer. It‚Äôs been years now and I can say with great confidence that I don‚Äôt miss it in the least. Admittedly, I‚Äôve adopted a fairly puritanical stance on this and I‚Äôm not going to condemn someone who wants to have an occasional drink every now and then. As a grown man, that‚Äôs a decision for you to make. What I will say is that going fully straight edge has been a very positive lifestyle change for me as an individual. Being straight edge gives you a solid foundation to accomplish tremendous physical feats. You‚Äôll have much more energy and this will enable you to improve yourself. It is certainly much easier to achieve results at the gym when you are not hung over from a night of binge drinking. You‚Äôll also be a much more productive individual as a result. Heroin has destroyed the lives of millions of our people.¬† Think of all the human potential that was lost because our people chose to inject this garbage into their veins. As a young man, you should be constantly testing yourself and pushing the limits of what your body is capable of. You can do this much more easily if you are not polluting your body with things that are not good for you. Ultimately though, the decision of what you put into your body is yours and yours alone. All I can say is that going straight edge has been one of the best lifestyle decisions I have made for myself. It is a lifestyle choice that I believe each and everyone of you should consider. Being straight edge opposes everything that the Jews have tried to push on us. This is perhaps the most important aspect of why I feel so strongly about promoting a straight edge lifestyle."
Feds Probe Apple Over iPhone Slowdown Conspiracy,3054,"The problems with Apple are continuing. The federal government is now investigating them over the iPhone slowdown conspiracy that they admittedly engaged in. Bloomberg: The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple Inc. violated securities laws concerning its disclosures about a software update that slowed older iPhone models, according to people familiar with the matter. The government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private. The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it‚Äôs too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow. Spokesmen for Apple and the government didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. The news comes several weeks after Apple admitted to slowing down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to make their internal batteries last longer. Apple released a software update early in 2017 to start throttling older iPhones, but didn‚Äôt specify that the action slowed the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern. The slowdowns only occur when the iPhone‚Äôs battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the old battery with a new one. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount. Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the spring with new features that allow users to monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company. After apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. U.S. government officials, including Senator John Thune have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns. So Apple is getting sued by all sorts of consumer advocacy groups and now the feds are probing them. This is not going to end well for them. This is what they get for not engaging in honest business practices. When Tim Cook the moronic faggot took over the company, he thought that he could sustain and grow the company by selling unlimited smartphones. Apple employed dirty tricks like this battery chicanery to ruin an iPhone‚Äôs performance after a period of time and force people to buy a new smartphone. It‚Äôs a very cynical business model but it‚Äôs the only way Apple could push unlimited smartphones down everyone‚Äôs throats. Smartphones are a commodity product now. It‚Äôs old technology and they‚Äôre spending all their internal resources developing weird bells and whistles for these smartphones that nobody wants. This is what happens when you put homosexuals and women in charge of companies. They fuck everything up. ¬†"
CNN Claims Getting Cucked Will Help Your Marriage,741,"CNN published an article on their website by a Jew named Ian Kerner claiming that getting cucked will help your marriage. It references a study that the pro-porn faggot Dan Savage was involved in. This is obviously one of the sickest and most insane things imaginable. Having some nigger fuck your wife is not going to improve your marriage. This is as ridiculous as someone saying that shooting yourself in the head will improve your mental abilities. Unfortunately, this is what happens when Jews are allowed to control and run media operations in our countries. CNN as we have documented over and over again is infested with Jews at all key positions in their organization. Not much diversity here is there! These kikes need to be gassed."
GRIDS Rapper Eminem Says a ‚ÄúTurd‚Äù Better Than Trump,1718,"There‚Äôs a 50/50 chance that Eminem has caught GRIDS from gay nigger sex. The middle-aged GRIDS infected looking rapper Eminem is desperately trying to start a fight with Donald Trump. He just said that a ‚Äúturd‚Äù would be a better President than Trump. Billboard: ‚ÄúWatching the TV in fucking disbelief. I was in my basement, on the phone back and forth with friends like, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs going to fucking win‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI called it just from the rallies he was having when he first started running. Because just watching the impact he has, they were fanatics. There is something to be said about the person who really felt like he might do something for them ‚Äì and he just fucking duped everybody.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know that Hillary [Clinton] had her flaws, but you know what? Anything would have been better [than Trump]. A fucking turd would have been better as a president.‚Äù It couldn‚Äôt be any more obvious that Eminem is culturally irrelevant. Rap music itself does not have the cultural prominence that it once had. All of that nigger shit peaked sometime in the late 1990s to early 2000s. Admittedly, Eminem was a big part of that era and became popular because he pushed boundaries and was politically incorrect. Now, he‚Äôs trying to re-brand himself as a Trump bashing anti-racist even though all the cultural momentum is against him. It‚Äôs really an insane thing to watch. Trump hasn‚Äôt even acknowledged Eminem‚Äôs insults which is causing him to go crazy. He just hasn‚Äôt realized how culturally insignificant he‚Äôs become in his older years. Oh well, he‚Äôll probably be dead of GRIDS soon. He‚Äôs previously admitted to using the dating app GRINDR and he looks like shit. There are people inside a cancer ward that look healthier than him."
CNN‚Äôs Paki Doctor Says Trump is at Risk for Heart Disease,666,"So after the President received a clean bill of health from a highly respected military doctor, CNN brings on the Paki street shitter Sanjay Gupta to refute his claims. He specifically claims that the President will get heart disease within three to five years. This despite the fact that he did not examine the President and is not a cardiologist by trade. He is in no way qualified or in a position to make such an analysis of the President‚Äôs health. This is retard level propaganda. When can we gas this horrible propaganda network off the air? Trump should order the IRS or the FCC to come up with some shit on these assholes so they can be raided and shut down."
