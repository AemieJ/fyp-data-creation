Minority-Run Austin Health Dept Keeps Covid Vaccines From White People For White Privilege,546,"The Austin, Texas health department has decided to put everyone but white people in the front of the line for a covid-19 vaccine. The health department released these guidelines on who will be prioritized for a vaccine. They determined that “people of color”, meaning black and brown, would be entitled to vaccines over whites. The health department insinuated a privilege of being white and being less at risk of coronavirus for the reason. (do you appreciate conservative journalism?

Italy And Iran’s Free Healthcare System Causing Mass Deaths From Coronavirus,631,"Right now the two countries effected with the worst kill rates from the Coronavirus are the countries with socialized medicine. And it’s wrecking havoc on them. The fatality rate in Italy and Iran, both countries that proudly boast Medicare for all, are skyrocketing in the percentile range over those countries without medicare for all. It’s a disaster for the countries, and their death rates have surpassed even that of China’s. So far the only two deaths in the US were two men with pre existing medical conditions in their 50s and 70s. Every other Coronavirus patient is either in stable condition or has made a full recovery."
Bernie advances socialist healthcare even as it fails coronavirus patients worldwide,7372,"
 Bernie Sanders and the other presidential candidates want fully open borders, even as the Coronavirus wrecks havoc on the outside world. Bernie said on stage that he wants to allow all who come into the United States, and that there should be no border security. He said he would abolish ICE if elected. This is as the Coronavirus wrecks havoc elsewhere and infected continue to flee into other states. The Coronavirus is barely penetrating the United States, thanks largely in part to President Trump’s strong stance on border security. The virus has been unable to cause an endemic in the United States, even as it spreads elsewhere through the world. The us has seen all known cases to have so far lead to full recovery. Others meanwhile remain in stable condition from the virus. A left wing Harvard professor was charged this month with spying for the Chinese Government. Charles Lieber taught at Harvard University in Boston. he was arrested and after being arraigned in Boston federal court, released on $1 million bail. His arrest is a result of his dealings with the Chinese government. He has not explicitly been charged with espionage yet. But he has been charged with lying to federal department of defense investigators on his dealings with the Chinese Government. lieber was the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department, so his arrest has sent shockwaves through the academic community. Lieber received secret payments of $50,000 a month, plus bonuses, to help China setup a chemical research lab in Wuhan, China. Wuhan is where the new coronavirus plague began. The Harvard-WUT Nano Key Lab was established by Lieber in Wuhan. In April, 2018 he was approached by FBI investigators who asked him about the Wuhan research lab. He said he was unfamiliar with it, and had never been asked for anything by the Chinese government. This was a lie though, and he now faces federal charges. Wuhan is ironically where the coronvirus broke out at. It’s now infected over 75,000 people worldwide. Israeli intelligence officials came out publicly to accuse China of biologically creating the virus. Virus outbreak grows The Coronavirus continues to spread, and it seems now that containing it is not an option. There’s a number of reasons for this. The virus has a long incubation period. It’s being found out now that many people can go infected without even realizing it for a number of days or weeks. The virus also seems to stay with people or come back even after someone has been infected. Because of this, people an walk around infecting others without even realizing it for weeks. The other problem is that it is apparently highly contagious. It doesn’t take much contact to get someone infected. People are becoming sick in places where they don’t even have a record of coming in contact with an infected. It’s been speculated that the Coronavirus was created at a lab in Wuhan. Ironically, China’s only biological research lab for handling weaponized viruses is in Wuhan, China. Recently a professor from the United States who specializes is viral research was charged by the federal government with lying about his work at the laboratory. All signs point to a fact that says the virus was man made. It’s also been exposed in media that the lab there in Wuhan has gotten in trouble before for selling animals that had been experimented on to local markets. An illegal way to make extra cash. Regardless if this is the cause of the outbreak or not, this shows the security lapses at the facility. The virus will not cause mass death. But it will cause mass economic hardship. Putting large numbers of people out of work will have crippling effects on the economy. And this may have been the intended effect all along. Bernie wants to remove the healthcare system defeating Coronavirus America is in the middle of an important election this year. And the stakes have turned deadly. We’re faced with a possible pandemic, not see on earth in over a century. And we need strong leadership to face it. Bernie is looking to be the nominee for the Democrats. Him being President would be disastrous. Senator Sanders spent a good portion of his life as what some may call a loser. Could not keep a job, could never pay rent, always had his utilities turned off. And this was during the 60s and 70s when things were much more affordable. In fact, he lived his life as a revolutionary drifter up until 39. Then he found a way to get paid for being lazy. It was as Mayor of Burlington. Since then, Bernie has been both a Burlington mayor and a vermont Senator. He hasn’t done anything but vocally voice support for communist dictators in the 80s and 90s..he also visited the Soviet Union where he was recorded singing communist songs naked and drunk.

Sanders was never taken serious until the past two or three weeks. Now he’s being seen as the front runner for the Democrats and potential nominee. Time will tell if he’ll actually be it. But if he is, then America will have to decide if it wants to take such a deadly risk in electing him. liberal media contributes to panic Across the globe, the media spreads panic about the Coronavirus. But it’s fatality rate is small. If you are already healthy, your chances of dying are slim to none. And for the United States, we’re leading the globe in recovery. While other countries struggle to contain the virus and treat infected, the US already has a whopping 100% recovery rate. Meanwhile, countries with socialist healthcare systems are facing brutal fatality rates, like those in Iran and Italy.

90 Yr Old Man ‘BEGS’ For Hospital Bed For Dying Wife As Irish Public Health System Crumbles,1754,"

 The Irish Hospital Consultants Association has called on the government to declare a state of emergency last week, due to the crumbling state of their national healthcare. The association went on to call public Ireland’s hospital system “third world,” , which is funded by the government as a medicare for all plan. in spite of an annual budget of over €16 billion, doctors with the association compared conditions in emergency departments like those found only in the “third world”, with the numbers waiting for hospital beds breaking records for a 2nd day in a row last month. The vice president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said it was time we “just put our hands up and declare a national emergency”. Recently a story broke of a 90 year old man begging hospital staff in Ireland to give his dying wife a bed, who lay for hours unattended in an ambulance. It’s led many in Ireland to fear even going to the hospital. It took the hospital over 90 hours from the time she arrived at the hospital suffering from a stroke to be moved to the appropriate ward for stroke victims. She spent hours just waiting outside the hospital in the ambulance. their daughter, Ms Walshe, whose dad spent nearly 20 hours on a corridor trolley last year at CUH, said her father was this time battling for his wife to get appropriate care. “The saddest part was my father, who is nearly 91, was begging and pleading at the desk, asking for my mother to get a bed,” she said. The result was seen this month in their elections, where the political arm of the terrorist group the Irish Republican Army won the elections with the most votes. This is the first time in Irish Republic history that Sinn Fein, the IRA’s political arm, will rule the country.

The cruel multi billionaire who made a name out of telling others how to live has now outdone everyone on an extreme level. Bloomberg was caught on video dated back in 2011 in which he said that it’s better off for the sake of saving money to let a 95 year old with a chronic illness go die, and tell them so. “Go have a nice life,” is what he’d say if a 95 year old came to him and he sat on the death panel. The tyrannical leader who banned large sodas and smoking indoors in people’s private commercial property has said some big brotheresque things in the past. He recently was exposed as saying that Government has a right to infringe on people’s freedoms, and has spent millions to take Americans’ guns."
Bernie’s healthcare plan would cost $70 trillion annually,937,"Senator Bernie Sanders, the communist turned socialist turned democratic socialist from Vermont, wants universal healthcare. And he wants it to replace private insurance nationwide. But how he would pay for it and how much it would cost has been a question that’s raged for the last 4 years. Now, the costs for such a plan have come out: $70 trillion. That’s right, $70, trillion. Annually. All of the nations billionaires aren’t worth $1 trillion. So how is going to pay for such a plan? You guessed it; the middle class. Like every plan the Democrats have for expanding government. The middle class would see their taxes raised drastically to pay for universal healthcare. Some as much as 20-30% more on average. CNN said 3 week ago that a plan like Bernie’s would come at the tune of $60 trillion, but that number has since been refuted as too low based on new calculations. You can see even liberal CNN’s analysis of the plan though."

The Democrats Want To Run Our Healthcare But Can’t Even Run Their Caucus,2941,"Democrats will go to sleep not knowing who won the Iowa caucus on Monday night because of a fancy new app that was supposed to be used to track voting. The app has malfunctioned, much like the Obamacare website, causing the entire system to meltdown and chaos to ensue throughout the state. The democratic party has said that they are conducting “quality control,” and that everything is fine. They will not give the press nor the campaigns any answers though as to what the problem is. Rumors are abound that Joe Biden has done horribly tonight and this is the reason for the delay of results being released. It’s quite an embarrassment for a political party that is campaigning on promises to expand government by two or three times the size it is now, along with government spending. While many Americans argue that the government is already way too big, every single Democratic candidate running for President disagrees. This includes having the government take over healthcare. BIDEN CAMP RELEASES STATEMENT 10:50pm, Iowa The Biden campaign has released a pretty cranky letter by the wording of it and basically told the DNC that he’s not going to wait around for them to release the Iowa results. Dana Remus, Biden’s general counsel:  “I write on behalf of the Biden for President Campaign regarding the considerable flaws in tonight’s Iowa Caucus reporting system. The app that was intended to relay Caucus results to the Party failed; the Party’s back-up telephonic reporting system likewise has failed. Now, we understand that Caucus Chairs are attempting to — and, in many cases, failing to — report results telephonically to the Party. These acute failures are occurring statewide. We appreciate that you plan to brief the campaigns momentarily on these issues, and we plan to participate. However, we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released. We look forward to hearing from you promptly. In the meantime, we are on to New Hampshire, on the road to the most important election of our lifetimes.” 10:30pm Horrible turnout recorded The Democrats are starting to worry as the results come in of voter turnout, and it is not looking good for them. Previously, Democrats predicted a record turnout for the caucus. But this wasn’t the case. What’s ironic is that the Democrats have touted a predicted record turnout as proof of a blue wave for November against Donald Trump. This would appear to not be the case. And on top of this, only 1/3 of caucus goers were first timers for the Democrats, much less than 2016 when almost half had never caucused with the Dems before. Democrats hoped to break their record turnout ever which was in 2008. Back then, 240,000 people caucused in the Democratic primary in Iowa. Early predictions for this year are at most, 170,000."
Number Of Working Dialysis Machines in Venezuela Plummet As Healthcare System Falls Apart,1729,"In Venezuela, in the state of Lara, around 300 existing dialysis machines for renal patients in all their units, between 25 and 30% of them, that is, between 75 and 80, approximately remain inoperative, due to different reasons , but, in most cases, it is because some parts have been damaged, and the parts are not available, because they are imported, ”said Héctor Daniel Colmenárez, coordinator of the Foundation of Friends of the Renal Patient of Lara State ( Fundaprel).
Currently, the government strictly regulates the importation of health supplies, with most orders being denied, and even knowing that hundreds of people depend on them to improve their quality of life and prevent future complications. Colmenárez explained that “we held our first working meeting in this city, where various aspects related to the different problems we experienced by renal patients in Lara state came to light.” He explained that, there, it was concluded that “the biggest problem we are facing right now is that, since last year, many of the renal patients of Lara state are, or are, receiving our dialysis rations minimized” . 
-And why? Well, simply because, as said before, an estimated 25-30% of dialysis machines in this federal entity are inoperative, most of them due to lack of spare parts. And then, what is happening? … Well then it happens that, in order to be able to dialyze all the renal patients of this federal entity, which are approximately 1,350, then simply, in the dialysis units, they are forced to reduce duration of each serving, which usually has to be four hours each, just two hours or two and a half hours. This, of course, is seriously affecting the health conditions of many kidney patients in Lara state."

After the first surgery, she languished in the hospital for so long, her family become worried she was becoming institutionalized and brought her home to live until her second operation. ‘From July to October there was talk of another operation and then between November and December there were three or four postponements and she was becoming so institutionalised we decided to get her home until an operation was certain. ‘It was a blessing because although neither of is could have guessed it – it gave us a last month together. ‘Nevertheless, she was unable to take proper nourishment and went into the operation on the better side of a low state – she was very weak.’  Mike Mackrory, a fellow Liberal Democrat councillor, said: We were all stunned to hear she had died after the operation. There were constant delays she had to endure before surgery. ‘We were given the very sad news and as word spread it threw a pall over the civic dinner. Margaret was much loved and respected in this town.’  A spokesman for Broomfield Hospital said it could not comment on individual cases. see also:"
Study Suggests Most Democrats Not Breastfed As Babies,812,"a study recently conducted has come to the preliminary conclusion that most Democrats are not breastfed as a baby. The study was part of a wider polling conducted by Prntly’s polling team across all 50 states and speaking with thousands of voters. The preliminary findings conclude that while most Republicans were breastfed as a child, most Democrats were not. “This study shows that there is now scientific backing behind why Democrats have a lower iq than Republicans. Democrats also have been shown to have more mental health issues than Republicans, along with more substance abuse issues.” Said Prntly CEO Alex Portelli. Breastfeeding has been linked to higher rates of intellect in a child and is considered essential for full child brain development. The study results will be published later this summer"
Empire Falls: How Trying Socialism Destroyed A Capitalist Success Story,9315,"“Who was the merry wag who crowned the State as the Empire State? New York would certainly raise a monument to his memory, but he made his grandiose gesture and vanished forever.” New York State. Almost immediately after it’s birth into statehood, the “breadbasket of America” saw it’s economy and population skyrocket. Despite rugged cold winters and it’s northern climate, it’s Laissez-faire capitalist principles established by followers of Capitalist Godfather Adam Smith caused it to prosper. Up into the beginning of the 1800, industry and jobs boomed in the state. Between 1820-1920, New York lead the world in manufacturing. Through the 1800s it had the largest state population in the United States. Up until 1925 it was the most populated city on the planet Earth. The state’s first governor, small government proponent and Democratic-Republican George Clinton, would also be it’s longest serving one at 7 terms, setting the groundwork for a Empirical success story. Hundreds of universities were built in the span of just a century. It had the most factories in the world. The largest population. The most prosperous and wealthy citizens. It produced more food and textiles and machinery than any other place on the planet. There was little government. Little government regulation. Few taxes. No income taxes. No public education system. And yet it produced the world’s smartest individuals by today’s standards. And it was safe. From Staten Island to Niagara Falls. The state was an Empire. And then it began to stray. New York’s collapse is not a fast one. The effect of socialism are not overnight. Just as the effects of Capitalism are not always what you see, but what you don’t see. It is the “invisible hand” that Adam Smith would reference. New York had none of the problems it has today. There were no zoning laws, and people built businesses out of their homes that would go on to become world companies. The state collects billions in income tax dollars now, compared to $0 that were collected from the 1700s up until 1919. Now it collects more money than ever from it’s remaining citizen’s income, yet has more problems than ever. It spent nothing on public education for the first half of it’s history as a colony and state. Now it spends the most in the country, yet New York’s education system is in full collapse. Students leave school unable to be self-sustainable citizens, and crime is a rampant among young people throughout modern day New York. New York once lead the country in entrepreneurs. It now leads the country in heroin use. There are few jobs today. New York’s economic outlook was ranked the worst in the country by the end of 2020. And to solve this, the current Governor, Andrew Cuomo, wants to go even further socialist than the most socialist state in America by most standards has gone; raising the state income tax on the remaining wealthy residents up to 14%. The state continues to spiral, and yet things continue to decline. New York’s steep rise, along with it’s slow and bloody fall, could be separated in two eras. The rise of New York culminated from it’s statehood in 1788 to the 1920s when it’s final skyscraper boom was complete. It is at this time that the “Empire” begin to collapse. At first a slide. Then a freefall. The largest change to the state policies happened during something called the “progressive era.” The Progressive Era started as a movement in 1896. It is just as the name would suggest: idealistic socialists who wanted to help create a utopia where there is no poverty, nobody goes hungry, and everyone can have worker rights and high wages. 

 

 Muckracking started becoming popular at around 1900, where journalists would write about issues ranging from child labor to unsafe work conditions to urban poverty. A magazine called McClare’s, founded in NYC in 1893, began regularly publishing progressive propaganda against big business, and poverty. Another was a book called “The Jungle” by Uptain Sinclair, who we have likely all heard of. This book was written in an attempt win over the public’s hearts with regard to worker conditions in meatpacking factories, but instead disgusted the public over alleged unsanitary work conditions. The results caused the Pure Food And Drug Act to be passed. This act ironically was so overly regulatory, it put most of the small meatpacking companies out of business, with only the largest able to survive the massive regulation, creating a corporate meatpacking socialist monopoly we see today. Sinclair quipped about this with a quote “I aimed at the public’s heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach.” The companies that rose through New York’s capitalist age or opened locations there had been plentiful: Avon, General Electrical, Beech-Nut Baby Food, Kodiac Films, Wonderbread and IBM. Old relics of the capitalist manufacturing mecca that New York held like Beacon Hat Mill, Split Rock Quarry, Silo City, Jumping Jack Power Plant, the Widow Jane Mine, Mt Taurus Quarry, the Dennings Point ruins, Former hotels, resorts, amusement parks and zoos like The Pines, The Erie Canal Village, Catskill Game Farm, the Abandoned frontier town, Grossinger’s Resort, and thousands more. All now sit empty, void of life and a slave to nature as she retakes what was once hers. The flight from New York is so bad now, that it quite literally is causing more deaths due to the excess number of deer taking over the abandoned outskirts of towns and cities. The deer population is exploding in parts of the state, causing a record number of traffic accidents and killing countless people. Just a byproduct of the effects of devastating policy.   The destruction of capitalism in New York is comparable in terms to failed socialist states like Venezuela, Cuba, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Soviet Union, Somalia, and others. But it wasn’t just private corporations and the wealthy that left the state though. Medical ingenuity thrives best in wealthy and prosperous societies. With the collapse of New York’s capitalist market and it dived head first into socialism, so too did their world class hospitals. Hundreds of the world’s most advanced medical facilities saw their ability to stay in business disappear, and they closed. Rockland Hospital, Roosevelt Island Hospital, Creedmore Hospital, Hudson River State Hospital, the J.N. Memorial Hospital. The list of abandoned infrastructure mounted into the thousands. This did nothing to get New York to turn away from their socialist ways. If anything, it only accelerated. As for the blue collar worker who the Democrats that preached socialism, they suffered the most, as always in a Democratic Socialist takeover. Overall, 1.2 million fewer people were employed in manufacturing in New York State in 2014 than in 1970, equal to 12.8% of the private sector employment total in 1970.  In two metropolitan areas (Binghamton and Utica-Rome), manufacturing job losses were about one-quarter of private sector employment in 1970, while in Buffalo and Rochester the manufacturing losses were about 20% of the total. Poverty is rampant in the state. From parts of Long Island to neighborhoods of Niagara. Having laws that were meant to be revolutionary for tenants has created a collapse in real estate investment and landlords. Developers by and large left the state decades ago, as the government passed sweeping tenant reforms that were the most anti property rights in the country. As a result, the supply of new housing dwindled and the State tried providing a solution. But this too ended in total failure. New York has the most extensive and costly public housing system per capita in North and South America combined. And it is crumbling. Rolling blackouts, heating and water failures, crime all plague socialist housing projects throughout the state. Public Housing in New York accounts for the most crime in the State. And unlike when the state relied on capitalism to provide housing as demand required, and let the market adjust itself, the socialist utopia the state created for housing has only continued to expand. Instead of stepping away from the disasters of socialist housing, the progressives in the state want even more money spent on it. Daily News recently published an article calling for billions of dollars to be spent on socialist housing in the state. The state has also always been ahead of the country in terms of setting a government bar on minimum wage. Even though minimum wage is a proven failed econony policy, the Socialist state continues to expand it. And every time New York would raise it’s minimum wage over the past century, the state’s economy would get a little worse. Strangely, New York continues to raise it more, not realizing the inflation it causes. Comparing a video of New York City in it’s capitalist heyday to New York City today is a tragedy. The vibrancy and bustling trade of economic activity is gone. Replaced by poverty, homelessness, no selling or buying on a mass scale occurring at all, buildings and shops empty, and houses vacant.  Thanks to this, the oppressively draconian lockdown measures from the government in New York in response to covid were all the state needed to accelerate it’s death. RIP New York. Another lesson that Socialism doesn’t work, even if it’s Democratic Socialism. "
Places That Don’t Lockdown Have No Difference In Covid Deaths Than Those That Do,3536,"A year into the Covid-19 epidemic, we are learning much more than we originally thought about the virus. The biggest thing though is that study after study is showing that the mask mandates and economic tyranny lockdowns don’t actually work. Even on far left totalitarian news outlet MSNBC, an analyst made the statement that places like Florida with no statewide mask mandates or state shutdowns of private businesses have the same number of covid cases as those with the strictest mask rules and harsh lockdowns, like California. And have less cases even than New York, with the harshest anti-covid measures in place. Watch below as the man who’s actually IN CHARGE of Federal covid response to Coronavirus doesn’t have a clue what is going on, one year in. And then FEE recently published a collection of 3 studies worldwide that were the first to actually assess whether lockdowns worked in combatting coronavirus. None did. They highlighted three studies, shown below ; A study published on July 21 in The Lancet, a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal founded in 1823, indicated that government lockdowns were ineffective. Researchers collected data from the 50 countries with the most cases and found lockdowns were not associated with mortality reductions in critical COVID-19 cases, although factors such as obesity, smoking, and life expectancy were. “…government actions such as border closures, full lockdowns, and a high rate of COVID-19 testing were not associated with statistically significant reductions in the number of critical cases or overall mortality,” the study concluded. Similarly, a study published by Frontiers in Public Health several months after The Lancet paper found neither lockdowns nor lockdown stringency were correlated with lower death rates. Researchers crunched data from 160 countries over the first 8 months of the pandemic, testing numerous factors—such as public health, demographics, government policy, economy, and environment—to determine how each correlated with COVID-19 mortality. “Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate,” the researchers concluded. Research from Tel Aviv University published in October on the website medRxiv said that strict lockdowns may not save lives. Researchers analyzed mobility data collected from iPhones and found no statistical association between lockdown severity and the number of COVID-19 fatalities. “We would have expected to see fewer Covid-19 fatalities in countries with a tighter lockdown, but the data reveals that this is not the case,” the researchers explained. In a May Bloomberg article titled “The Results of Europe’s Lockdown Experiment Are In,” data journalist Elaine He shared several visuals based on work done by the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, which tracked a range of government stringency measures across Europe. COVID mortality, He said, did not appear to be associated with lockdown stringency. “While not a gauge of whether the decisions taken were the right ones, nor of how strictly they were followed, the analysis gives a clear sense of each government’s strategy for containing the virus,” He writes. Public health officials believe they can manage a virus through effective central planning, but this is folly and hubris. Human behavior and action are incredibly complex, far too complex for bureaucrats and political officials to control through policy directives (many of which are prima facie senseless)."
Nicolás Maduro’s regime admitted that it cannot buy vaccines against the coronavirus,2123,"Written by our venezuelan correspondent.

The Venezuelan dictator justified himself based on the economic sanctions that take away resources from Venezuela, which would prevent him from buying antidotes Nicolás Maduro’s regime was open on Wednesday to allow a private sector to operate for immunization against COVID-19 in Venezuela, as a way to counteract the “blockage” of resources that, according to it, has complicated the purchase of vaccines.

“It could be (…) in the middle of the battle against sanctions it would not be bad,” Maduro said at a press conference when asked about a private market for vaccines against COVID-19 that in Venezuela accumulates 133,927 cases and 1,292 deaths.

The dictator thus entrusted the Presidential Commission for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19, headed by the executive vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, carried out a study together with the Ministry of Health to evaluate the possibility of allowing the private market for vaccines. Maduro repeatedly denounced that Venezuela has resources blocked in the United States and, although to a lesser extent, other countries, which has complicated the purchase of vaccines to immunize the population against the new coronavirus.

The situation has led the regime and representatives of the opposition led by Juan Guaidó to sit down to negotiate to agree on the purchase of vaccines and access the Covax mechanism, a global collaboration initiative that seeks to accelerate the development of treatments, tests and methods of prevention of COVID-19.

Guaidó assured that he is willing to seek the resources so that his country can enter the program, but that its implementation depends on the Maduro regime accepting the scheme of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which coordinates this mechanism in the region. Maduro indicated on Wednesday that the negotiation “is in full swing” and that he hoped it would culminate in a favorable and successful manner.

“We gave everything we have to give and we are only waiting for them to release the 300 million dollars from the Bank of England to buy the vaccines,” he said."
Philly Plans Possible ‘City-Wide’ Hard Lockdown. No Recounts Possible,599,"The city of Philadelphia is planning a city-wide, month long lockdown as cases of coronavirus rise. City health officials said they are discussing the possibility of a full lockdown. If this occurs, a recount of ballots and a look into alleged voter fraud would be impossible to conduct. “Everything is on the table, right down to a complete lockdown to very targeted restrictions,” Farley said. “We had several days where we had more than 600 cases per day. Just a few weeks ago we were about 70 cases a day, so this is a very rapid rise,” Health commissioner Tom Farley said in a Tuesday briefing."
Trump Is Stacking White House With Loyalists This Week As Media Gets Nervous He’ll Keep Office,2794,"To the media, President Trump has lost. They gleefully report on the new “president-elect” Joe Biden. sample headlines have read “Biden will lower taxes, increase healthcare, and reduce student debt” or “Biden is good news for high speed rails” or “scientists relieved that Biden has won.” The arrogance of the media and big tech that has gone for 4 years is now starting to crack though. Because as they report on this new Biden presidency, they nervously eye for President Trump to acknowledge defeat and begin turning the administration over to Biden’s transition team. But the President is not doing that. Instead, the GSA (General Services Administration) has refused to return the Biden team’s phone calls. They won’t even acknowledge that Biden has won. Today, President Trump fired the Secretary Of Defense, and is replacing him with a more loyal Trump supporter with no connections to the deep state. The action has the media questioning if Trump has some kind of military moves planned over the next few weeks. On top of this, it’s been reported by the media that Trump administration officials are telling staff that if they start looking for other jobs, they’ll be fired immediately, and to treat President Trump as a 2nd term president. The media meanwhile is ignoring this and pretending that all is well with the new president Joe. To make the matters more tense, Attorney Generals from over a dozen states have filed a lawsuit in court to challenge Pennsylvania’s last minute policy that allowed ballots to be counted up to 3 days after election day, even if they had no evidence of being mailed before the polls closed. This is being seen as a huge potential for voter fraud, as many ballots were received after election day and it is not known if they were mailed before the polls closed or not. There have also been widespread reports of ballots being backdated, ballots being signed or cleaned up by the counters, GOP ballot counters being denied entry to oversee the counts, and ballots by unregistered voters being counted anyway. In Democrat strongholds of both Detroit and Philadelphia, Republicans were barred completely from even being able to watch the count. The media and social media tech giants meanwhile have both completely ignored these allegation, or outright censored the mere discussion of them. The Trump administration and his supporters are gearing up to hold onto the White House. What’s more, there isn’t really much Biden could actually do if President Trump did keep office. The military supports him almost unanimously, and the gun owners of America are overwhelmingly pro President Trump. For now though, the media is still in their honeymoon phase with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They are posting every sort of fluffy article on him as possible."
"Media Claims Trump Rallies Spread Covid, BLM Riots Stop It",922,"The liberal media has been caught contradicting itself when two leftwing news outlets both reported opposite effects of group activities conducted this year by Democrats and Republicans. The media has long bashed President Trump for hosting rallies during the covid outbreak. He’s been attacked for allegedly causing mass spreading of the virus. But then at the same time, the media has also now been caught claiming that studies said that the BLM riots of the year actually helped stop the spread of coronavirus. As if it isn’t confusing enough, actual elected democratic government health officials have gone on twitter to say that any spreading of the virus done by protesting had racism to blame. in spite of all of this contradictory behavior on the part of the media, there is no difference in the long run for case numbers between places that locked down, didn’t lock down, required masks, and didn’t require masks."
"When Covid Hit, Nurses Needed Masks. So Big Tech Banned Their Sale And Made It Worse",1798,"What happened in 2020 when COVID hit will probably go down as of the greatest examples in US history of market regulation failure. When Covid-19 first struck the US and the country began going into shutdown, Companies, importers, businesses, and manufacturers were making and bringing in masks by the millions. And millions of frontline workers and healthcare professionals were badly in need of them. But there was one problem: every online business in America banned their sale. Amazon, Ebay, Mercari, Offerup and Facebook marketplace all prohibited attempts at selling them. Sellers by the thousands tried constantly to sell the much needed PPE gear online. Buyers working in hospitals and wearing stockings or homemade masks made from clothing articles would attempt to buy them. And then tech giants would ban hammer the listings before anything could be purchased. The problem was exasperated by government municipalities passing laws banning “price gouging.” And so while international prices of raw material to make mask and PPE soared, importers were afraid of even bringing any into the country. If a mask cost $0.02 to the importer before the pandemic and was sold at $0.10, now the mask could cost as much as $0.70 a piece to the importer. Any price the companies could have sold masks for would be considered price gouging, so there was no longer an incentive to. Worse still, there was no market available to sell them on. Today, most of those sites still have policies in place banning PPE. Fortunately the supply has caught up to demand, but there is now still massive backlogs of masks, gloves, and medical supplies that are unable to be effectively put on the market, and keep prices today higher than they should be. The lesson we all learned from covid should be loud and clear."
"Alyssa Milano Wore A Mask All The Time, Tests Positive For Covid-19 Anyway",1169,"Alyssa Milano went on twitter and called people stupid for not wearing a mask. She wore a crocheted mask and bragged about how enlightened she was for it. She wrote months ago to all her followers: “Show me your masks! Masks keep people safe and healthy. Show me yours! Ready? Go! #WearAMask.” New York City Republican councilman Joe Borelli tweeted in response, “Her mask is knitted from yarn, with large holes by her nose. You can see there is nothing under it.” Raheem Kassam, editor of The National Pulse tweeted, “Uhhhh… @Alyssa_Milano’s mask is knitted. Not a real mask in any way. This stops NO germs in OR out. If anything she’s increasing her likelihood of catching something as it will just live on her face. Unreal.” To come back at them, she lashed out, saying that her knitted mask did indeed have a filter. 1 day ago though she posted this photo: “I had COVID-19. I just want you to be aware that our testing system is flawed and we don’t know the real numbers. I also want you to know, this illness is not a hoax. I thought I was dying. It felt like I was dying,” Milano said. Apparently her filtered knitted mask did absolutely nothing at all. SEE ALSO:"
Blacks Were Told By Democrats To Protest. Now They’re Seeing A Covid-19 Surge,1237,"After months of being told to stay indoors at home under lockdown, black Americans were told by Democrats to go out and protest in anger over the death of George Floyd. The results have been disastrous. Blacks are now more likely to die from covid than whites, and cases among black Americans has surged in recent weeks. In majority black counties, the death rate has soared 3.5 times higher than in a non black county. In places where blacks exceed 13% of the population, the proportion they make up of the United States, they are twice as likely to die of coronavirus. This is after weeks of violent protests and riots by Black Lives Matter communities. And instead of warning about social distancing and staying home, Democrats actually encouraged them to go out, and some even said that racism would be to blame for any uptick in covid deaths, not the protesting. Some of these Democrats, like Mark Levine of New York who is on the New York City Council Health Committee, had also encouraged people to go out into crowds as early as February to defy the coronavirus. This continued pattern of patronizing behavior on the part of Democrats towards minorities, as opposed to common sense, is now bearing consequences for black America."
WHO Director Calls For Americas To Go Back Into Hard Lockdown,422,"Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies director, has called for the Americas to go back into a hard lockdown. He said that the Americas, from United States to Brazil, must return to a hard lockdown and that opening up had let to “intense transmission.” He went on to say that “we need to learn to live with this virus,” and that to believe the virus would be gone within a few months was “unrealistic.”"

CHAZ Undercover,3716,"One of the leaders in charge of the July 4th event to retake CHAZ has spent the last few days scouting out the area. His observations were posted in the facebook group below: https://www.facebook.com/events/740456910096468/permalink/748716452603847/# “I’ve spent a few days undercover in CHAZ this week. Here are my thoughts I’d like to share with patriots. First off, this is a real event. Dont let Conservative and liberal haters or fake media diminish our turnout numbers. Now on to CHAZ. I’ve been to war zones, including Lebanon and Iraq. While inside the CHAZ it reminds me of my time in Beirut, which is effectively controlled by the terrorist group Hezbollah.
The govt has ceded control entirely of this area. Bizarre is the only word I can use. The residents are beyond tired of the protesters. I saw 2 separate incidents of residents yelling at protesters in the street in arguments during my first hour here.
There’s a lot of heavy drugs people are on. Perhaps bath salts. At night you see a lot of people violently convulsing while screaming in the streets. On my first night I saw at least 12 people screaming and cursing while having spasms as they walk, definitely on heavy drugs. Its only a matter of time before more innocents are hurt from this.
There are no police at all. You see none. The local businesses have private security contractors who look like police, and they seem to keep protesters at bay with their ARs.
The protesters themselves are a mix of homeless, druggies, spectators, activists, people just here for the party, militants and gang bangers. The armed militant core seems to be split between leftist rednecks calking themselves the Redneck rebellion and inner city gang bangers. It’s a strange combination. Between the rednecks, gang bangers, and pyro loving “activists” you have the organization now that is Antifa.
Everyone looks unhealthy and scrawny. Malnourished. The gang bangers nor rednecks seem to have any military experience. They’re kids with guns.
Theres also cars that come in and out of the CHAZ, including SUVs with tinted windows, very nice cars, which the militants will get supplies out of or put supplies into. There’s a lot of money behind the scenes on this. Whether it’s trust fund kids or something else darker I couldn’t say. But there’s big money in the background funding this.
Since these people stay up and party all night every night, it’s actually very peaceful in the morning when they’re all passed out in their tents. Successfully coming into the zone won’t be a problem since we will do it in the day.
Also, there’s ample space within the zone to setup a Patriot Zone in multiple places so after we leave we can leave a peacekeeping presence. We could even maybe make it a sone against govt overreach and violations of the constitution.
94% of the people here are just angry like us patriots, they’ve just been corrupted into thinking disastrous political ideologies are the answer. They think the solution to bad govt is more govt. I think we all can agree the govt can overstep its authority using the law. Look at our brothers at bundy ranch. But they see the police as an enemy when they should really see the govt making the laws the enemy. Its a misguided anger due to manipulation.
The local communist Councilwoman Sawant seems largely to blame for that. She seems to be the primary sower of chaos here. She encourages them to riot, and seems to be the main leader ironically, which is a disgrace for a sitting councilwoman of an American city. This is her Frankenstein.
Hope this information is helpful and thank you for sticking by this event in spite of all the vicious attacks we all endured (including myself) to make it happen.”

Antifa Members with Active Covid plot to Infiltrate Tulsa Trump Rally,2148,"Tulsa, Oklahoma – For the first time since March, Donald Trump had a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Between the pandemic and recent riots, tensions ran high in the state that recently changed their state slogan to Imagine That! Though ANTIFA has shown that they will go to any length to promote their “anti fascist” agenda, no one could have imagined this.
Social media is buzzing with claims that members of ANTIFA have been encouraging members actively infected with Covid-19 to infiltrate the Trump rally in Tulsa. Though some have speculated that these claims were made by those against ANTIFA in order to further tarnish the organizations already bad reputation, further evidence has emerged, and the evidence is damning.
In a tweet shown below from an account that has since been removed, an active ANTIFA member shows a photograph of his temperature, reading in at 103 degrees.
“Headed to the Tulsa Trump Rally.” A user known as fredcauseee wrote. “Heard boomers don’t have good immune systems.” The ominous tweet was followed by hashtags about Covid19, ANTIFA, and offensive displays of distaste for our President.
 


Though the tweet and corresponding account have since been deactivated, the user had been tweeting about being ill with Covid-19 over the last few days.
Other members of ANTIFA have shown their support for the menacing plan of action by making similar posts on social media nationwide. 
The World Health Organization has stated that the high fevers associated with Covid-19 can be easily masked by taking a simple NSAID, such as Ibuprofen. Even with “fever screenings” at events being held around the country, the screenings are not fool-proof due to readily available fever reducing over the counter medications. With a sea of unmasked faces behind our commander in chief at the Tulsa rally today, the potential devastating consequences of ANTIFA’s inhumane actions are nightmarish.
“Even if someone couldn’t get inside the rally, there were crowds outside. It only takes one person to make everyone else sick.” said a Trump supporter in response to ANTIFA’s horrifying plan.

Seattle Occupiers Change Name To Branch Covidians,461,"(Satire) The occupiers of Seattle changed their name to Branch Covidians today, to celebrate the festering hot zone of covid-19 they created in CHAZ. Occupants, who bath about once a month and have not heard of deodorant, share everything, both to live in communal style, and to spread the virus. Fortunately, CHAZ has no hospital or healthcare system because they have no money (They keep asking for donations), so they are happy to report 0 cases of Covid-19."
The Lockdown Made Absolutely No Sense,3040,"We have now sputtered out of a 3 month nationwide lockdown (almost, but we’ll get to that in a bit) and we left stumbling out onto the streets. For every day of the last 3 months, we debated amongst eachother the merits of the lockdown. Pro lockdown advocates argued that we cannot allow barbershops or restaurants to be open for people to come inside to. Takeout was ok. Dine in was somehow not. But not much of this made sense. There were some states that never shutdown. They saw no difference in case count or hospitalizations. Countries like Taiwan or Japan, with densely populated metropolises, never closed down barbershops, gyms or dine in restaurants. And they are both next to China, the origin country of the virus. They never saw any spikes in covid-19 hospitalizations. But when we brought this up to pro lockdown people, they sneered and fought back. Suicide rates skyrocketed from the lockdown, and yet we stayed closed. All the while, places that never locked down were fine. People went on with freedom to engage in commerce or travel. They were not restricted of their liberties. When Japan was questioned why they didn’t do a forced lockdown, they said they constitution forbids it. What the heck? Is Japan now more American than the USA? Then after 3 months of madness, the most bizarre protest movement broke out. A displaced man from Dallas was arrested while on drugs in Minneapolis trying to possibly pass a counterfeit bill (he very well likely didn’t know it was counterfeit, but if he did then that will come out). He was held on the ground with a knee on his neck for 9 minutes and passed out. He died. The city was outraged by it, and the officers were supended pending investigation. then sudeenly across the country within less than a week of the incident, almost every city and country on earth with a lockdown broke out in protests and riots. A lot of it made no sense. Stores were looted. People became criminals. Hundreds were arrested across the country. Lawyers and homeless alike were caught throwing homemade explosives at police. Police were shot. Store owners murdered. Police cars burned. It was absolute madness. And the same politicians who had fought to keep us inside so long, suddenly encouraged the protests. People were rushed onto the streets after months of being cooped up. And even though there didn’t seem to be a debate over whether the police officer used excessive force, protesters turned into a mob and used it as justification to cause havoc. The health commissioner for New York even said if people get sick, racism is to blame and not the protests. he encouraged people to go out in mobs of protests. Every month is another fake outrage. Another scandal perpetrated by the media and political leaders. None of it made the least bit of sense. And still doesn’t. There is no consistency among our leaders. It is a roller coaster of emotional policies egged on the media, and carried on by the political deep state. And we the average working American suffer in the longrun for it."
"Democrats Ban Social gatherings Of over 12 people, unless its protesters",860,"a California county has come out saying they were banning Social gatherings of 12 or more people, unless its for protesting. According to a statement from the county of Contra Costa reported on the local news channel: “Alameda County announced new health guidelines Friday, including allowing “social bubbles,” and child care and extracurricular activities for children, and the reopening of other businesses like pet grooming. A “social bubble” is defined as a group of up to 12 people from different households. A person should be in just one social bubble at a time, according to the guidelines.” the restrictions were initially void of mentioning religious gatherings, but after criticism from the White House, the county clarified that they were including outdoor religious gatherings of up to 100 people as well. Other events can be up to 12 people only."
Vegas Father Murder-Suicides Family As Lockdown Begins To Take Toll,863,"45 year old Alejandro Figueroa shot and killed his two teenage sons in a drunken, depressed stupor Friday night in Las Vegas. A female caller to police, later identified as his daughter, called to say that Figueroa was drunk and shooting. By the time police arrived, his 2 sons were killed and he had already turned the gun on himself, taking his life. Las Vegas is in the midst of a total shutdown in an effort to “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus. The Governor has ordered all non essential businesses to shut down for a period of 30 days or more. The move has caused economic catastrophe for the citizens; Nevada saw its highest rate of people filing for unemployment in the State’s history. It’s not clear if Figueroa was directly effected by the shutdown, but many posts online brought up the toll on mental health that the shutdown is taking on people."
Dr. Ron Paul: Don’t buy the coronavirus hype,3624,"Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.  By Ron Paul Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security. It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans. Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state. State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state. The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis. On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days. Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this? If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper. The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies? People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic. That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back."

Flashback: Obama waited 6 months to call Swine Flu an emergency after thousands died,694,"The corrupt and dishonest liberal media is slamming Trump for not doing “anything” over the overblown Coronavirus, but Obama did far less, and the media gave him a pass, over the dreaded swine flu in 2009. h1n1 was a big deal, but Obama didn’t know what the hell he was doing In April of 2009, the H1N1 became a pandemic. But it wasn’t until six months later, October, that then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S. CNN reported at the time: Furthermore, the CDC’s Frieden fretted at the time that efforts to create a vaccine had stumbled:"

Like the first person, this patient has not been overseas, and has not been in contact with any known infected or people who’d been overseas. This is leading health officials to believe that the Coronavirus is already in the community being spread by a carrier who is not showing signs of the virus."

"As Coronavirus rages, Bernie wants to open the border",7372,"
 Bernie Sanders and the other presidential candidates want fully open borders, even as the Coronavirus wrecks havoc on the outside world. Bernie said on stage that he wants to allow all who come into the United States, and that there should be no border security. He said he would abolish ICE if elected. This is as the Coronavirus wrecks havoc elsewhere and infected continue to flee into other states. The Coronavirus is barely penetrating the United States, thanks largely in part to President Trump’s strong stance on border security. The virus has been unable to cause an endemic in the United States, even as it spreads elsewhere through the world. The us has seen all known cases to have so far lead to full recovery. Others meanwhile remain in stable condition from the virus. A left wing Harvard professor was charged this month with spying for the Chinese Government. Charles Lieber taught at Harvard University in Boston. he was arrested and after being arraigned in Boston federal court, released on $1 million bail. His arrest is a result of his dealings with the Chinese government. He has not explicitly been charged with espionage yet. But he has been charged with lying to federal department of defense investigators on his dealings with the Chinese Government. lieber was the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department, so his arrest has sent shockwaves through the academic community. Lieber received secret payments of $50,000 a month, plus bonuses, to help China setup a chemical research lab in Wuhan, China. Wuhan is where the new coronavirus plague began. The Harvard-WUT Nano Key Lab was established by Lieber in Wuhan. In April, 2018 he was approached by FBI investigators who asked him about the Wuhan research lab. He said he was unfamiliar with it, and had never been asked for anything by the Chinese government. This was a lie though, and he now faces federal charges. Wuhan is ironically where the coronvirus broke out at. It’s now infected over 75,000 people worldwide. Israeli intelligence officials came out publicly to accuse China of biologically creating the virus. Virus outbreak grows The Coronavirus continues to spread, and it seems now that containing it is not an option. There’s a number of reasons for this. The virus has a long incubation period. It’s being found out now that many people can go infected without even realizing it for a number of days or weeks. The virus also seems to stay with people or come back even after someone has been infected. Because of this, people an walk around infecting others without even realizing it for weeks. The other problem is that it is apparently highly contagious. It doesn’t take much contact to get someone infected. People are becoming sick in places where they don’t even have a record of coming in contact with an infected. It’s been speculated that the Coronavirus was created at a lab in Wuhan. Ironically, China’s only biological research lab for handling weaponized viruses is in Wuhan, China. Recently a professor from the United States who specializes is viral research was charged by the federal government with lying about his work at the laboratory. All signs point to a fact that says the virus was man made. It’s also been exposed in media that the lab there in Wuhan has gotten in trouble before for selling animals that had been experimented on to local markets. An illegal way to make extra cash. Regardless if this is the cause of the outbreak or not, this shows the security lapses at the facility. The virus will not cause mass death. But it will cause mass economic hardship. Putting large numbers of people out of work will have crippling effects on the economy. And this may have been the intended effect all along. Bernie wants to remove the healthcare system defeating Coronavirus America is in the middle of an important election this year. And the stakes have turned deadly. We’re faced with a possible pandemic, not see on earth in over a century. And we need strong leadership to face it. Bernie is looking to be the nominee for the Democrats. Him being President would be disastrous. Senator Sanders spent a good portion of his life as what some may call a loser. Could not keep a job, could never pay rent, always had his utilities turned off. And this was during the 60s and 70s when things were much more affordable. In fact, he lived his life as a revolutionary drifter up until 39. Then he found a way to get paid for being lazy. It was as Mayor of Burlington. Since then, Bernie has been both a Burlington mayor and a vermont Senator. He hasn’t done anything but vocally voice support for communist dictators in the 80s and 90s..he also visited the Soviet Union where he was recorded singing communist songs naked and drunk.

Meanwhile in the United States, the mortality rate is 0%. Every person in the US sick with Coronavirus has made a full recovery. So why would Bernie want to take this healthcare away? Sanders was never taken serious until the past two or three weeks. Now he’s being seen as the front runner for the Democrats and potential nominee. Time will tell if he’ll actually be it. But if he is, then America will have to decide if it wants to take such a deadly risk in electing him. liberal media contributes to panic Across the globe, the media spreads panic about the Coronavirus. But it’s fatality rate is small. If you are already healthy, your chances of dying are slim to none. And for the United States, we’re leading the globe in recovery. While other countries struggle to contain the virus and treat infected, the US already has a whopping 100% recovery rate. Meanwhile, countries with socialist healthcare systems are facing brutal fatality rates, like those in Iran and Italy. And for treatment, while the rest of the world panics and prepares for quarantine, in the United States there’s already been multiple vaccines developed.

Liberal Professor Charged With Lying About involvement In Wuhan Bioweapons Lab,6588,"
 A left wing Harvard professor was charged this month with spying for the Chinese Government. Charles Lieber taught at Harvard University in Boston. he was arrested and after being arraigned in Boston federal court, released on $1 million bail. His arrest is a result of his dealings with the Chinese government. He has not explicitly been charged with espionage yet. But he has been charged with lying to federal department of defense investigators on his dealings with the Chinese Government. lieber was the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department, so his arrest has sent shockwaves through the academic community. Lieber received secret payments of $50,000 a month, plus bonuses, to help China setup a chemical research lab in Wuhan, China. Wuhan is where the new coronavirus plague began. The Harvard-WUT Nano Key Lab was established by Lieber in Wuhan. In April, 2018 he was approached by FBI investigators who asked him about the Wuhan research lab. He said he was unfamiliar with it, and had never been asked for anything by the Chinese government. This was a lie though, and he now faces federal charges. Wuhan is ironically where the coronvirus broke out at. It’s now infected over 75,000 people worldwide. Israeli intelligence officials came out publicly to accuse China of biologically creating the virus. Virus outbreak grows The Coronavirus continues to spread, and it seems now that containing it is not an option. There’s a number of reasons for this. The virus has a long incubation period. It’s being found out now that many people can go infected without even realizing it for a number of days or weeks. The virus also seems to stay with people or come back even after someone has been infected. Because of this, people an walk around infecting others without even realizing it for weeks. The other problem is that it is apparently highly contagious. It doesn’t take much contact to get someone infected. People are becoming sick in places where they don’t even have a record of coming in contact with an infected. It’s been speculated that the Coronavirus was created at a lab in Wuhan. Ironically, China’s only biological research lab for handling weaponized viruses is in Wuhan, China. Recently a professor from the United States who specializes is viral research was charged by the federal government with lying about his work at the laboratory. All signs point to a fact that says the virus was man made. It’s also been exposed in media that the lab there in Wuhan has gotten in trouble before for selling animals that had been experimented on to local markets. An illegal way to make extra cash. Regardless if this is the cause of the outbreak or not, this shows the security lapses at the facility. The virus will not cause mass death. But it will cause mass economic hardship. Putting large numbers of people out of work will have crippling effects on the economy. And this may have been the intended effect all along.

Here’s how you should prepare for a Coronavirus pandemic,1624,"Stop smoking. This is probably the single most important factor that will determine if you are going to die or not. If you smoke, stop. Then, if you are already engaged in a healthy lifestyle, here’s some more steps you should be taking. Stock up on non perishable foods in the event of a food shortage at the grocery store. With everyone sick during a pandemic, food cannot be produced or distributed to meet demand, and grocery stores will go empty. Make sure you have lots of canned and boxed good to last at least 2 or 3 months. Eat and drink healthy. Avoid foods with trans fat, fried foods, or food or drinks with high fructose corn syrup. A healthy body means a healthy immune system. This is another important factor on whether you will survive or not. Prepare medicine at home in the event of hospital overcrowding. Go out and get the steroid symbicort or anti asthma medicine abuderol. Should you get sick and find yourself unable to breath, both medicines will force your lungs open and keep you alive. fever reducing medicine. Make sure to have fever reducing medicine in your house as well. What might be a waste of time: masks. The virus is appearing to be very contagious, and it’s impossible to tell when someone is sick. Getting it could be impossible to avoid. You will in all likelyhood at some point touch something contaminated with the virus, and get it. There still also seems to be an uncertainty as to how exactly it spreads. Lysol or disinfectant. If the virus can survive on unknown infected for weeks, then again, getting it is inevitable. you will likely come into contact with it at some point."

Venezuela Confused Why They’re Worse Than Ever After Electing Socialists,1770,"Venezuela is trying to figure out what went wrong after it elected a Democratic Socialist. The socialist, Hugo Chavez, ran for election and won on a platform of creating income equality, redistributing wealth, and providing free healthcare, education, housing and food. The country elected Hugo Chavez, who confiscated oil refineries and fields from private corporations as promised. He then put them in government control, which is a great idea if you want your oil refineries run like the DMV. Just in 2012, privileged American socialist Mark Weisbrot sat from his perch in the safe comforts of his Chicago home and wrote that ” Millions have access to healthcare for the first time, and college enrolment has doubled, with free tuition for many students. Inequality has also been considerably reduced.” For some reason though, the government began running out of money even though it controlled the oil fields. So after oil companies, it moved on to confiscate farms, factories, and even small businesses. Eventually, anyone with any kind of money had their wealth redistributed. Now Venezuelans no longer have private hospitals, nor can someone legally start one. Only the government provides the healthcare, which is completely free. Same goes for farming. You can’t just farm because you want to. You might get greedy and make too much money. So the government has to do the farming for you. And even though the government gives free food rations, there’s not any options to choose from in the stores anymore. Fortunately the government pays for college so that citizens can achieve whatever degree they wish, free of charge. But sadly, there’s no jobs to actually apply for once they obtain the degree. Oh well. Maybe Socialism will work the next time it’s tried."
People Are Fleeing The States That Taxed The Rich By The Millions,1953,"For some reason, states that try taxing the rich, or following any socialist policies for that matter, see the greatest losses of wealth and people, and economists can’t figure out why. Take California for example. California is run fully by democratic socialists and progressive Democrats now. The weather is the nicest in the country. it’s always sunny. And they have among the top 3 most socialist policies of any state in America. Yet people are still fleeing by the millions. California enjoys free state healthcare to those who need it, very generous taxes to fund public schools, regulation and government oversight of all industries to ensure no industry is allowed to be free market capitalist and exploit consumers, and heavy taxes on the rich and wealthy, generating billions of dollars a year for the state. But oddly, the more progressive the state becomes, the worse the homeless rate and poverty gets, and the more people move out of the state. Illinois is in the same boat, and people there are perplexed. Illinois has followed a very progressive Democratic tax policy. It taxes any and all wealth generated both in the form of high property taxes, on income, and on corporations. For some reason, jobs are continue to leave the state and poverty and homelessness increase. The state is thinking of new and more creative ways to generate revenue, because even though they follow a very progressive model of government, they still have no money. Then there’s New York. Good ol New York. New York was once the Empire State for a reason. It was the economic powerhouse of the world. Sharing the wealth started in New York, and they’ve implemented so much government schooling and wealth taxes since then. But it just keeps getting harder and harder to make a living there now.

Vox: https://www.vox.com/2020/2/11/21133470/voters-believe-trump-reelection The so-called misery index, devised a half-century ago by economist Arthur Okun, is a basic gauge of how the average person feels about the health of the U.S. economy. The indicator, the sum of the unemployment rate and inflation, has recently been hanging around its lowest point in the past four years. A decline over a four-year stretch in the index has tended, with just a few exceptions, to assure that an incumbent president wins re-election, according to an analysis by Bloomberg."
Bloomberg Could Ban Smoking Inside Nationwide,1442,"

 Mayor Mike Bloomberg was infamous for his soda ban in the early 2000s. It was seen as nanny state out of control when it happened. While also banning indoor smoking during his mayoral reign, he’s most known for the soda ban. He banned any sodas larger in size than 16 ounces. It was met with shock by America. But since running for President, it’s come out how he hasn’t shied away from it. He’s double downed on it. In response to his soda ban, he said that sometimes the government does know best, and that there’s times when Americans should just cede their rights. additionally, he went on to say that the government can infringe on whatever freedoms it wants. “I do think there are certain times we should infringe on your freedom,” he said on Meet The Press. This includes prohibiting unhealthy habits indoors, like smoking cigarettes or tobacco, even if it’s in your own home. As he feels that government an make infringements for the good of your health, it would fall within his criteria for a government ban. Bloomberg has scrubbed the internet of the infamous video, but he’s commentary from 2013 when he made the statement. It can also be found in articles from 2013 on NBC News and Washington Examiner. Bloomberg also said recently (within the last 2 years) that poor people need to be taxed to keep them from having money to spend on things he deemed “bad for them.” That video has not been scrubbed and can be seen below.

The Democrats’ Ideas Are Scaring The Sh*t Out Of Mainstream USA,8348,"The Democrats are already off to a horrible start. They are fractured, weak, fanatical, and far too left for middle America. They are scaring the country to death outside of California and New York. All in all, it has the recipe for a bloodbath in November. “I’m not a Republican. I voted for a Democrat before and I voted for a Republican before — and they both lied to me. All a bunch of liars,” Marcomb County, Michigan resident Edward Leonard said in an interview with National Post recently. “This is the first time I really feel a candidate is telling me the truth. Trump always seemed to tell the truth, to tell it like it is. He’s not a politician.” He’s not alone. All across middle America, the sentiment is the same. The major Democrats primarying for the nomination have now come out for: Letting all inmates in prison, including murderers, terrorists, illegals and drug traffickers, vote. Banning cash bail nationwide, which has been disasterous for New York. Doubling the already massive federal budget by 3 to 4 trillion dollars to pay for universal basic income. Such a plan would probably throw the country into economic chaos seen in Venezuela now or Zimbabwe in the past. Letting illegals vote nationwide. Doing away with borders. Leaving the final decision on top department secretary positions to groups of transgender school children. banning guns and nationwide gun confiscation. Passing a healthcare system that would cost trillions of dollars, and making that system accessible to illegals crossing the border. Doing away with people’s private health coverage. Apologizing for the killing of terrorists overseas. But then going to war with North Korea and Turkey. The Democrats have gone so far off the wall, it has made middle America terrified to avoid voting this November and keeping such ideas from getting into the White House. It’s even caused former democratic strongholds across the country to flip red, like counties in Minnesota and Virginia, as well as New Jersey. Only time will tell if the Democrats wise up or not. It’s pushing even lifelong Democrats away Bernie Sanders’ plan to let felons and illegals vote would allow hardcore terrorists, including the mastermind behind 9/11, vote from prison. It’s scared a large number of people, both Democrat and Republican. but the person to really mention the fallacy of Bernie’s plan might surprise you. The point that terrorists would vote under Bernie’s plan was brought up by none other than ragin cajun James Carville on NBC. Carville said that the Democratic Party was losing it’s mind when it came to it’s candidates. He also hit Bernie Sanders for his plan to let people in prison, including terrorists, vote in elections. Carville said that the party choices for president made him “Scared to death” of the November 2020 election. Carville told viewers this week while on MSNBC first that the Democrats need to shape up. He then was interviewed by VOX where he doubled down on the warning. And the more Carville talked, the more he sounds like he is considering Donald Trump. “Eighteen percent of the population controls 52 Senate seats,” Carville said. “We’ve got to be a majoritarian party. The urban core is not gonna get it done. What we need is power! Do you understand? That’s what this is about.” “Look, the turnout in the Iowa caucus was below what we expected, what we wanted. Trump’s approval rating is probably as high as it’s been. This is very bad. And now it appears the party can’t even count votes. What the hell am I supposed to think?” He told VOX. Sean ling with VOX asked him what went wrong. He responded, “I don’t know. We just had an election in 2018. We did great. We talked about everything we needed to talk about and we won. And now it’s like we’re losing our damn minds. Someone’s got to step their game up here.” When asked to give some examples of bad things that Democrats were doing, here’s what he said: “We have candidates on the debate stage talking about open borders and decriminalizing illegal immigration. They’re talking about doing away with nuclear energy and fracking. You’ve got Bernie Sanders talking about letting criminals and terrorists vote from jail cells. It doesn’t matter what you think about any of that, or if there are good arguments — talking about that is not how you win a national election. It’s not how you become a majoritarian party. For fuck’s sake, we’ve got Trump at Davos talking about cutting Medicare and no one in the party has the sense to plaster a picture of him up there sucking up to the global elites, talking about cutting taxes for them while he’s talking about cutting Medicare back home. Jesus, this is so obvious and so easy and I don’t see any of the candidates taking advantage of it. As for Trump’s reelection chances, Carville said if “anyone thinks they can’t win, they’re out of their damn minds.” Many viewers who listened to Carville felt that he was almost trying to convince himself not to join the Republicans. As the Democratic party goes more left, many moderate Democrats have been leaving the party to join the blue collar ranks of the GOP. Senator Bernie Sanders has repeatedly said that he’d give both those who are not citizens, and those who are in prison, the right to vote. That would even include those who were arrested from abroad for terrorism and brought to the US for incarceration. Some notable people who would be allowed to vote from prison: Democrats are jumping ship already to the GOP From Minnesota to new Jersey, Democrats are making the jump and switching to the Republican Party as President Donald J Trump wins over the masses of working class, blue collar Americans. In New Jersey, a congressman by the name of Jeff Van Drew, a Dentist and longtime Democrat, officially switched over to the Republican Party in a massive rally coheld by President Trump. His district has followed suit, with thousands of people attending the event to support the move and embrace the switch from Democratic district to Republican. GOP State Senator Michael Testa of New Jersey called Van Drew a “wonderful addition to the Republican party,” and Trump welcomed him as well with open arms. Van Drew had also voted against articles of impeachment in the House. President Trump is rewarding him by campaigning hard now in New Jersey. And in Minnisota voters were able to take power back into their hands thanks to President Donald Trump signing an executive order allowing communities to ban refugees from being resettled in their jurisdictions. The move went to a vote in the town of Bemidji, Minnesota. The town was considered a stronghold for the Minnesota Democrats, but this January the town was thanking Trump for allowing them to have control of their town again. The Beltami County Board Of Commissioners took it to a vote at a town hall meeting packed wall to wall, and voted 3-2 in favor of the ban. It was the second city in the nation to take advantage of Trump’s order, and the first in Minnesota. “I think we will be making history today,” said Reed Olson who was one of the 2 to vote in favor of keeping refugee resettlement. “President Trump empowered counties to have a voice in the decision-making process for the federal refugee resettlement program,” Republican State Rep. Matt Grossell said to the Duluth News Tribune. “Tonight, Beltrami County exercised that option.” Meanwhile in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Rep Ilhan Omar went on the offensive against the move by the people of Beltrami County. She said that she would never had had the opportunities she had to be elected to Congress had she not been accepted as a refugee by Minnesota, and implored other counties not to follow their lead. What’s even more disturbing for Democrats is that Beltrami County is typically a Democrat County. It has voted Democrat 79% of the time in the past several decades. Minnesota has also been rocked by terrorist activity that the population is not accustomed too. A large percentage of somali refugees have been arrested for either planning terrorist attacks, or attempting to join ISIS. A number of Somalis from Minnesota already have joined ISIS and were killed overseas. The FBI estimates that at least 45 people of Somali backgrounds from Minnesota have joined ISIS successfully, and another dozen arrested for plotting to join ISIS. See also:"

Conservative Firebrand And Romance Guru Deanna Loraine Runs Against Nancy Pelosi,5970,"Watch out Nancy Pelosi. There’s a new congresswoman in town. At least they could be very soon, if Deanna Loraine has her way. The conservative firebrand and romance author is taking on Pelosi. Deanna is running for Congress in California’s 12th district. From her own website she says: “Ms. DeAnna Lorraine is a popular YouTube Host, Conservative Political commentator, Author of ‘Making Love Great Again!’ and Host of her show Winning The Culture War with DeAnna Lorraine – and recent Congressional Candidate running against Nancy Pelosi. As a former Relationship Counselor turned outspoken political & culture warrior, she talks at length about the destructive impacts of Liberalism and how it’s destroying our relationships, the family – and our country on the whole. She’s grown so frustrated with the country and current establishment leaders in fact that she recently decided to run for Congress against none other than Nancy Pelosi of California’s 12th District. She invites everyone to join her in the fight of the millennium to take our country back. DeAnna makes frequent media appearances (CNN, FOX, Newsmax, The Blaze, The Daily Caller, etc), and gave riveting speeches at the Walkaway March, the American Priority Conference, the Eagle’s Council, the #DemandFreeSpeech Rallies, and every other major Conservative event this past year. She believes the pathway to Make America Great Again is by making American culture great again – restoring American values, patriotism, relationships between men and women, and the family.” On her website she talks about restoring god, country, and the family to California’s District 12. Here’s what she also had to say: “I’m DeAnna Lorraine, and I’m running for Congress.  This was never my goal in life to become a “Politician.” But I AM a passionate and concerned American. And I care so damn much about this country that I will not sit idly by and watch my beloved country go down in flames. I believe God is calling myself and all of you to stand up and fight, and I commend you for taking that call in your unique bold way and be a part of His Army. Because we truly are at War, and we are going to need as many of you as possible in this fight.  I’m not going to BS you and act like I’m perfect or I’ve got it all figured out. I’m not a “seasoned politician” who’s been sitting in a gate-guarded mansion the last 30 years out of touch, I have been right here in the trenches with you. We’re going to do this together and build something incredible together. And, we’re going to have fun along the way! This is more than just a campaign, this is a movement. A movement of ordinary Americans doing bold, extraordinary things to save the America we know and love.  But we’re going to have to get past all the “trigger words” and “safe spaces.” My generation doesn’t have time to worry about trigger words, because we have some really important business to do together. And some really important public, honest conversations to have that are going to require us breaking the shackles of political correctness to get to the truth and the bottom of this. Our kids wont even have any safe spaces if we don’t fix these problems now. Our deepest challenges are not left or right, they are not red or blue; they are good versus evil, they are bi-partisan issues that ALL Americans are concerned with and dealing with.  It’s irrelevant what party you affiliate with when you’re homeless on the street, or dying from drug addiction, suffering from a broken family, or snatched into the arms of human traffickers. Abraham Lincoln wisely forewarned in 1838 that if America were to ever collapse, it wouldn’t be from outside forces. We would die by suicide from within. I believe this is what he and our Founding Fathers meant by that. If we keep going on this trajectory with no changes, we are actively enslaving ourselves into a socialist, poverty-stricken, joyless, genderless future. We have been left with a mess, and we have two choices – keep leaving it up to the government to try to fix this, which would of course require greater government power and less personal liberty, or step up to the task, take the power back into our hands and We the People start fixing this. This old, tired government on all sides, from Nancy Pelosi to Mitch McConnell, has proven that they are not doing the job and are failing us. They don’t care about us –  they care about staying comfortable, cozy and wealthy. And soon, they’ll be gone. If Nancy spent half as much time fixing these real problems that all of us Americans are facing as she does focused on identity politics, giving free health care to illegal immigrants, or which gender pronouns we should use, we might actually make real progress. We are capable of preserving this next generation and saving this crumbling empire. The question is, will you be bold and take on this task? Will you join me in this fight? And if you don’t normally vote for someone like me, can you put our differences aside and work together to fix these problems that our predecessors left us with for the greater good of the country so we can leave our next generation, our children and grandchildren with a nation that’s safe, prosperous, and free? It’s time. It’s up to US. This is the battle of our lifetime. And together, we WILL win this fight!“ Her platform according the website follows as such: “ I am committed to restoring the American Family, the Institution of Marriage, and unifying relationships between men and women. I believe strong relationships and strong families create a strong America. Our country is in a crisis of broken families and fatherless homes, and we need to restore these crucial elements to improve our country’s prosperity We need to save the principles and Values that made America so Exceptional if we want to restore California and America You can like her facebook and twitter page, and also donate to her on her website. https://www.deannaforcongress.com/"
Iowa Democrats Say Superbowl Hangovers Reason for Low Voter Turnout,6014,"
 All of the Democrats have now declared victory in Iowa. Joe Biden was the first to make his announcement, posting a public statement just hours after the caucusing ended. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the Democrats jumped on the band wagon and declared that they too, had won the race and would move onward to victory in New Hampshire. Eventually as we know, Buttigieg was announced the winner, though Bernie Sanders is not conceding defeat.   But the real winner was not a Democrat that night. It was a Republican. For an incumbent President to get 30,000 votes in an Iowa Caucus was thought impossible before last night. But that’s exactly what President Trump did. The media has shy’d away from this though for obvious reasons, instead focusing on Democrat Caucus Armageddon. 
 The Democrats are still not totally clear on the winner, whether it be Buttigieg or Sanders, but they know how many people showed up to caucus, and it is not looking good for them. Previously, Democrats predicted a record turnout for the caucus in comparison or beatable to 2008. But this wasn’t the case at all from what we saw last night. What’s ironic is that the Democrats have touted a predicted record turnout as proof of a blue wave for November against Donald Trump. Instead, swing and new voters are apparently not excited by the prospects of a Democrat for President.
And on top of this, only 1/3 of caucus goers were first timers for the Democrats, much less than 2016 when almost half had never caucused with the Dems before. This is further proof that new voters do not want any of the Democratic candidates. Democrats had hoped to break their record turnout ever which was in 2008. Back then, 240,000 people caucused in the Democratic primary in Iowa. Early predictions for this year are at most, 170,000. That is more like 2016, and it may even be less. It spells very very bad news for the DNC. And according to politico, some Democrats are blaming the super bowl for their loss. Politico said this while reporting from caucus ground zero: ” In Iowa, Democrats offered any number of reasons for the ho-hum showing. Caucus night was cold. People were still weary after Super Bowl parties the night before. In one county, a high school basketball game drew potential caucus-goers away.” Going back to the Republican side, President Trump won the Iowa caucus with a whopping 97.1% of the vote, with both a record high win for an incumbent and a record high turnout for an incumbent. President Trump smashed records. In total over 30,000 Republicans caucused just to show their support for the President. This is widely seen as a rubber stamp of approval from conservatives in farm country, who the media has been reporting erroneously on as leaving the President due to his trade war. Obama for example, only received about 8000 votes to win his democratic Iowa caucus while running as an incumbent in 2012. “What we know right now is that around 25% of precincts have reported, and early data indicates turnout is on pace for 2016,” the party’s communications director, Mandy McClure, said in a prepared statement. And for the few Republicans who tried going against the President, it didn’t go well. Joe Walsh got booed out of an Iowa GOP Caucus last night while trying to badmouth President Donald Trump. The incident was captured on video which can be seen below. The reasoning behind the Democrat’s caucus debacle is because of a fancy new app that was supposed to be used to track voting. The app has malfunctioned, much like the Obamacare website, causing the entire system to meltdown and chaos to ensue throughout the state. President Trump made jokes about it on twitter this morning. “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is “Trump.” The President then went on to retweet an image of a burning dumpster that was posted by Dan Scavino. The democratic party has said that they are conducting “quality control,” and that everything is fine. They will not give the press nor the campaigns any answers though as to what the problem is. Rumors are abound that Joe Biden has done horribly tonight and this is the reason for the delay of results being released. It’s quite an embarrassment for a political party that is campaigning on promises to expand government by two or three times the size it is now, along with government spending. While many Americans argue that the government is already way too big, every single Democratic candidate running for President disagrees. This includes having the government take over healthcare. BIDEN CAMP RELEASES STATEMENT 10:50pm, Iowa The Biden campaign has released a pretty cranky letter by the wording of it and basically told the DNC that he’s not going to wait around for them to release the Iowa results. Dana Remus, Biden’s general counsel:  “I write on behalf of the Biden for President Campaign regarding the considerable flaws in tonight’s Iowa Caucus reporting system. The app that was intended to relay Caucus results to the Party failed; the Party’s back-up telephonic reporting system likewise has failed. Now, we understand that Caucus Chairs are attempting to — and, in many cases, failing to — report results telephonically to the Party. These acute failures are occurring statewide. We appreciate that you plan to brief the campaigns momentarily on these issues, and we plan to participate. However, we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released. We look forward to hearing from you promptly. In the meantime, we are on to New Hampshire, on the road to the most important election of our lifetimes.” CLAIM YOUR FREE MAGA HAT AND FLAG AT THE LINK BELOW: https://magacart.com/"

White House to consider petition to arrest Pelosi for shredding State of The Union speech,5818,"Nancy Pelosi ripped up Donald Trump’s State of The Union speech, and now the Democrats are flipping out that their Speaker may head to jail based on a legal provision 37 year old Congressman from Florida and experience Lawyer Rep. Matthew Gaetz has filed an ethics complaint with the House Committee on Ethics against Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her paper rip publicity stunt, saying she broke laws 1 and 22 of House Rule XXIII, which layout under law the House’s official rules of conduct. “Her behaviour does not ‘reflect creditably on the House,’ nor does it follow ‘the spirit and the letter of the Rules of the House.” her “unseemly behaviour certainly warrants censure.”
He then went on to ask that the Committee refer the case to the Department of Justice for prosecution. Rep. Gaetz says that Pelosi violated a provision of the law that makes it illegal to purposely destroy or mutilate official documents filed with the public office\ 

 Thousands upon thousands have signed the petition to remove the disgraceful Nancy Pelosi for her QQstunt performed during the State Of The Union address on Tuesday night. Pelosi shocked the nation when the she ripped up the speech Donald Trump gave during SOTU. Sign the petition in the link below. Trashy Nancy disgusted the nation when she tore up President Trump’s State Of The Union speech on live Television… behind his back! Well now we’re getting a clearer picture as to why she did such a tasteless act. And it is telling of a woman who is obviously becoming unhinged before America’s very eyes. One blunder after another by this mad woman and we are never shocked by the latest outrage. New footage has also emerged showing that Nancy PRE-RIPPED the speech even before Donald Trump snubbed her.  her answer has disgusted Americans who found President Trump’s speech “unifying.” And earlier this year, a photo began circulating online of Speaker Nancy Pelosi on stage at an event in California and appearing to pick her nose.

The speaker has had an array of embarrassing moments over the decade involving incidents where her health was called into question. Losing mental awareness Nancy Pelosi has through out the years gotten worse and worse on the public stage. Just this year during a press conference, she mumbled uncontrollably in front of the cameras and muttered incoherently. People watching could barely make out what she was trying to say. the video’s gone viral of Pelosi trying to talk to reporters about impeachment, but failing to come off coherently. She gave a speech to the press about the articles of impeachment and when asked what shes going to do next, had what some are calling online a very peculiar response.

Universal Basic Income Has Been Tried Before. It Failed Miserably Every Time,2253,"Democrats have found that promising only free college and healthcare isn’t enough to win the vote they need to get elected. So they’ve found a new golden calf to hold onto; universal basic income, or UBI. The concept of UBI has been made popular thanks to Andrew Yang. Other Democrats are now jumping onto the UBI bandwagon like Tulsi Gabbard or Bernie Sanders who wouldn’t outright say he supports giving away free money, but said that “every American deserves a minimum standard of living.” But the problem with all this is that UBI has been tried before. It failed. The more known failure of UBI was in Finland. Finland did find that it made people happier who received a no strings attached basic monthly income. But it also made them lazier. In fact, Finland actually ended the expirement and passed stricter welfare rules because of it. The Finnish government started the pilot program in 2017 with 2000 rando adults between the ages of 25 and 58. It gave them a no strings attached monthly allotment of about $500 a month. It determined that the practice actually makes people less productive, thus becoming permanent leeches on the system. They ended the practice effectively, and instead set up mandatory work requirements to receive welfare. In the United States, it’s also been tried. between 1968 and 1980, the Federal Government tried the experiement in six states with random individuals. The hope was that a universal basic income would provide work. In fact, it did the complete opposite. The expirement found that the UBI reduced “desired hours of work by 9 percent for husbands, by 20 percent for wives, and by 25 percent for single female heads of families.” For single males who were not a household head, UBi reduced hours worked by a whopping 43%. People on UBI also lost their jobs easier, and when unemployed, a husband took on average two years longer to find a new job, and for wives over a year. For single mothers, they did not go back to work. For every $1,000 in additional benefits, there was an average reduction of $660 in earned income, meaning that $3,000 in government benefits were required to increase net income by $1,000. This makes UBI mathematically impossible. For the Democrats though, it makes perfect sense."
Over 540 Americans Are Now quarantined By Military Against Their Will On US Soil,1441,"350 more Americans arrived yesterday from overseas, bringing the total number of quarentined Americans to over 500 now. They are being housed for a minimum of 14 days against their will at military installations across the US. At least 70 Americans are in an air force base at Camp Ashland, Nebraska. The quarantine rooms are used typically for soldiers or military students. They are similar to modest hotel rooms, though the quarantined Americans are not allowed to leave the base. “We’re taking this action to protect the safety of all Americans,” Kasowski said. “This is part of our aggressive response. The goal of our public health response is to quickly stop the spread in the U.S. Our goal today, tomorrow and always is the safety of the American public.” Nebraska Gov.

Sign The Official Petition Demanding Pelosi’s Removal,2429,"Thousands upon thousands have signed the petition to remove the disgraceful Nancy Pelosi for her stunt performed during the State Of The Union address on Tuesday night. Pelosi shocked the nation when the she ripped up the speech Donald Trump gave during SOTU. Sign the petition in the link below. Trashy Nancy disgusted the nation when she tore up President Trump’s State Of The Union speech on live Television… behind his back! Well now we’re getting a clearer picture as to why she did such a tasteless act. And it is telling of a woman who is obviously becoming unhinged before America’s very eyes. One blunder after another by this mad woman and we are never shocked by the latest outrage. New footage has also emerged showing that Nancy PRE-RIPPED the speech even before Donald Trump snubbed her.  her answer has disgusted Americans who found President Trump’s speech “unifying.” And earlier this year, a photo began circulating online of Speaker Nancy Pelosi on stage at an event in California and appearing to pick her nose. The photo was suppressed for over a decade before surfacing online. The photo, taken by a photographer named Chris Roberts, can be found in the link below. The photo was reportedly taken on November 25th, 2008. While it’s not unusual for one to pick their nose, for Nancy to do it on stage in front of cameras has had some raise questions about her mental health. The speaker has had an array of embarrassing moments over the decade involving incidents where her health was called into question. Losing mental awareness Nancy Pelosi has through out the years gotten worse and worse on the public stage. Just this year during a press conference, she mumbled uncontrollably in front of the cameras and muttered incoherently. People watching could barely make out what she was trying to say. the video’s gone viral of Pelosi trying to talk to reporters about impeachment, but failing to come off coherently. She gave a speech to the press about the articles of impeachment and when asked what shes going to do next, had what some are calling online a very peculiar response. And in another video recorded of her speaking with reporters, she once again comes off incoherent and unable to speak clearly. She tells reporters that she has to save the world from peril.

Democrats Give Victory Speeches And Say They All Won Iowa,5732,"All of the Democrats are coming out now to declare victory in Iowa. Joe Biden was the first to make his announcement, posting a public statement just hours after the caucusing ended. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the Democrats jumped on the band wagon and declared 1that they too, had won the race and would move onward to victory in New Hampshire. For an incumbent President to get 30,000 votes in an Iowa Caucus was thought impossible before last night. But that’s exactly what President Trump did. The media has shy’d away from this though for obvious reasons, instead focusing on Democrat Caucus Armageddon. 
 The Democrats may not know who won the primary, but they know how many people showed up to caucus, and it is not looking good for them. Previously, Democrats predicted a record turnout for the caucus in comparison or beatable to 2008. But this wasn’t the case at all from what we saw last night. What’s ironic is that the Democrats have touted a predicted record turnout as proof of a blue wave for November against Donald Trump. Instead, swing and new voters are apparently not excited by the prospects of a Democrat for President.
And on top of this, only 1/3 of caucus goers were first timers for the Democrats, much less than 2016 when almost half had never caucused with the Dems before. This is further proof that new voters do not want any of the Democratic candidates. Democrats had hoped to break their record turnout ever which was in 2008. Back then, 240,000 people caucused in the Democratic primary in Iowa. Early predictions for this year are at most, 170,000. That is more like 2016, and it may even be less. It spells very very bad news for the DNC. Even if someone like Bernie Sanders wins the Iowa Caucuses, it will have been so on lackluster numbers. Bloomberg meanwhile is reported to have gotten 0%. President Trump meanwhile has long touted that he has 95% support among Republicans in the party. But last night in Iowa, Republican caucus goers everywhere proved him wrong. President Trump won the Iowa caucus with a whopping 97.1% of the vote, with both a record high win for an incumbent and a record high turnout for an incumbent. President Trump smashed records. In total over 30,000 Republicans caucused just to show their support for the President. This is widely seen as a rubber stamp of approval from conservatives in farm country, who the media has been reporting erroneously on as leaving the President due to his trade war. Obama for example, only received about 8000 votes to win his democratic Iowa caucus while running as an incumbent in 2012. “What we know right now is that around 25% of precincts have reported, and early data indicates turnout is on pace for 2016,” the party’s communications director, Mandy McClure, said in a prepared statement. And for the few Republicans who tried going against the President, it didn’t go well. Joe Walsh got booed out of an Iowa GOP Caucus last night while trying to badmouth President Donald Trump. The incident was captured on video which can be seen below. Democrats went to sleep last night not knowing who won the Iowa caucus on Monday because of a fancy new app that was supposed to be used to track voting. The app has malfunctioned, much like the Obamacare website, causing the entire system to meltdown and chaos to ensue throughout the state. President Trump made jokes about it on twitter this morning. “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is “Trump.” The President then went on to retweet an image of a burning dumpster that was posted by Dan Scavino. The democratic party has said that they are conducting “quality control,” and that everything is fine. They will not give the press nor the campaigns any answers though as to what the problem is. Rumors are abound that Joe Biden has done horribly tonight and this is the reason for the delay of results being released. It’s quite an embarrassment for a political party that is campaigning on promises to expand government by two or three times the size it is now, along with government spending. While many Americans argue that the government is already way too big, every single Democratic candidate running for President disagrees. This includes having the government take over healthcare. BIDEN CAMP RELEASES STATEMENT 10:50pm, Iowa The Biden campaign has released a pretty cranky letter by the wording of it and basically told the DNC that he’s not going to wait around for them to release the Iowa results. Dana Remus, Biden’s general counsel:  “I write on behalf of the Biden for President Campaign regarding the considerable flaws in tonight’s Iowa Caucus reporting system. The app that was intended to relay Caucus results to the Party failed; the Party’s back-up telephonic reporting system likewise has failed. Now, we understand that Caucus Chairs are attempting to — and, in many cases, failing to — report results telephonically to the Party. These acute failures are occurring statewide. We appreciate that you plan to brief the campaigns momentarily on these issues, and we plan to participate. However, we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released. We look forward to hearing from you promptly.

Only Socialism can make a rainforest run out of water and food.,1473,"After the electrical service in Carabobo was restored after the blackouts that lasted 4 days, water began to arrive in some sectors, however, residents of the San Diego municipality were surprised that it was coming out dirty and with a foul odor. Given these complaints, Hidrocentro communicated the reason why the water is coming out in this way is because it “was vandalized by unscrupulous people, causing sediment filtration” the great majority of the inhabitants know that this is a total lie, in addition to the fact that the lake that supplies water to several states is a gigantic unhealthy sewer, for years there is no proper maintenance of the service, and no adequate treatment of the Water. Where does the entire budget go to improve the quality of water service? Very simple, it is stolen (as usual) by the administration on duty. Only last year dozens of people were hospitalized for peritonitis and parasitic infections caused by poor water quality, but as usual the socialist government does not reveal the exact number of people hospitalized for this cause. Not only in the Carabobo state, but, in neighboring states such as Aragua and Cojedes, there are many homes that are stocked with water by the same unhealthy source. Obviously, the mature dictatorship is not in the least interested in improving the treatment service, nor will they care about the amount of people who can potentially get sick and even die from the consumption of that dirty water."

"Even If Some Families Kiss On Lips, Biden Shouldn’t Do So On Stage With His Granddaughter",5504,"Joe Biden kissed his granddaughter on the lips on live Television in front of an audience of thousands of people yesterday as he did a last minute campaign effort for Iowa. The incident occured during an Iowa rally as Creepy Joe fights for the Democratic nomination. The event was his last rally before Iowa caucusing start. The event was being held at Clarke University in Dubuque, Iowa. Biden is 77. His granddaughter is 19. “I would like to introduce you to my granddaughter Finnegan Biden. The reason I asked Finnegan — grandfathers are always allowed to embarrass their granddaughters — that goes along with the territory,” Biden told the audience while he put his hand over her shoulder. “Her other grandma graduated from Clarke College in the mid-’60s and talks about it all the time.” “But granddaughters not only love their grandpops but they like them. And that’s the great thing. Thank you, baby,” he told her, and then proceeded to plant a kiss on Finnegan’s lips. “No man should EVER kiss his granddaughter like such … This is a weird family. Who’s running this man’s campaign??” said Diante Johnson, the president of America’s Black Conservative Federation organization. Some readers have mentioned that this is not unusual for some families. However, our editorial staff believes that even if this was an acceptable display of affection for the Bidens, Joe Biden should not be doing this with his granddaughter for the cameras, when he is trying to put away an image of him not being creepy. there’s been complaints often that Biden is out of touch with the way times have changed, and that he is not all there mentally. He’s often shown up confused on stage or said comments that did not make sense. Its thought to be a major reason why he’s dropped so much in polls. Earlier in the campaign season when an illegal lover heckled Joe Biden, Biden challenged the man to a pushup competition. And photos have circulated online often of Joe Biden being very close to women, to where it makes them uncomfortable. The incidents over the years have been so common, it’s led him to be called Creepy Joe Biden.

While many Americans argue that the government is already way too big, every single Democratic candidate running for President disagrees. This includes having the government take over healthcare. BIDEN CAMP RELEASES STATEMENT 10:50pm, Iowa The Biden campaign has released a pretty cranky letter by the wording of it and basically told the DNC that he’s not going to wait around for them to release the Iowa results. Dana Remus, Biden’s general counsel:  “I write on behalf of the Biden for President Campaign regarding the considerable flaws in tonight’s Iowa Caucus reporting system. The app that was intended to relay Caucus results to the Party failed; the Party’s back-up telephonic reporting system likewise has failed. Now, we understand that Caucus Chairs are attempting to — and, in many cases, failing to — report results telephonically to the Party. These acute failures are occurring statewide. We appreciate that you plan to brief the campaigns momentarily on these issues, and we plan to participate. However, we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released. We look forward to hearing from you promptly. In the meantime, we are on to New Hampshire, on the road to the most important election of our lifetimes.” 10:30pm Horrible turnout recorded The Democrats are starting to worry as the results come in of voter turnout, and it is not looking good for them. Previously, Democrats predicted a record turnout for the caucus. But this wasn’t the case. What’s ironic is that the Democrats have touted a predicted record turnout as proof of a blue wave for November against Donald Trump. This would appear to not be the case. And on top of this, only 1/3 of caucus goers were first timers for the Democrats, much less than 2016 when almost half had never caucused with the Dems before. Democrats hoped to break their record turnout ever which was in 2008. Back then, 240,000 people caucused in the Democratic primary in Iowa. Early predictions for this year are at most, 170,000."
"With Iowa Democrats, everybody is a winner and have 0 to show for it",3648,"

 

 No wonder the Democrats thought something was fishy with Donald Trumps win in 2016, not only do they need “quality control” to examine their election results, but their turnout has hit a nadir, in spite of the media promoting their caucus and their candidates endlessly, and the media saying President Trump poses an existential crisis to the world. The Democrats all want to run the economy, run our healthcare, and run our military, but can’t even run a caucus using archaic 18th century rules with less than 200,000 people voting. Meanwhile, President Trump’s campaign claimed victory with almost 99% of the vote within an hour of the caucus closing. Maybe the RNC is just better organized.
 

 Democrats will go to sleep not knowing who won the Iowa caucus on Monday night because of a fancy new app that was supposed to be used to track voting. The app has malfunctioned, much like the Obamacare website, causing the entire system to meltdown and chaos to ensue throughout the state. The democratic party has said that they are conducting “quality control,” and that everything is fine. They will not give the press nor the campaigns any answers though as to what the problem is.

Rumors In Las Vegas swirl of Coronavirus hitting the City and infected coming into Emergency Rooms.,1097,"A rumor started on twitter by an account named Las Vegas locally has said that the Coronavirus is in the Naked City. The user said that a chinese national who flu into the city earlier in the month has tested positive for the disease and is in Southern Hills Hospital. They are a local scuttlebutt of information with sources throughout the Las Vegas area. They said a source told them of the infected. The report set off a whirlwind of mini panic throughout the city via social media. State and County health officials denied the report initially, saying that the information was false. The hospital also denied the information, sending an internal email to hospital staff telling them to deny the reports and that there was no coronavirus in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Locally goes on to say that the source believes this to be incorrect. Nonetheless, to remain accurate, Las Vegas Locally deleted their original tweet. Then, this morning, reports came out from the Clark County Health Department that confirmed the initial report. It looks like coronavirus is in the Naked City after all. see also:

"As socialism thrives in Venezuela, breast Cancer patients struggle over medicine shortages",2266,"Venezuelans challenge shortages to survive breast cancer. In 2018 alone, about 4,700 women in Venezuela became ill with breast cancer, according to the Anticancer Society of Venezuela (SAV). However, since 2012 the Ministry of Health does not offer official figures. Grecia Solís is 49 years old, and after being diagnosed with breast cancer she had to raise money between family and friends to undergo the operation in a private clinic. It was his way of circumventing the lack of supplies in the public hospital of Venezuela. “It hurts not to know if you can say‘ I am a cancer survivor, ’” Solís recently told La Voz de América. She had been diagnosed in September 2017. Because of her condition, doctors recommended surgery, and then chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He said that “due to the country situation, the lack of supplies, raw materials and reagents, it was impossible to operate in the hospital. I had to go to the good heart of my family and my friends, in order to raise the money for the operation “. She was finally operated in a private institution in May 2018. The surgery cost $ 500. For his chemotherapy, he had the financial help of his sister in Ecuador and the High Cost Pharmacy, belonging to the Social Security of the country. He completed eight sessions in December 2018. And that was when his ordeal began. Having cancer terrifies any patient suffering from this disease in Venezuela, due in part to the increasing risk of dying without treatment. The shortage of medicines and the limited access to treatments, adds to the weight and pain that patients already carry. In 2018 alone, about 4,700 women in Venezuela became ill with breast cancer, according to the Anticancer Society of Venezuela (SAV). However, since 2012 the Ministry of Health does not offer official figures. In 2018, SAV also registered 2,300 deaths from this type of cancer, this being one of the main causes of cancer death of Venezuelan women. According to the NGO SenosAyuda, in the country between 17 and 19 women are diagnosed with the disease daily. The treatments needed to fight cancer are becoming increasingly inaccessible in the face of the deepening of the humanitarian emergency.

"Venezuela, once almost malaria-free, now has most cases in Latin America.",459,"Fifty years ago, Venezuela was considered one of the main countries of South America in the fight against malaria. Although it was not completely eradicated, the efforts served to drastically reduce the number of cases in the country during the following decades. However, in recent years the epidemic has returned strongly. In fact, in 2019, the country was declared the most affected in Latin America by this disease, with more than 320,000 cases diagnosed."
Over 100 Americans have now been quarantined for Coronavirus symptoms,7234,"

 The Coronavirus has touched down in America. A spattering of cases of begun to pop up across the country now as more than a hundred people infected have been quarantined with 2 tests already confirming the virus. The virus has no vaccines to prevent it from taken control of the body. It infects the subject with high fevers that can result in overheating to death, attacks on the respiratory system that cause difficulty breathing, and horrible coughs and wheezing as the virus takes hold. The virus is believed to have originated in Wuhan city, China. But where exactly it started is subject to debate. The Chinese government says that it started in a seafood market. But evidence suggests this is not the case, and an israeli intelligence official came forward this week to suggest that the virus came from China’s biological warfare lab in Wuhan. Just tonight, 2 more people were quarantined in the US, this time in New Hampshire. New Hampshire state epidemiologist Ben Chan said this about the infected. “The risk to our communities in New Hampshire is low, but we want to identify people who may be infected with this new coronavirus in order to prevent spread,” Chan said. “We have recommended that health care providers conduct travel screenings and implement isolation practices for patients with a fever or respiratory illness who report travel to this affected region of China. This is a rapidly changing situation, and we remain committed to providing timely updates to residents of New Hampshire and our health care providers.” Infected are escaping China A chinese national from the quarantined city of Wuhan went on social to brag about sneaking out of the country via the airport, even though she was showing symptoms of the coronavirus. She managed to successfully suppress her cough and symptoms, fooling befuddled airport security officers. She did such a good job at hiding her symptoms, the thermal detectors were even fooled. She then jettisoned out of the country and to France, where she went on to dine at a Michelin star restaurant. Shortly after her “escape,” the airports were closed down completely. The woman then went on to chronicle her trickery online on social media. She gallivanted across at least France after landing in Paris, because the photos were taken in the french city of Lyon. “Finally I can have a good meal, I feel like I’ve been starving for two days. When you are in a gourmet city of course you have to eat Michelin [food],” she wrote. “Just before I left, I had a low fever and cough. I was scared to death and rushed to eat [fever-reducing] medicine. I kept on checking my temperature. Luckily I managed to get it down and my exit was smooth.” The chinese government, naturally embarrassed, had the embassy track the woman down though, and according to the embassy, her symptoms are under control. Whatever that means. Monday Morning, January 27th, Beijing- China’s death toll for the coronavirus has doubled now, officially rising to 80 confirmed deaths this morning in China. This is while thousands are hospitalized with the virus that seems to have jumped from animals to people. Also today, a nurse and first responder in Wuhan province, China, is coming clean online. She released a video at ground zero of the virus outbreak where she says that the number of people that the Chinese government has said are infected is a lie. 
 “I am in the area where the coronavirus started,” her video starts with. Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak. “I’m here to tell the truth,” says the anonymous nurse, in a video that shows her in the mask and hazmat suits that responders have been seen wearing. “At this moment, Hubei province, including the Wuhan area, even China, 90,000 people have been infected by a coronavirus.” While government reports have put the infected toll at around 3000 now, she says the actual number is over 100,000. If so, it will mean that the virus i far more contagious and dangerous than originally thought.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVHFmVccWns As China battles the Coronavirus, it is taking drastic steps to reduce the spread of the disease. It’s method? The building of mass camps that can hold millions of people. All throughout the country, the regime is setting up “quarentine centers” to hold those anyone thought to be infected with the virus. The virus originated in the domestic economic capital of Wuhan, a city of millions of people. It spread rapidly though and has now killed dozens, and infected thousands across the country. It is also appearing in places outside of China, across the globe. Beijing is using the same strategy it used to combat SARs virus. That virus 17 years ago has taught the Chinese regime much about virus control. China is now taking precautionary measures by establishing quarantines throughout all of China. In Hong Kong for example, a quarantine center being established was firebombed by protesters who have been protesting for the past year. It was not even previously known to the world that China was setting up a quarantine center in Hong Kong, which is hundreds of miles away from where the virus supposedly is. The infected toll has risen in China officially to over 2000 people, but some reports are saying that the true number is far higher, in the tens of thousands. If so, then the virus is far more serious than people originally thought. January 26th update: The official toll of those infected according to official Chinese numbers as risen to almost 3000. This is developing and we will keep readers updated as more information comes out. 
The last pandemic was in 1918. It killed 50 million people Not many people know about the Spanish influenza of 1918. That period was wrought with death on the planet as humanity saw the deadliest war in history at the time. When World War 1 ended, 1% of the world’s population was dead from fighting. But another more serious killer was upon us. It was a virus. Every hundred years or so, a deadly virus sweeps across the globe, taking with it large portions of people. In 1918, it was H1N1. The virus was born not surprisingly in France, at a troop staging area and hospital for men from the front line. Years of brutal trench warfare that left millions dead had ground down civilized conditions in most military camps throughout Europe. Doctors began reporting a particularly violent strain of flu in late 1917, almost simultaneously in US military camps in Kansas and in hospitals for soldiers in France. The exact origin of the virus is unclear, but most experts hypothesize that the virus started in France and was brought back to US military camps by returning soldiers. By 1918, the virus was in full swing. Not much was known about influenza then, or the deadliness of it’s spread. 1 sneeze or cough can send over half a million virus particles flying into the air, and it spread rapidly throughout troop lodgings. It was ironic that just as the virus hit, soldiers from ground zero of the where the disease struck were returning home all over the world to their home countries, bringing the virus with them. All told, 50 to 100 million people are thought to have died. It’s only a matter of time before the next virus strikes. See Also:

POLL: GOP Voter SURGE Has Democrats Panicking. Florida Moves Hard Red.,3562,"

 Good news for Republicans: according to Florida state data on voter registration in the month of December, 29 percent of new voters registered as Democrats, 34 percent registered as Republicans, and 37 percent registered as NPA – for a total of 50,733 total voter registrations in Florida. Total state voter registrations show 37 percent are Democrats, 35 percent are Republicans and 28 percent are NPAs. This is a huge boost for Republicans, and bucks a trend in many other places that have more Democrats registering to vote than Republicans. It also almost ensures that President Trump will maintain his support in the sunshine state. And a poll released this week also backs that up. The poll has him crushing every democrat front runner in a hypothetical election. The poll shows head to head races with each democratic opponent and Donald Trump, with Trump winning in each lineup. The same poll also showed that a large bulk of the sunshine state are completely behind the President in the impeachment trials. Also good news for republicans, Governor Desantis has an incredible 68% approval rating, with only 18% disapproving of him. For impeachment, 52% strongly disapprove of the President being removed from office, and only 43% approve. “Floridians are confident in Governor DeSantis and, while they’re concerned about healthcare costs and workforce quality, support his efforts to help keep Florida moving in the right direction and champion solutions,” said Mark Wilson, President and CEO, Florida Chamber of Commerce. These are all of the results from the Florida poll: Governor DeSantis Approve/Disapprove:
68% approve
18% disapprove
14% unsure
 Florida Right/Wrong Direction:
63% right direction
24% wrong track
13% not sure
 After impeachment, should President Trump be removed from office?
TOTAL VOTERS: 52% disapprove, 43% approve

More People Are Registering Republican Than Democrat In Florida. Liberals Are Worried,3559,"Good news for Republicans: according to Florida state data on voter registration in the month of December, 29 percent of new voters registered as Democrats, 34 percent registered as Republicans, and 37 percent registered as NPA – for a total of 50,733 total voter registrations in Florida. Total state voter registrations show 37 percent are Democrats, 35 percent are Republicans and 28 percent are NPAs. This is a huge boost for Republicans, and bucks a trend in many other places that have more Democrats registering to vote than Republicans. It also almost ensures that President Trump will maintain his support in the sunshine state. And a poll released this week also backs that up. The poll has him crushing every democrat front runner in a hypothetical election. The poll shows head to head races with each democratic opponent and Donald Trump, with Trump winning in each lineup. The same poll also showed that a large bulk of the sunshine state are completely behind the President in the impeachment trials. Also good news for republicans, Governor Desantis has an incredible 68% approval rating, with only 18% disapproving of him. For impeachment, 52% strongly disapprove of the President being removed from office, and only 43% approve. “Floridians are confident in Governor DeSantis and, while they’re concerned about healthcare costs and workforce quality, support his efforts to help keep Florida moving in the right direction and champion solutions,” said Mark Wilson, President and CEO, Florida Chamber of Commerce.

America stopped being Capitalist over 100 years ago. This should change.,3978,"Certain American politics of the right persuasion love to criticize socialism and call for protecting capitalism, and too many left wing politicians are building their careers on critiquing capitalism, but the truth is America has for the past 150 years strayed so far away from the original form of capitalism that the country was founded upon, the godfathers of American capitalism wouldn’t even consider it capitalist at all. American economic might came from it’s rapid buildup into a world power in the 1800s. Other countries were shocked at the speed and veracity in which the United States went to dominate the globe. France sent a diplomat to investigate it for a few months, and he ended up spending years here and went on to write one of the most famous books in US history on it: Democracy In America. The US became this economic powerhouse due to a number of reasons. Democracy, vast resources, a patriotic populace. But as noted in Democracy In America, and espoused by our founding fathers, the main reason is none other than free market capitalism. Two of the biggest actions by the government to stray away from folowing free markets, was the beginning of regulating wall street in 1911, which turned it from a gambler’s game to a legitimized government backed entity that has had effects we see even to this day, and the ratification of the constitution to allow income tax, passed in 1913. Since then, prohibitions, wars on poverty, public education systems, wars on drugs. International wars, more taxes to pay for those wars, meddling in higher education, and involvement in healthcare have convoluted the markets so much, it’s caused a multitude of economic crises we see today. The economists to follow The country is facing a myriad of wealth and inequality issues, yet the people it effects seem to have no concern for studying economic theory or policy. As a result, republicans and democrats alike continue to be elected that follow economic ideas that are proven failures, or stray from the original economic philosophies that made America great in the first place. The most important economist in American history no doubt, is Adam Smith. Though the never actually set foot in America, his teachings shaped the principles that the founding fathers based the country on. Free markets, non government roles in the market, the invisible hand theory, and modern capitalism. Born in Scotland in 1723, Smith showed intelligence that surpassed his pupils. At just 14, he entered the University of Glasgow where he studied moral philosophy. He went on to be a famous professor, and then quit teaching to travel Europe studying how different government’s economic policies had different effects on it’s people. In Paris he met Benjamin Franklin, who was also becoming more and more of a believer in free markets himself. It was at this time that the french phrase on economics “Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself”came to be. Though the United States strayed from his teachings in the latter part of the 20th century, Wealth Of Nations was instrumental in the establishment of the USA as we know it. Ludwig Von Mises Ludwig Von Mises is considered one of the greatest economists of the past two centuries. He was born in Austria in 1881 to jewish parents in what was then part of Austria-Hungary but now Ukraine. Highly intelligent, at age 12 he was fluent in German, French, Polish, spoke some Latin, and understand Ukrainian. His treatise on economics would go on to be one of the most influential books on free market capitalism in modern history. Other notable economists which Americans should study are Milton Friedman, Thomas Woods, Ayn Rand (just as one does not have to agree with the whole bible to be a christian, or an artist to like their music, there are lessons in Ayn Rand’s books that make her personal opinions irrelevant and that are why she is as famous as she is today). Study these works, for America’s future depends on it."
New Chinese “Megavirus” arrives in this US City as death toll rises,928,"A new Chinese “Megavirus” is making many people very nervous, and has become a major health concern for everyone in contact with anyone with “Coronavirus.” 17 have died from this dangerous virus, which is much like SARS. It causes respiratory ailments, vomiting, and a high fever. Now 1 person in Washington has caught it and brought it to the US after visiting China! Persident Trump has weighed in: How to stay safe: Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing."
Former NHS socialist director died while waiting for operation,1728,"

 The Former NHS director has died while waiting for an operation for over 9 months, and it happened in her own hospital. Margaret Hutchon had her surgery cancelled 4 times already.
Her husband Jim reported that she was healthy the week prior to her death but that the delays destroyed her health. What is most ironic is that she died in the hospital where she serves as non-executive member of the board of directors. She was due for a followup surgery to stomach ulcers at the Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex.
Now her completely devastated husband, Jim, is asking for answer in regards to her operations and the delays. After the first surgery, she languished in the hospital for so long, her family become worried she was becoming institutionalized and brought her home to live until her second operation. ‘From July to October there was talk of another operation and then between November and December there were three or four postponements and she was becoming so institutionalised we decided to get her home until an operation was certain. ‘It was a blessing because although neither of is could have guessed it – it gave us a last month together. ‘Nevertheless, she was unable to take proper nourishment and went into the operation on the better side of a low state – she was very weak.’  Mike Mackrory, a fellow Liberal Democrat councillor, said: We were all stunned to hear she had died after the operation. There were constant delays she had to endure before surgery. ‘We were given the very sad news and as word spread it threw a pall over the civic dinner. Margaret was much loved and respected in this town.’  A spokesman for Broomfield Hospital said it could not comment on individual cases. see also:

President Trump Defends Jack Wilson from Michael Bloomberg,751,"Mr. Trump defended Jack Wilson from Michael Bloomberg Mr. Bloomberg talked about the incident that happened on West Freeway Church of Christ, on his address in Montgomery, Ala., on Jan. 1.

“It may be true that someone in the congregation had his own gun and killed the person who murdered two other people, but it’s the job of law enforcement to have guns and to decide when to shoot”

“You do not want a civilian carrying a gun in a crowded place”

While Mr. Bloomberg doesn’t acknowledge the serious mental health crisis that America has, he also doesn’t want to believe that a civilian needs protection from people who wants to harm them. Stories like Mr. Wilson is proof that we need guns to protect each other from the evils that lurk around us

"Joe Biden: We Need More Illegal Immigrants, Should Bring Back Obamacare Fines",1151,"Joe Biden is really doubling down on the more controversial planks for his platform. The Democratic party primary candidate came out saying that if he was president he would allow more illegal immigration. He also came out in support of returning Obamacare fines as well, making him swinging much more left than he has in previous years. 

 There’s a new doctor in the house. It’s Joe Biden. Joe said he vehemently supported bringing back the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate. He came out earlier last year in support of returning the highly unpopular plank of Obamacare, and now he’s doubling down. Republicans ultimately gutted the regulation once taking majority power. “Yes, I’d bring back the individual mandate,” Biden said in an interview with CNN. “The individual mandate would be popular now, compared to what’s being offered,” he added. Last summer, he grabbed headlines for backing up the mandate. Now with his possible democratic party nomination, it seems more close to reality should he unseat the popular President Trump in November. Biden also wants to give illegals free healthcare as well, according to the same interviews.

"Latest Milennial Pollings: 66% Unaware of Auschwitz, 70% support Socialism",1577,"Latest polling doesn’t look good for milennials. A sleuth of polls surfing the web have milennials as what some could call the braindeadest generation. 70% of Milennials say they would support a socialist candidate for president of the United States. This would make sense, after a video released today exposing a bernie campaign staffer talking about putting Trump supporters in gulags and reeducation camps. Milennials have struggled in the past to identify the definitions of socialism, but candidates for president in recent years like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have brought socialism front and center in politics. The idea of free healthcare, college, and almost every other commodity has appealed to the younger audience. The second shocking poll done has revealed that 66% of milennials also don’t know what Auschwitz was. The Nazi Concentration Camp was notorious during the war. Over a million jewish prisoners were exterminated in the camp. Some numbers put the victim death toll at 1.5 million. Auschwitz was used by the nazis as a facility to kill jews throughout Europe in fast and efficient time. It was part of the Nazi effort to ethnically cleanse european countries. The poll asked US millenials if they could identify what Auschwitz was. Only 44% correctly could. This is according to The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany The study goes on to show different levels of ignorance by mainstream Americans and specifically millennials as to details about the holocaust or what the holocaust even was.

"Money Can’t Buy Him Love; Low turnout, unhappy audiences, and bad polling for Mike Bloomberg",3769,"Bloomberg has a problem. He’s spent a whopping $200,000,000 since announcing his campaign 7 weeks ago, and nothing is going right. Not even 50 people showed up to Bloomberg’s kickoff event for President in Texas when the Democrat turned Republican turned Independent turned Democrat started his campaign officially in San Antonio, Texas. The billionaire held his first event in a San Antonio venue called Viva Villa Restaurant. The gathering had been hyped up by the campaign for some time, and the Bloomberg team publicized the event to supporters. There was one problem though. Almost nobody showed up. The venue ended up having an audience of less than 50 people. 45 in total according to reporters at the event. Not the showing a candidate running for president wants to have as their grand day one event. The Washington Examiner was the first newspaper to point out the dismal numbers for the former Mayor, calling it a small gathering. Other media outlets have opted to ignore the turnout. Even more troubling for the campaign, Bloomberg brought in high profile supporter Judge Judy to help drum up an audience, and this failed.  “When I’m in the Oval Office, no more tweeting,” Bloomberg promised the gathering. “Actually I can’t spell very well,” he admitted. “So that’s relatively easy to do.” He then went on the offensive against President Trump. “We are here to win this election and I am running to defeat Donald Trump,” Bloomberg said. “We’re going to finally turn Texas blue.” The small following applauded the announcement. Bloomberg has chosen many unconventional pages out of the campaign playbook. He jumped in late as the Democratic Primary has begun winding down in prep for the primaries. He is also choosing to altogether skip the first couple primaries that are seen as essential for a candidate for president. The billionaire is estimated to be worth over $50 billion. In the seven weeks since he announced his campaign, he’s guessed to have burned through $200,000,000 of it. At the event in Texas, Bloomberg promised to be soft of illegal immigration, tough on gun rights, and expand big government for health care. “When the law was written, the internet and gun shows didn’t exist, and so the (current) law doesn’t apply to them. That’s the only thing that we need changed,” he said. And on his his online front, he’s facing scrutiny now for a homepage photo flop. Bloomberg’s cover photo for the homepage of his website stands out, but not for a reason he might want. The image shows billionaire presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg speaking to an assumed audience. Also in the photo, appear a number of people with Bloomberg For President memorabilia who look like supporters. Except the looks on their faces say anything but. In the carefully picked photo of african americans, women, men whites, hispanics, eldery and teenagers,  their faces all resemble the same expression. The first is a young men of light brown complexion, possibly in his early twenties. He has a Bloomberg shirt on, but is looking away sadly from Mike speak. The second attendee has her eyes closed and is pouting.  The third is a middle aged minority male in a suit. He also gives out an unhappy look and stares away from Mike and the camera. There’s a kid behind them who looks confused. Another teen who looks befuddled on why he’s there. A women also with her eyes closed. And a final young adult who looks bored. From the look of the photo, not one of Bloomberg’s supporters look at all enthusiastic to be there. Considering this is the image chosen to be on the homepage of his website, one must wonder what the bad photos looked like.
