Taliban fire in air to scatter hundreds of protesters in Kabul,5504,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - Taliban gunmen fired in the air on Tuesday to scatter protesters in the Afghan capital Kabul, witnesses said, as video showed scores scurrying to escape volleys of gunfire. Hundreds of men and women shouting slogans such as ""Long live the resistance"" and ""Death to Pakistan"" marched in the streets to protest against the Taliban takeover. Neighbouring Pakistan has deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of assisting the Islamist group's return to power - charges it denies. ""The Islamic government is shooting at our poor people,"" one panic-stricken woman on the street says over sounds of gunfire in a video clip shown on Iranian television news. There were no immediate reports of injuries, however. The Taliban's rapid advance across Afghanistan as U.S. forces pulled out last month triggered a scramble to leave by people fearing reprisals. U.S.-led foreign forces evacuated about 124,000 foreigners and at-risk Afghans, but tens of thousands were left behind. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was in contact with about 100 Americans who were still in Afghanistan. About 1,000 people, including Americans, have been stuck in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif for days awaiting clearance for charter flights to leave, an organiser told Reuters, blaming the delay on the U.S. State Department. Blinken, holding talks in Qatar, a key interlocutor with the Taliban, said the problem was one of documents. ""My understanding is that the Taliban have not denied exit to anyone holding a valid document, but they have said those without valid documents, at this point, can't leave,"" he told reporters. read more ""Because all of these people are grouped together, that's meant that flights have not been allowed to go ... We are not aware of anyone being held on an aircraft, or any hostage-like situation."" AIRPORT RESTART At the same news conference, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said no deal had yet been reached with the Taliban on how Qatar and its partner Turkey could get Kabul airport running again. ""We hope in the next few days we can get to a level where the airport is up and running for passengers and for humanitarian aid as well,"" he said. Turkey says it wants to provide security inside the airport to protect any Turkish staff and safeguard operations, but that the Taliban have insisted no foreign forces can be present. read more On Monday, the Islamist militants claimed victory in the Panjshir valley, the last province holding out against it, and promised to name a government soon. A woman chants from inside of a car during the anti-Pakistan protest in Kabul, Afghanistan, September 7, 2021. WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS Pictures on social media showed Taliban members standing in front of the Panjshir governor's compound after days of fighting with the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), commanded by Panjshiri leader Ahmad Massoud. Massoud denied that his force, consisting of remnants of the Afghan army as well as local militia fighters, was beaten. ""We are in Panjshir and our resistance will continue,"" he tweeted. He said he was safe but did not say where. The Taliban have repeatedly sought to reassure Afghans and foreign countries that they will not return to the brutality of their last reign two decades ago, marked by violent public punishments and the barring of women and girls from public life. But more than three weeks after seizing Kabul, they have yet to set out their plans. Asked whether Washington would recognise the Taliban, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday: ""That’s a long way off."" STUDENTS SEGREGATED Teachers and students at universities in Afghanistan's largest cities - Kabul, Kandahar and Herat - told Reuters that female students were being segregated in class with curtains, taught separately or limited to some campus areas. ""Putting up curtains is not acceptable,"" Anjila, a 21-year-old female student at Kabul University, said by telephone, adding that women had sat apart from males in classrooms before the Taliban took over, but without barriers. read more ""I really felt terrible when I entered the class ... We are gradually going back to 20 years ago."" The conflict in Afghanistan, coupled with drought and coronavirus, has left 18 million people - almost half the population - in need of humanitarian aid, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said. It said tens of thousands of families had headed for relief camps in urban areas, but found they had neither food nor income. read more ""Basic services in Afghanistan are collapsing and food and other lifesaving aid is about to run out,"" Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a news conference in Geneva, urging more aid ahead of an international donor conference on Sept. 13. read more The World Health Organisation is liaising with Qatar on deliveries of urgently needed medical supplies, WHO regional emergency director Rick Brennan said. Drought and war have forced about 5.5 million Afghans to flee their homes, including more than 550,000 newly displaced in 2021, the International Organization for Migration says. Western powers say they are prepared to send humanitarian aid, but that broader economic engagement depends on the shape and actions of the Taliban government.

UK PM Johnson raises taxes to tackle health and social care crisis,4880,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out plans on Tuesday to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors to try to fix a health and social care funding crisis, angering some in his governing party by breaking an election promise. After spending huge amounts of money to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson is returning to an election pledge to address Britain's creaking social care system, where costs are projected to double as the population ages over the next two decades. He also moved to try to tackle a backlog in Britain's health system, which has seen millions waiting months for treatment from the state-run National Health Service, after resources were refocused to deal with COVID-19. ""It would be wrong for me to say that we can pay for this recovery without taking the difficult but responsible decisions about how we finance it,"" Johnson told parliament. ""It would be irresponsible to meet the costs from higher borrowing and higher debt,"" he said, outlining increases that broke a promise made in his Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto not to raise such levies to fund social care. British politicians have tried for years to find a way to pay for social care, though successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers have ducked the issue because they feared it would anger voters and their own parties. Ignoring disquiet in his party, Johnson outlined what he described as a new health and social care levy that will see the rate of National Insurance payroll taxes paid by both workers and employers rise by 1.25 percentage points, with the same increase also applied to the tax on shareholder dividends. read more He said the increases would raise 36 billion pounds ($50 billion) over three years. The pound fell against the euro and dollar after the announced measures, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies said would increase Britain's tax burden to 35% of GDP - a peacetime record. Johnson has tried to cool anger within his party, which has for decades positioned itself as a defender of low taxes, over the hikes, which some lawmakers fear could lose them support at an election due in 2024. Parliament will debate the measures further on Wednesday. MANIFESTO BREAKING Johnson explained that elderly Britons would no longer face crippling care costs that have forced many to sell their homes, and said he could not have predicted the coronavirus pandemic which has further stretched services. ""You can't fix health and social care without long-term reform. The plan I'm setting out today will fix all of those problems together,"" he said, to jeers and laughter from opposition Labour Party lawmakers. ""I accept that this breaks a manifesto commitment which is not something I do lightly, but a global pandemic was in no one's manifesto."" Shortly afterwards, his work and pensions minister, Therese Coffey, said Britain would not raise state retirement pensions in line with earnings next year, breaking another election commitment to maintain the so-called ""triple lock"". read more Labour leader Keir Starmer was quick to pounce on Conservative fears. ""This is a tax rise that breaks a promise that the prime minister made at the last election ... Read my lips, the Tories (Conservatives) can never again claim to be the party of low tax,"" Starmer said. Some British businesses said the rise in national insurance would only compound damage done to firms by the pandemic. read more ""This rise will impact the wider economic recovery by landing significant costs on firms when they are already facing a raft of new cost pressures and dampen the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the recovery,"" said Suren  Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Trade body Make UK said the move might put jobs at risk just as pandemic job support programmes end. ""Putting a tax on jobs and workers at a time when Government is pulling the furlough scheme is ill-timed as well as illogical,"" its chief executive Stephen Phipson said. Like many Western leaders, Johnson is facing demands to spend more on welfare even though government borrowing has ballooned to 14.2% of economic output - a level last seen at the end of World War Two. For Johnson, who helped win the 2016 Brexit vote and then as prime minister presided over Britain's exit from the European Union, fixing social care for the elderly and disabled ""once and for all"" offers a possible way to broaden his domestic legacy. In 2019, Johnson said he had a social care plan. Two years later, his proposals are a gamble. Critics say Johnson is expanding state spending again without any clear reform of the way social care is administered, and that the rise in National Insurance payments will disproportionately hit the young people and lower paid workers. read more ($1 = 0.7261 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
World's top three Christian leaders in climate appeal ahead of U.N. summit,2885,"VATICAN CITY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The world's three main Christian leaders issued an unprecedented joint appeal to members of their Churches to ""listen to the cry of the earth"" and back action to stem the effects of climate change. In ""A Joint Message for the Protection of Creation,"" Pope Francis, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew asked Christians to pray that world leaders at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November make courageous choices. ""We call on everyone, whatever their belief or world view, to endeavour to listen to the cry of the earth and of people who are poor, examining their behaviour and pledging meaningful sacrifices for the sake of the earth which God has given us,"" the message said. Francis heads the 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, Bartholomew is the spiritual leader of the world's some 220 million Orthodox Christians and Welby is the senior bishop of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which has about 85 million members. All three have been very active in environmental affairs and concur that climate change and global warming is at least partially caused by human activities such as the use of fossil fuels. ""We stand before a harsh justice: biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and climate change are the inevitable consequences of our actions, since we have greedily consumed more of the earth’s resources than the planet can endure,"" the message said. It said recent extreme weather events, natural disasters, floods, fires, droughts and rising sea levels have shown that ""climate change is not only a future challenge, but an immediate and urgent matter of survival."" Europe had its warmest summer on record this year, though only by a small margin over two previous highest temperatures for June-August, European Union scientists said earlier on Tuesday, and green groups have called for the COP26 conference to be postponed. read more Typically delegates from more than 190 countries attend the annual talks, yet with many countries grappling with COVID-19 and poorer nations struggling to access vaccines, it should be delayed, the Climate Action Network (CAN) said. Scotland's bishops have said Pope Francis, who underwent intestinal surgery in July, will take part in the Glasgow conference, health permitting. read more A spokeswoman for Welby said he would attend. Bartholomew's office did not immediately respond to an email about his plans. On Oct. 4, the Vatican will host a major gathering of world religious leaders and scientists to take a common stand to raise the stakes ahead of the Glasgow conference. Called ""Faith and Science: Towards COP26,"" is being organised by Britain and Italy. It will bring together some 40 leaders from the world's major religions and 10 scientists.

Canada's Trudeau hit by gravel on campaign trail dogged by anti-vax hecklers,2831,"OTTAWA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hit by a handful of gravel on Monday, television images show, as he made his way to his campaign bus past a crowd shouting their opposition to COVID-19 vaccines. A CTV camera captured what looks to be white gravel hitting Trudeau and one of his bodyguards as he walked toward his campaign bus in London, Ontario. The Liberals canceled an event late last month because of safety concerns linked to anti-vax protesters. Trudeau played down the incident on his plane later, saying he may have been hit on the shoulder, and once he had pumpkin seeds thrown at him, according to a video posted on Twitter by Global News TV reporter Abigail Bimman. Earlier on Monday, Trudeau assailed Conservative leader Erin O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates, including for his own candidates, and called the hecklers ""angry mobs"" of anti-vaxxers. ""Erin O'Toole is at least taking some of his cues from (the anti-vax crowd),"" Trudeau said. Around 74% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated, but a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic is currently building, mostly among the unvaccinated. Trudeau, 49, also criticised O'Toole on Monday for waffling on gun control as the campaign enters its final stretch ahead of the Sept. 20 election, with the Liberals and Conservatives running virtually neck-and-neck in the polls. O'Toole on Sunday scrapped a campaign promise to eliminate a ban on some assault weapons, a sensitive issue in Canada after several mass shootings in recent years. Trudeau sought to capitalize on his opponent's shift with just two weeks left to reverse his fortunes. read more O'Toole ""will say anything to try and get elected,"" Trudeau told supporters at a campaign event in southern Ontario, Canada's most populous province. ""That's not leadership. That's not integrity."" Speaking in Ottawa, O'Toole refused to say how many of his candidates had not been inoculated. He has said those who are not vaccinated must be tested daily. ""Our approach, with respect to vaccinations, is we try and encourage and inform and work with people, but we will respect their personal health decisions,"" O'Toole said. Liberal strategists have said the crucial period of the campaign starts after Labor Day, because Canadians have been more focused until now on their summer vacations than the election. There are two debates this week, one in French and one in English, the only occasions left in which all the candidates will face one another on national television ahead of the vote. A rolling Nanos Research survey of 1,200 people for CTV on Monday put the Liberals at 34.1% and the Conservatives at 32%, a reversal from a day earlier, when Liberals were at 33.4% compared with 34.9% for Conservatives.

UK employers say Johnson's tax hike will cost jobs,2337,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British business organisations criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to increase taxes to pay for health and social care reform, saying they added to the burden on firms struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would cost jobs. Johnson set out plans on Tuesday to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors. read more The announcement received a cool reception from businesses, who were asked to pay a 1.25 percentage-point increase to a payroll tax known as National Insurance (NI). ""Businesses strongly oppose a rise in national insurance contributions as it will be a drag anchor on jobs growth at an absolutely crucial time,"" Suren  Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said. ""This rise will impact the wider economic recovery by landing significant costs on firms when they are already facing a raft of new cost pressures and dampen the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the recovery."" But the government said it was right that businesses should make a contribution given that they benefit from the health and social care system via their employees. Big businesses would bear the largest burden of the tax rise, Johnson said. A government document published alongside the announcement said 70% of the money raised from businesses will come from the largest 1% of companies and around 40% of businesses would not be affected at all by the levy. ""Those earning more pay more and larger businesses also contribute,"" Sunak said on Twitter. The tax increases also included a 1.25 percentage point rise in dividend tax rates which stands to affect business owners and investors who rely on dividend income. Manufacturers' group Make UK said the measures would hinder Britain's recovery from its worst economic slump in more than 300 years in 2020. ""Economic history tells us that job cuts are most likely when the economy starts to open again after a downturn because firms need the capital to reset,"" said Chief Executive Stephen Phipson. ""After witnessing large-scale redundancies at the height of the pandemic and the plug being pulled on the furlough scheme, government should be putting in place measures to protect jobs and incentivise recruitment. An increase to NI would have the opposite effect"". Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Sweden to remove most remaining pandemic restrictions this month,1809,"STOCKHOLM, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Sweden will push ahead with easing COVID-19 restrictions at the end of this month, removing most curbs and limits on public venues such as restaurants, theatres and stadiums, the government said on Tuesday. With most adults vaccinated, Sweden has gradually eased some restrictions during a summer lull in the pandemic. While it has seen infections mount in recent weeks amid the rapid spread of the more contagious Delta variant, deaths from the disease have remained low. Sweden has been an outlier in aspects of its handling of the disease, shunning hard lockdowns throughout the pandemic and relying heavily on voluntary recommendations regarding issues such as social distancing and hygiene. However, public gatherings such as concerts, sporting events and venues such as bars and restaurants have operated under tight crowd limits, curbs that are now set to be removed on Sept. 29, along with a recommendation to work from home. ""The important message is that we now take further steps in the return to normal everyday life,"" Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. ""Our view has all the time been that restrictions should be lifted as soon as possible."" Hallengren said the government was also looking into the possible use of vaccination certificates for some activities, though it hoped these would not be necessary to impose in a country with a long history of high vaccination rates. About 70% of Swedes aged 16 and above are fully vaccinated. Sweden has suffered many times more COVID-19 deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, which opted for tighter curbs during the initial waves of the pandemic, but less than many larger European countries that employed hard lockdowns.

Factbox: Global big banks plot back-to-office plans as vaccines roll out,5516,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - The biggest banks in the world plan to reopen their offices, emboldened by aggressive vaccination drives and falling COVID-19 cases in major financial hubs, after sending most employees home early last year to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. The COVID-19 Delta variant's spread is prompting some firms to rethink their back-to-office plans, but many of Wall Street's biggest banks are sticking to their decision to bring back employees. Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions: UNITED STATES Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) The bank has pushed back its U.S. return-to-office date to Oct. 18. read more Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) The bank planned to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June. read more JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) The largest U.S. bank has brought back employees in the United States to the office on a rotational basis from July.

NatWest (NWG.L) CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate. The bank will adopt its new ways of working over the summer, with the majority of staff in England and Wales expected to be back in the office from September, dependent on government and public health advice, a spokesperson said. GERMANY Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) Deutsche Bank in London had plans to bring more staff back from June 21, assuming the city's lockdown restrictions were loosened, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Germany's largest lender has also told its U.S. investment bankers that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The bank earlier said it was following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries.

"Squeaking, hairless and pink: twin giant pandas born at Madrid Zoo",1089,"MADRID, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Twin giant panda cubs were born at Madrid's zoo on Monday in a boost to conservation efforts for the vulnerable species, whose numbers have been rebounding thanks to an international captive breeding programme. The pair, whose sex is yet to be determined, are the fifth and sixth cubs of Madrid's female panda Hua Zui Ba and her partner Bing Xing, the zoo said. After four hours of labour, the first cub was born around 8:30 a.m., while the second followed four hours later in what the zoo described as a ""peaceful"" birth. Two technicians from China's Chengdu panda breeding base will assist local veterinarians in checking the health of the pink, hairless newborns, who will be totally dependent on their mother for the first four months of their life. In July, Chinese conservationists announced they no longer considered pandas to be an endangered species, upgrading their status a notch to vulnerable.

Planned Parenthood wins restraining order against Texas anti-abortion group,2170,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred an anti-abortion group from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce a near-total ban on abortion in the state, handing the nation's largest abortion provider a small victory in the bitter legal fight. Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted Planned Parenthood a temporary restraining order against the anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, blocking the group and its allies from using an unusual mechanism of the Texas law that enables private citizens to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices are closer than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected. Guerra Gamble said in her three-page written order that allowing the so-called private enforcement mechanism to go forward while Planned Parenthood took further legal action would cause ""probable, irreparable and imminent injury"" that could not be cured later. The unusual enforcement mechanism gives the civil enforcement power to any party in or out of Texas who chooses to sue, while preventing government officials from enforcing the ban. The Travis County restraining order does not bar others from using the law against Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers in Texas. A hearing on a possible further injunction was set for Sept. 13. Helene Krasnoff, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president for public policy litigation and law, expressed relief ""that the Travis County district court has acted quickly to grant this restraining order against Texas Right to Life and anyone working with them as deputized enforcers of this draconian law."" ""But make no mistake: this is not enough relief for Texas,"" she said. Elizabeth Graham, a Texas Right to Life vice president, said in a statement that her group ""will never back down from protecting pregnant women and preborn children from abortion.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Theranos founder's defense may turn on state of mind, experts say",4423,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - As Elizabeth Holmes' fraud trial gets underway this week, lawyers for the former Silicon Valley entrepreneur may try to show she was a true believer in the blood-testing technology at her startup Theranos Inc, and never intended to defraud investors and patients, legal experts said. On Wednesday, federal jurors in San Jose, California will hear opening arguments in the case against the Stanford University dropout who once dazzled Silicon Valley and is now charged with misleading investors and patients by falsely claiming that the company's printer-sized devices could run a range of tests and produce accurate results using a single drop of blood. To defeat the charges, Holmes' attorneys are likely to home in on what she herself believed about the complex science, according to several defense attorneys. ""The best way to argue a defense in a science-based case is to suggest that this young woman had a good faith belief that this science was real,"" said defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman, who is not involved in the case. Holmes, 37, founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19, and prosecutors allege she told the company's private investors several lies, including that Theranos did not need U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its devices. Holmes is also accused of having defrauded patients by leading them to think blood tests from Theranos machines were more accurate than they were. The most serious charges of wire fraud require prosecutors to prove Holmes acted with intent to defraud. To be convicted, the jury of twelve must unanimously find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In court filings, Holmes' attorneys have argued there is a missing link between what Holmes herself knew and what Theranos employees told doctors and regulators about the company's technology. ""Corporate executives generally do not face individual criminal liability for the actions and statements of a corporation's agents or employees, and that principle holds equally true in this case,"" they wrote. Holmes' lawyers said last year that she was ""highly likely"" to take the stand in her own defense, a move that experts called risky. It could backfire if jurors do not view her as credible and give prosecutors latitude to bring in a broader range of evidence, they said. Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes leaves after a hearing at a federal court in San Jose, California, July 17, U.S., 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam Brafman said that distancing Holmes from testimony about patients who were adversely affected by the company's claims will be crucial if she is to be acquitted. Where there is no doubt about a fact such as an inaccurate test result, Brafman said the defense should ""take it on the chin"" and bring jurors back to questioning what Holmes knew. ""You pick battles in a trial that you have a chance of winning. The best way to confront really horrifying testimony is to not make the trial about that,"" Brafman said. JURORS' SYMPATHY Filings unsealed on the eve of trial showed that Holmes may also invoke allegations of sexual and psychological abuse by her former romantic partner, ex-Theranos executive Sunny ""Ramesh"" Balwani, as part of her defense. Holmes told a psychologist that Balwani was controlling, ""monitoring her calls, text messages, and emails; physical violence, such as throwing hard, sharp objects at her; restricting her sleep,"" according to a filing from February 2020 by Balwani's lawyers, who said the allegations required separate trials. Balwani, who has denied the allegations, is scheduled to be tried separately next year. His attorney did not respond to request for comment. Holmes' attorneys said her ""deference"" to Balwani shaped what she believed about financial models he created, and about the Theranos-Walgreens partnership he led, which prosecutors say the pair oversold to investors. Amanda Kramer, a former prosecutor in New York who has handled both securities fraud and sex trafficking cases, said that regardless of whether jurors are convinced that evidence of alleged abuse adds up to a defense, hearing such testimony ""could garner sympathy for Elizabeth Holmes, and that is not a small thing at all."" ""Because no matter their duty, that is going to influence the way they hear the evidence, and ultimately the way they deliberate and cast their votes at the end of the trial,"" she said.

Factbox: How does the UK government plan to pay for health and social care?,3196,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday set out plans to raise taxes on workers, companies and some shareholders by 12 billion pounds ($16.5 billion) a year to try to tackle a backlog in the health system and fix how Britain's adult social care is funded. read more Below are the details of the government's plans: HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE LEVY From April 2022 the government will introduce new 1.25% levies on both earned income and on employers' wage bills to raise funds for health and social care. The levy will be based on National Insurance contributions and will be paid by working adults including - from 2023 - those over state pension age. NATIONAL INSURANCE RISE In order to bring the money in as quickly as possible, for the first year the levy will be raised via a temporary hike in National Insurance social security contributions, and then from April 2023 it will become a separate levy. The rates of National Insurance contributions will increase by 1.25 percentage points for both employers and employees until April 2023, when it will revert back to its existing level. National Insurance is not paid by people who are over pension age but still working. The government said that in 2022-23, a typical basic rate taxpayer earning the median basic-rate taxpayer's income of 24,100 pounds would pay an extra 180 pounds in National Insurance, while a typical higher-rate taxpayer earning the median higher rate taxpayer’s income of 67,100 pounds would be expected to pay an extra 715 pounds. DIVIDEND TAX RISE From April 2022 the government will also raise by 1.25 percentage points the rate of tax paid by individuals who receive dividend income from shares. Shares held in tax-exempt savings accounts known as ISAs are not subject to dividend tax. Due to a 2,000 pound tax-free allowance for dividend income, around 60% of people with dividend income outside of ISAs would not be affected, the government said. HOW MUCH MONEY WILL IT RAISE? The government said the new measures would raise around 36 billion pounds over the next three years, of which 5.4 billion pounds would be invested in adult social care. Of the 12 billion pounds on average raised per year, the government said around 11.4 billion pounds would come from the levy and around 0.6 billion pounds from the increase to dividend tax rates. The government said Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would receive an extra 2.2 billion pounds each year on average as a result of the health and social care package. HOW MUCH WILL PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TOWARDS THEIR CARE? Previously people were not eligible for help with the cost of care if they had savings worth more than 23,250 pounds. Under the new plans, from October 2023 anyone with assets under 20,000 pounds will have their care costs fully covered by the state. Those with between 20,000 and 100,000 pounds of assets will have to contribute towards the cost of their care but will also receive means-tested state support on a tapered basis. The government said no one would have to pay more than 86,000 pounds towards the cost of their care over their lifetime. ($1 = 0.7256 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pound extends day's losses after UK announces tax hikes,2735,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The pound dipped for a second consecutive day against a broadly stronger dollar on Tuesday and hit its lowest in over six weeks against the euro, with most of the currency's losses coming after the British government set out a plan to raise taxes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out plans to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors to try to fix the health and social care system, angering some in his governing party by breaking an election promise. read more Johnson outlined what he described as a new health and social care levy, which will see the rate of National Insurance payroll taxes paid by workers and employers rise by 1.25 percentage points. The same increase will be applied to the tax on shareholder dividends. Sterling, already trading lower on the day, dropped as much as 0.5% against the dollar to $1.3768. It fell to its lowest against the euro since July 21, down 0.2% at 86.14 pence. ""We are seeing the narrative of the (economic) recovery process being tested by a tax hike which potentially could take liquidity or money out of the system, so that news flow isn't particularly helpful,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC World Markets. ""Whenever you do get signs of political friction then invariably that does result in a degree of susceptibility to downside for cable,"" Stretch added. Hawkish comments from BoE policymaker Michael Saunders did not have a sizeable impact on the pound. Saunders said the central bank may need to raise interest rates next year if growth continues and inflation becomes stickier. read more ""I would assume that the market sees Saunders as an outlier on the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee), thus feels no need to reprice hawkishly based on what he's said,"" said Michael Brown, senior market analyst at Caxton FX. Bets that Britain's rapid pace of COVID-19 vaccinations would lead to a faster economic reopening and rebound had earlier propelled sterling to one of the best performing G10 currencies this year. But recent surveys have hardened indications of slowing economic growth, after a strong rebound triggered by the country's rapid vaccine rollout earlier in the year. They also reveal that economic momentum is stuttering under the impact of Brexit, global supply chain issues and COVID-19 isolation rules. On Monday, sterling dipped on the back of a survey of purchasing managers that showed the UK construction industry grew last month at its weakest pace since the lockdown of early 2021, hit by a severe shortage of building supplies. read more Friday PMI data had showed growth in the services sector slowed down in August compared with July. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK's Sunak to set out spending and budget plans on Oct. 27,1109,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak will deliver a three-year spending review and a budget plan on Oct. 27 as he tries to reconcile demand for more spending on health and other services with his promise to fix the pandemic hit to the public finances. The finance ministry said Sunak would outline his plans alongside Britain's latest official economic forecasts. Including extra funding for health and social care announced earlier on Tuesday, core day-to-day spending, adjusted for inflation, would grow by nearly 4% per year over the course of the current, five-year parliament, the ministry said. This represented the largest real-terms increase in spending of any parliament since 2001, it added. Sunak said his Spending Review plan would keep the public finances on a sustainable path and did not envisage higher spending than announced so far. Government departments would have to identify cuts of at least 5% from day-to-day budgets in order to free up funds for reinvestment in priority areas, the finance ministry said.

Vaccine makers should supply shots for trials to help spur sector -CEPI,2646,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccine makers ought to make their approved shots available for trials or risk hobbling the development of more vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said on Tuesday. Major vaccine studies have so far examined COVID-19 infection rates comparing the prospective vaccine with a placebo. But such trials may no longer be considered ethical in countries where an effective vaccine is widely available. Instead, new vaccines would need to be tested in comparison to an established shot, said CEPI, which was launched in 2017 to fund epidemic vaccine development and is funded by countries as well as by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. read more ""Lack of access to comparator vaccines is already stalling the development of promising vaccine candidates, and the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccine development and supply is huge,"" Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI, said in a statement, a version of which waspublished as a letter to the editors of scientific journal Nature. Established vaccines have been sold under supply contracts that do not foresee use in clinical trials, according to CEPI. ""Thus far, vaccine manufacturers have been reluctant to change this arrangement, threatening to bring vital COVID-19 vaccine R&D to a standstill,"" CEPI's Saville said. An exception appears to be AstraZeneca, whose shot developed along with Oxford University has been obtained as a comparator for planned or ongoing trials, including by Italy's ReiThera Srl, Valneva (VLS.PA) of France, Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics (6547.TWO) and South Korea's SK Bioscience (302440.KS). When asked to comment on the CEPI remarks, AstraZeneca said it ""continues to collaborate with the industry and share resources to tackle the pandemic"". A Valneva spokesperson said the trial was recruited quickly and she was not aware of difficulties in procuring the AstraZeneca doses. The other main Western COVID-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE), Moderna (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) - did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CEPI's U.S. director, Nicole Lurie, told Reuters that companies selling approved vaccines are not motivated to assist trials that could lead to the development of a competing product. Countries should renegotiate contracts with manufacturers to let them use doses in trials, she said. Volumes in the tens of thousands of doses would make a huge difference for trials, small compared to the hundreds of millions being delivered, she added.

Filibuster imperils Pelosi's abortion bill in U.S. Senate - Klobuchar,2136,"WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate's filibuster rule likely imperils a bill intended to protect abortion rights that Democrats are readying following the Supreme Court's decision not to block a strict new Texas ban, a leading Democratic senator said on Sunday. Senator Amy Klobuchar told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that some Senate Republicans support abortion rights but not enough to overcome the chamber's rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. The nation's 6-3 conservative top court this week allowed Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect, which observers said showed the justices may be ready to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a national right to abortion. That decision led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that the Democratic-controlled chamber will soon debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping similar state anti-abortion regulations. But Klobuchar said that bill faces little to no chance of passing the Senate. ""My solution to this ... I believe we should abolish the filibuster,"" Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Rules Committee, told CNN. ""I do not believe an archaic rule should be used to allow us to put our heads in the sand ... and not take action on these important issues ... We just will get nowhere if we keep this filibuster in place."" Progressive Democrats have repeatedly over the past year suggested doing away with the filibuster to allow other Democratic priorities to pass, including a voting rights bill intended to counteract a wave of new voting restrictions passed by Republican-governed states. Senate moderates, including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have rejected that idea, however. Klobuchar said one way to discourage the frequency of filibusters would be to make senators who object to ending debate actually stay on the floor debating. This ""talking filibuster"" was the tradition until the 1970s. She said another approach would be a ""carveout"" that would only change the filibuster for legislation directly tied to one subject, such as abortion rights.

Court orders Alaska agency to examine Hilcorp pipeline leak,2265,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Alaska regulators must probe a Hilcorp Energy Company pipeline that has repeatedly leaked natural gas into Cook Inlet, the state Supreme Court ruled on Friday. The court said the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission improperly rejected a petition for a hearing on a leak that lasted for several months in 2017. The AOGCC, which regulates oil and gas production, provided “no supporting evidence” to back its claim that it lacked jurisdiction over the 2017 pipeline leak, the court said. “The Commission’s statements about having investigated whether the leak was waste are wholly unsupported,” the decision said. The petition for the hearing was submitted in 2019 by Hollis French, a former AOGCC commissioner who argued that the body had failed to fulfill its duties. “The agency seemed eager to shuck its responsibilities and the Supreme Court corrected that,” French said on Friday after the ruling. Cook Inlet, Alaska’s oldest producing oil basin, hit peak production three decades ago, averaging 219,000 barrels per day in 1971, according to the state. Oil production there is now between 11,000 and 12,000 barrels per day, according to the department. The pipeline supplies natural gas that powers operations at two of Hilcorp’s offshore oil platforms. The leak in question was discovered at the end of 2016, but it was not repaired until the spring of 2017. That pipeline has had several leaks over the years. In April, it leaked gas for the fifth time since 2014, prompting Hilcorp to temporarily shut down production at the platforms. After the most recent leak, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) ordered Hilcorp to replace the entire seven-mile pipeline section within a year. PHMSA also ordered Hilcorp to take several shorter-term correction actions in the interim. Grace Salazar, a spokeswoman for the AOGCC, said by email that the agency is reviewing the court decision to determine the next steps."
"Sergeant Bee, immortalized in Afghanistan photo, reflects on war's legacy",8938,"JACKSONVILLE, N.C., Sept 7 (Reuters) - Today, on a leafy cul-de-sac in North Carolina, his hair is streaked with gray, and he wears his beard long. But on that day 13 years ago, as he sat tucked behind a mud wall in Afghanistan, his head was close-cropped, bare and vulnerable. Retired U.S. Marine Sgt. Billy Bee is sharing a smoke with Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic on the deck of Bee's home. The smoke hangs in the humid, still air, just as it did on May 18, 2008, when their lives were stitched together in a single moment of explosive violence and unlikely survival. They are two men united by war, coming together again as the messy and tragic American involvement in Afghanistan finally was coming to an end, 20 years after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., set it all in motion. Both men remember that 2008 day as being blisteringly hot and humid. Tomasevic was in his underwear and boots, fiddling with a new lens, snapping shots of Bee near Garmsir, in Helmand province, as they talked and smoked. When shots came from a nearby hut, just beyond the wall, Tomasevic rushed into a nearby building inside the compound and grabbed some clothes, his protective vest and a helmet. He lay down next to Bee. The sergeant was a slim 26-year-old at the time, carrying an M-16 rifle that seemed almost as large as him from some angles. He wasn't wearing any body armor or a helmet but poked his head above the wall, anyway, looking for targets. Tomasevic, then 38, kept taking pictures. Moments later, a shot hit the top of the wall near Bee's head, exploding the mud and knocking him down and backward. ""And for the first time in my career, I drop the camera,"" Tomasevic says in his clipped English, spoken with a Serbian accent. ""I look at him lying down. I said, 'Bee, Bee,' and I look: Where is the blood? The bleeding? And I look around and there is nothing, man, no bleeding."" Bee was briefly unconscious but apparently fine. Later, going through the images he took, Tomasevic showed Bee the picture he caught the moment the round hit the wall. ""You are going to be famous,"" he told the Marine. And within hours, the picture had appeared on websites and newspapers around the world. For more than a decade, a framed print of the picture hung on the walls of the Reuters newsroom in New York City, an exemplar of the news agency's photojournalism. That shot, taken by a photographer whose own life was forged by war in his native land, is one of the iconic pictures of the conflict in Afghanistan, capturing the eternal fragility of service members at war. Bee loves the picture. It makes him laugh. ""I look at it with fondness. I mean, yeah, the situation was shitty at the time, the environment sucked, the whole experience was godawful. Except for, you know, the firefights and stuff like that. That's, honestly, where I think I was having the most fun of my career,"" Bee says. ""As long as we're not losing guys, I'm having a blast doing that stuff."" As it turned out, Bee wasn't fine after that picture was taken. The concussive effect of the bullet hitting so close to his head knocked him out. The image may have documented the first traumatic injury to the front of his brain, where short-term memory and reasoning are processed. There would be at least one more head injury in June 2010 that resulted in the discovery of brain damage, his medical records show. Nearly a decade after his first deployment as one of the first Marines in Afghanistan, he would never be cleared for combat again. Bee, who left the Marines in April 2013, has a frontal lobe brain injury that affects his short-term memory. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and rage disorder. But that picture thrust him into the public eye, and he and his wife, Bobbie Bee, have used it to advance the cause of care of service members damaged by war. Today, Bee is routinely quoted in news stories published worldwide and is often cited as an example of how the Veterans Administration struggled to adequately care for service members suffering from mental health problems brought on by their service. Back in 2008, on the home front, Bobbie was pregnant with their son Ethan. It was Bee's third deployment in Afghanistan but the first time he had shipped out overseas since they were married in 2006. Until that picture was published, her husband's absence half a planet away in a war-ravaged land didn't seem very different from when he went away for training. Bee never called his wife to let her know about the picture, even though Tomasevic offered to let him use his satellite phone. Shortly after the picture was published, she stumbled onto it while visiting a news site for military families. ""I let out a scream that my parents still remember, because they thought I was going into labor,"" she says. ""When I saw that picture, I am, like, this is real."" It was 78 hours before he called and she was sure her husband was alive. ""When we first talked, it was like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited you're OK. And then I was like, WHERE WAS YOUR GEAR? And he's like, what happened to the sweet wife who is so thankful I'm OK?"" In the years that followed, Bee suffered from depression and flashbacks. Two or three times a week, he woke up feeling adrenaline rushing through his body as if readying himself for a bar fight. During the day, a mild irritant for most people could turn to fury in him. He self-medicated with alcohol, he says. In October 2010, Bobbie Bee says, she came home to find him passed out in the kitchen. Earlier they had fought, and he left her a note, saying goodbye. He wanted to die. ""I tried: two liters of tequila in about two minutes,"" he recalls. ""Her and I had got into a huge fight and I say: 'I'm done. Fuck this. I have had enough.'"" Bobbie Bee says she had struggled with his angry outbursts for months since his return, but now she was scared for his life. She wanted to take him to the hospital but worried about what it would do to his career. He was too heavy for her to move far, so she propped him up against the fridge and taped his head to the door so he couldn't choke on his vomit. ""I used really strong packing tape,"" she says, chuckling with her husband as they recall the episode. ""But at the time, it was horrifying. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have family. They were 500 miles away."" Fortunately, a corpsman friend lived nearby, and he brought over saline IV drips. He inserted them into his fellow Marine's arms, and eventually, Bee regained consciousness. ""And then I wake up with my head duct-taped to the fridge and two mainline IVs in my arm,"" he recalls. With the help of his wife, Bee eventually got treatment and now takes seven prescriptions every day, including several antipsychotic and anti-depression drugs. He has a job working for a company that designs autonomous targeting robots that the Marines use for combat training. He works nights, on Camp Lejeune, the famed Marine base near his home. Sitting on the back porch, Bobbie Bee watches her husband chat with Tomasevic, who's visiting the U.S. from his home in Turkey, and says she saw, in that moment, a bit of the man she met and married rather than the man who came home from war. The two men came together to reflect on the years of warfare in response to the 2001 attacks. ""Billy can tell you everything from June 8th, 2010, and prior, as if it just happened, but if you ask him what he had for dinner yesterday, he wouldn't remember,"" she says. ""The time he spent with Goran and things like that, he remembers. So that's what makes him happy."" And while sitting next to Tomasevic, he laughs and reminisces about the weeks they spent together, sleeping on cardboard, and numerous firefights with the Taliban. Bee's memory of those days is precise and detailed. ""I cannot believe I have come to his house,"" Tomasevic says. ""I feel really good, but I still can't believe I'm here talking to him. We can't stop talking."" Tomasevic spent about three weeks with Bee's unit in 2008. They came together again in 2010 in Marjah, Afghanistan, shortly before the last injury that ended the Marine's combat career. Tomasevic has continued working in conflict zones for Reuters, from the Arab Spring in Egypt to the fighting in Syria, Libya and, of course, Afghanistan. He insists he is more than the work he has done shooting conflict and despair. ""I am a professional. I shoot sports, whatever."" But he acknowledges that he takes special pride in his war work. ""I have an affection for war and conflict because I believe this is the hardest to do in this job."" Thirty years after joining Reuters during the civil war in his native country, then Yugoslavia, he says he can compartmentalize the images, so they don't damage him in the way others might be damaged. ""I grew up in a war zone. And I have been doing this for 30 years."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Indonesia records its lowest rate of positive coronavirus tests,2164,"JAKARTA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia's daily coronavirus positivity rate dropped below the World Health Organization's (WHO) benchmark standard of 5% this week for the first time, an indicator the country's devastating second wave could be easing. The positivity rate, or the proportion of people tested who are positive, peaked at 33.4% in July when Indonesia became Asia's coronavirus epicentre, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. On Monday that rate fell to 4.57%, the lowest since March 2020, when Indonesia's first cases were reported, according to independent data initiative, Kawal COVID-19.

"Reopen schools or disaster looms, experts tell Indian authorities",3401,"NEW DELHI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Many top Indian epidemiolgists and social scientists are urging authorities to reopen in-person school classes for all age groups, saying the benefits outweigh the risks especially as poor rural children are missing out on online education. The recommendation comes as experts say another COVID-19 wave in India this year could be far less deadly, because a dramatic rise in cases in April and May means a big majority of the population have been infected already, while more than half of its adults have been at least partly vaccinated. India last month approved its first COVID-19 shot for people under 18, though as of now only adults are being immunised. As new infections have stabilised around 40,000 a day in the past few weeks, some Indian states have restarted face-to-face teaching, mainly for middle school and above. Experts say that is not enough. ""Schools are an essential service. It has been wisely said that they should be the last to close and the first to reopen,"" said a report released on Monday on school education by a group of scholars, including economist and social scientist Jean Dreze, that warned of a ""looming disaster"". ""In India, the opposite has been happening: soon after the COVID-19 crisis struck in early 2020, all schools were closed without batting an eyelid and most of them are still closed today."" The health and education ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The federal government has largely left it to states to decide when to reopen schools. NO EDUCATION An August survey of nearly 1,400 school children done by the scholars' group found that in rural areas, only 8% were studying online regularly, 37% were not studying at all, and about half were unable to read more than a few words. Most parents wanted schools to reopen as soon as possible, it said. The reasons were that many children did not have their own smartphone, mobile connectivity was poor, they did not have the money to pay for mobile Internet, schools were not sending study material or online education was too hard to grasp for some. The Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, whose roughly 6,000 members are doctors who have studied epidemiology, told the government in a report it was safe to resume all offline classes after taking precautions such as improved ventilation, physical distancing and masking. Epidemiologists also say that as India's last serological survey estimated that more than half of the country's population of 6-17 years had already been infected, without any particular severity, there was no reason to worry that a future wave will specifically target the unvaccinated ones among them. ""The risk of moderate to severe disease in children is really low and vaccination is not a prerequisite,"" said epidemiologist and public health expert Chandrakant Lahariya. ""Therefore, I believe that the technical experts should not rush to recommend vaccination of adolescents in India. The focus has to continue to be on achieving high coverage for all adult age groups,"" he said in an email. India has administered 701.9 million vaccine doses - at least one dose in 57% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 17%. India reported 31,222 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total to 33.1 million. Daily deaths rose by 290 to 441,042. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that millions of Afghans were in need of food aid and health assistance, urging donors to give more ahead of an international aid conference for Afghanistan on Sept. 13. The agency has released a flash appeal for around $600 million to meet humanitarian needs for 11 million people for the remainder of the year amid warnings of drought and starvation. ""Basic services in Afghanistan are collapsing and food and other lifesaving aid is about to run out,"" he said. ""We urge international donors to support this appeal fast and generously.""

"Nigeria's Delta region oil hub may need new COVID lockdown, governor says",1775,"YENAGOA, Nigeria, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The governor of Rivers State in Nigeria's oil-producing Delta region said he may be forced to reimpose COVID-19 lockdown measures if residents did not comply with prevention protocols amid a rise in cases. Governor Nyesom Wike implored residents to get vaccinated and comply with safety and social distancing rules amid a consistent rise in COVID-19 infections over the past two weeks. ""We may be constrained to re-impose the suspended COVID-19 lockdown measures across the state if the transmission of the disease continues to increase beyond tolerable limits,"" Wike said in an address on Monday. Wike shared a copy of the speech with Reuters on Tuesday. Rivers state capital Port Harcourt is the gateway to the Delta region. Movement restrictions last year impinged on oil companies' ability to move workers around the region and forced some to delay or curtail maintenance. The state's 10,809 confirmed COVID-19 cases make it the third worst-hit state in Africa's most populous country, after Lagos and the federal capital territory of Abuja. On August 26, the state recorded 263 cases - the highest daily count since March 2020. The state has also recorded a total of 137 deaths. Wike also appealed to religious leaders and churches to encourage their members to get vaccinated and comply with the COVID-19 protocols. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, is battling a third wave of COVID-19 infections. The country began its vaccination campaign in March with nearly 4 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca shots provided via the COVAX scheme, and has since received millions more doses of AstraZeneca and Moderna shots. However it has also struggled with vaccine hesitancy. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Week ahead in Insurance: Sept. 7, 2021",3252,"(Reuters) - Here are some events of interest to the Insurance Law community this week. All times are local unless otherwise noted. Thursday, Sept. 9 10 a.m. – In arguments to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Allstate Insurance will defend a ruling by a federal judge in Brooklyn that allows it to seize and sell the home Mark Mirvis and his spouse transferred to their daughter in 2015, days after he was found jointly liable under RICO for using New York’s no-fault auto insurance laws to defraud health insurers of $46 million. U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen last year voided the 2015 transfer, restoring the property to Mark and Lyubov Mirvis as a tenancy-by-the-entirety with right of survivorship; then, she found that Lyubov Mirvis had acted in bad faith, and extinguished her right of survivorship. Lyubov Mirvis argues that the lower court erred in its findings and that, in any event, the court could not extinguish a spouse’s right of survivorship under New York law. Chen noted that New York’s highest court had not weighed in that question and that lower state and federal courts had gone both ways.

G7 nations urge return to constitutional order in Tunisia,2045,"TUNIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The ambassadors of the G7 group of advanced economies urged Tunisia's president on Monday to appoint a new head of government as a matter of urgency and return to a constitutional order in which an elected parliament plays a significant role. The statement, put out by the British Embassy on social media, is the most significant public expression of unease by major democracies since President Kais Saied seized governing powers in July in moves his opponents called a coup. ""We underline the urgent need to appoint a new head of government to form a capable government able to address the immediate economic and health crises facing Tunisia,"" the statement said. Saied did not directly comment on the G7 statement. But in remarks later on Monday to the National Guard, he said: ""Tunisia is a sovereign country and sovereignty belongs to the people"". Western democracies have been among the most important donors helping to support Tunisian public finances over the past decade as the economy has slumped since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy. Saied, who was elected in 2019, said on July 25 he was freezing parliament, lifting the immunity of its members, dismissing the prime minister and that he would assume executive authority alongside a new premier. He said his intervention was in line with the constitution and necessitated by a national emergency due to political paralysis, high COVID-19 rates, and protests. He has vowed that rights will not be affected. Six weeks on, however, he has not named a prime minister or said what he plans to do, has indefinitely rolled over the emergency measures and said there can be ""no going back"", while Tunisians speculate about whether he will amend the constitution. The G7 statement said appointing a prime minister would ""create space for an inclusive dialogue about proposed constitutional and electoral reforms"" and added that democratic values would remain central to their relations with Tunisia.

"Mixing CanSinoBIO, Sinovac COVID shots induces stronger response than Sinovac alone -study",1808,"BEIJING, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A Chinese study looking at mixing COVID-19 vaccines showed that receiving a booster shot of CanSino Biologics' vaccine after one or two doses of Sinovac Biotech's (SVA.O) vaccine yielded a much stronger antibody response than using the Sinovac shot as a booster. The study, among the first analyses in China combing different COVID-19 vaccines, comes as the country said it would use booster shots in specific groups amid concerns over vaccines' waning protection over time. Participants who received a CanSinoBIO (6185.HK), booster dose three to six months after a second Sinovac shot showed a 78-fold jump on average in neutralizing antibody levels two weeks later, according to a paper published on Monday before a peer review. By contrast, those who received a Sinovac booster shot showed a 15.2-fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, researchers from local disease control authorities, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutions said in the paper. One dose of Sinovac followed by a CanSinoBIO booster at intervals of one or two months led to a 25.7-fold increase in neutralising antibody levels, while two doses of Sinovac induced a 6.2-fold increase. The study analysed data from about 300 healthy adults aged 18-59. The study did not assess the boosters' protection against COVID-19 and did not test the neutralising antibody against the more transmissible Delta variant, the paper said. More than 1.4 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been administered globally, about three quarters of them in China. China, which has kept local infections under control, has fully vaccinated around 69% of its population as of Sept. 6. It said on Tuesday a total of 2.1 billion doses had been administered as of Monday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

India 'prepares for the worst' ahead of possible COVID-19 third wave,4690,"NEW DELHI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - As COVID-19 cases and deaths exploded in India in April and May, New Delhi's premier Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and several others ran so short of oxygen that many patients in the capital suffocated. When Reuters visited the hospital on Friday, its last coronavirus patient was readying to leave after recovery - a remarkable turnaround health experts attribute to growing levels of immunity from natural infection and vaccinations. But hospitals have learned from bitter experience during the second COVID wave, when funeral pyres burned non-stop and bodies littered the banks of the holy Ganges river, as India braces for another possible surge in infections around its September-November festival season. Beds have been added at facilities around the country, and hospitals are working to ensure ample supplies of oxygen. Ganga Ram is raising its oxygen storage capacity by 50%, has laid a one-kilometre-long pipeline carrying the gas directly to COVID ICUs, and is installing equipment to keep the oxygen flow high. It has also ordered an onsite oxygen-generation plant, which are mostly made in Europe and can take months to arrive given the surge in demand globally. ""In light of the possibility of the emergence of coronavirus mutants, with higher transmissibility and immune escape, the hospital continues to prepare for the worst,"" said Satendra Katoch, medical director of the hospital, in between guiding colleagues doing an internal audit of its facilities. The crowded private hospital, however, said it had no scope to add more beds. During the peak of India's second wave, Ganga Ram expanded its capacity by nearly 50% to about 600 beds, but even so, some 500 patients per day had to be put on a waitlist for admission, according to physician Varun Prakash, who managed its war-room during the crisis. Nationally, India has added many more hospital beds in the past few months and imported more than 100 oxygen carriers to raise the total to about 1,250. Companies such as Linde (LIND.NS)(LIN.N) are planning to lift the country's overall output of the gas by 50% to 15,000 tonnes a day. Linde told Reuters it had retained 60 of some 80 cryogenic containers - meant to hold super-cooled oxygen - it had brought in from the company's overseas operations, in case demand shot up again. ""The distribution infrastructure and logistics fell short during the second wave,"" Linde South Asia head, Moloy Banerjee, said. The federal government, meanwhile, has approved the construction of nearly 1,600 oxygen-generation plants at hospitals, though fewer than 300 had been set up as of early last month as imports take time. HIGH ANTIBODY LEVELS Almost all states are readying special paediatric wards as some experts warn unvaccinated children could be vulnerable to any new virus mutations. States including Madhya Pradesh are also stocking up on anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir. But with a government survey estimating as many as two-thirds of Indians already have COVID-fighting antibodies through natural infection, and 57% of its adults with at least an initial vaccine dose, many health experts believe any new outbreak of infections could be much less devastating than the second wave. ""The number of susceptible persons will be less now, as many persons have been infected or vaccinated,"" said epidemiologist and cardiologist K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""Even if reinfections or breakthrough infections occur, they are likely to be mild and mostly managed at home. The serious gaps in health-service delivery that were evident in the second wave are less likely to be seen."" Kerala is seeing such signs already. The southern state currently has the highest number of infections, including many among vaccinated or partly vaccinated residents, but its fatality rate is well below the national figure. At 33.1 million, India has reported the most number of COVID-19 cases after the United States, with 441,042 deaths. It has administered 698.4 million vaccine doses - at least one dose in 57% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 17%. The health ministry, which wants to immunise India's entire adult population this year, did not respond to a request for comment on its preparations for a potential third wave. Epidemiologist and public health specialist Chandrakant Lahariya said the data and trends were encouraging. ""With the emerging evidence that for individuals with past infection, single dose may provide far greater levels of antibodies than people who did not have infection or receive both shots of vaccines, it is assuring for India.""

Indian court backs shorter dose gap for those paying for AstraZeneca vaccine,1961,"KOCHI, India, Sept 7 (Reuters) - An Indian court has ordered the government to offer a choice of a shorter four-week gap between doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine to those paying for the shots, down from 12 to 16 weeks now. India doubled the gap between doses of the locally-produced Covishield vaccine in May, to help stretch scarce supplies, so as to give at least one dose to 57% of its 944 million adults. But just 17% have been fully immunised. In an order posted on its website on Monday, the high court in the southern state of Kerala ordered changes in the health ministry's vaccine-booking platform to permit the choice, in line with that offered to those flying abroad. ""There is absolutely no reason why the same privilege shall not be extended to others who want early protection in connection with their employment, education, etc,"" the court said. In its remarks, the court drew a parallel with the government's permission for those planning overseas travel to choose between early and better protection from COVID-19 infections. The decision followed a plea by two garment companies with a total of more than 10,000 employees. The court asked the government to enable scheduling of the second dose within four weeks of the first for those who want it, in line with the gap specified in initial vaccine protocols. The health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The ministry has said its decision for a wider gap between doses was based on scientific evidence that the step boosted protection. India's immunisation campaign began in mid-January, with a four-week interval between two Covishield doses. India has injected 698.4 million doses of vaccine. About a quarter of the supplies are sold, with the rest provided free. India's tally of infections stands at 33.1 million, boosted by 31,222 new cases in the past 24 hours, with daily deaths up 290 for a total of 441,042.

FIFA chief says Brazil game abandonment was 'crazy',3563,"MANCHESTER, England, Sept 6 (Reuters) - FIFA is investigating the abandonment of the Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier with its president Gianni Infantino labelling the events ""crazy"", while Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly ready to take disciplinary action against their Argentine players. read more Brazilian health authorities intervened on Sunday after accusing four Argentine Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Spurs duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of Argentina's team when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa walked onto the field and stopped the game around five minutes after kickoff. read more Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia had also travelled from the UK and was in the stands. Anvisa said Brazilian rules make clear that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. It said Argentine players had made false statements about their previous whereabouts on immigration forms. Brazil's Federal Police said on Monday they had opened a formal inquiry into the actions of the Argentine players who, a spokesperson said, were deported. ""We can confirm an investigation has begun into the possible crime of supplying false information,"" a spokesperson said. ""Yesterday, the players were notified they must leave the country, which is the regular procedure, and statements from them were taken."" The Argentina squad left Brazil together on Sunday night and flew back to Buenos Aires. FIFA said it had received reports from match officials. ""The information will be analysed by the competent disciplinary bodies and a decision will be taken in due course,"" world soccer's governing body said in a statement. The Argentine Football Association said FIFA gave both national associations six days to outline their positions. DIFFICULT SITUATION Infantino, in a video address to the European Club Association's general assembly, said the situation was a reminder of the difficulties faced during the pandemic. ""We saw what happened with the game between Brazil and Argentina, two of South America's most glorious teams,"" Infantino said. ""Some officials, police, security officials entered the pitch after a few minutes of the game to take away some players - it is crazy but we need to deal with these challenges, these issues which come on top of the COVID crisis."" Alejandro Martinez, brother of Emiliano, said the players were due to fly from Argentina to Croatia, which is a UK green-list country, later on Monday to avoid the 10-day mandatory hotel quarantine on return to the UK from a red-list country. ""They will travel to Croatia to do their quarantine there and then go to England,"" Alejandro told radio station La Oral Deportiva. ""That was the condition set by Aston Villa."" The Argentine Football Association (AFA) said Martinez and Buendia had been released from the national team, meaning they will not take part in Thursday's qualifier at home to Bolivia. The AFA later released Spurs pair Lo Celso and Romero, saying, “they are out of the game against Bolivia and can return to their club”. The website football.london said the Spurs pair could expect club fines on their return to England having made the trip without the permission of their club. Villa and Tottenham declined to comment.

"Taliban claim control of Panjshir, opposition says resistance will continue",5536,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban claimed victory on Monday in the last part of Afghanistan still holding out against their rule, declaring that the capture of the Panjshir valley completed their takeover of the country and they would unveil a new government soon. Pictures on social media showed Taliban members standing in front of the gate of the Panjshir provincial governor's compound after days of fighting with the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), commanded by Panjshiri leader Ahmad Massoud. ""Panjshir, which was the last hideout of the escapee enemy, is captured,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference. Massoud did not concede defeat, saying his force, drawn from the remnants of the regular Afghan army as well as local militia fighters, was still fighting.

Japan to purchase 150 mln doses of Takeda-produced Novavax vaccines - drugmaker,1987,"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T) said on Tuesday the Japanese government agreed to purchase 150 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it will produce using Novavax Inc's (NVAX.O) formula. Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker, is preparing to make the vaccine domestically and will distribute it in early 2022, pending approval from regulators, the company said in a statement. The TAK-019 vaccine is still undergoing clinical trials in Japan, according to Takeda. The terms of the deal with the government are confidential, Takeda said. Novavax is licensing and transferring manufacturing technologies to enable Takeda to manufacture the vaccine, according to the statement. The announcement builds on an earlier agreement between Takeda and the government to make some 250 million doses of the Novavax shot. The remaining doses could be given to other countries, Takeda has said previously. read more Japan has donated most of its domestically produced supplies of AstraZeneca Plc's vaccine, relying primarily on imported doses of the mRNA-type shots developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) for its national inoculation push. After a slow start, Japan's vaccination drive has made some progress in recent months, with 58% of the population now having received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker. Takeda is also handling the import and distribution of some 50 million doses of Moderna's vaccine this year and 50 million more next year. Three batches of Moderna supplies, or about 1.6 million doses, were recalled in Japan after the discovery of small metal contaminants in some vials. read more The health ministry said on Monday that a third person had died after getting a shot from the recalled Moderna supplies. Takeda said in a separate statement on Tuesday that the causes of death are being investigated, and there is no evidence they are linked to the vaccine. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. Justice Dept. says will protect Texas abortion clinics that come under attack,1926,"WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday said it would not tolerate attacks against people seeking or providing abortions in Texas, as the agency explores ways of challenging the state's recently enacted law that imposed a near-total ban on abortion. The law, known as SB8, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the department would “protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” through a 1994 law known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act). The FACE Act prohibits the use of force and physical obstruction to interfere with a person obtaining or providing reproductive health services. Former President Bill Clinton backed the legislation in response to violence by anti-abortion activists in the 1980s and 90s. ""The department will provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack,"" Garland said, adding that he would ""not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services."" Garland said the Justice Department would enforce the FACE Act while it ""urgently explores all options to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons."" Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices arecloser than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected.

"France mourns 'national treasure' Belmondo, New Wave cinema star",2992,"PARIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Jean-Paul Belmondo, a star of France's New Wave cinema after his breakthrough performance in Jean-Luc Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" (""Breathless"") in 1959, has died. He was 88. The death of a leading figure in French cinema was felt across the country. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that France had lost a ""national treasure"". ""It seems to me that all of France is sad,"" Michel Godest, Belmondo's friend and lawyer, told BFM TV, breaking down in tears. A charismatic actor who often performed his own stunts, Belmondo switched in the 1960s to mainstream films and became one of France's leading comedy and action heroes. His decision to pursue a career in commercial cinema and to shun the art houses led to criticism that he had wasted his undisputed talent - something he always denied. ""When an actor is successful, people turn their back on him and say that he has taken the easy way out, that he doesn't want to make an effort or take any risks,"" Belmondo once said. ""But if it was so easy to fill cinemas, then the film world would be in much better health than it is. I don't think I would have stayed in the limelight for so long if I was doing any old rubbish. People aren't that stupid."" Godest told AFP that Belmondo passed away at home, adding: ""He had been very tired for some time. He died peacefully."" 'HOOLIGAN'S FACE' Belmondo was born on April 9, 1933, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the son of the renowned sculptor Paul Belmondo and painter Sarah Rainaud-Richard. Despite his cultured background, he appeared more drawn to the world of sport than the arts and was a keen boxer in his youth. Once he had discovered acting, it took three attempts before the Paris Conservatory agreed in 1952 to take him on as a student. Even then it was not a smooth passage, and Belmondo quit in a huff in 1956 after receiving a cool reception for one of his performances from a conservatory jury. One of his teachers predicted at the time: ""Mr. Belmondo will never succeed with his hooligan's face."" Belmondo's reply was an obscene gesture. He went on to star in more than 80 movies, many of them blockbusters, over the next half a century. Belmondo first gained acclaim in ""Sois belle et tais-toi"" (""Look pretty and shut up"") in 1958 and in ""A double tour"" by Claude Chabrol in 1959, where his magnetism stole the film. But his role as a small-time hood who romanced American ingenue Jean Seberg in Godard's ""Breathless"" earned him international stardom. Belmondo's appeal, a mixture of cynicism and sensitivity, warmth and unselfconscious ease, created a new kind of romanticism that brought him roles in the films of France's New Wave directors Francois Truffaut, Alain Resnais and Louis Malle. ""If I have advice to give young actors, it is to never neglect technique: without technique, you limit invention. But it should never show. What counts is the result, not the sweat and the pain it cost,"" he once said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"G20 urges COVID help for poor states, but short on new commitments",2631,"ROME, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The group of 20 rich countries said on Monday more efforts were needed to help poor countries vaccinate their populations against COVID-19, but steered clear of making new numerical or financial commitments. Italy, which holds the G20 presidency this year, said after the gathering that the ""Pact of Rome,"" where the meeting was held on Sunday and Monday, included a political agreement to increase support for poor nations and send them more vaccines. ""The level of (vaccine) inequality is too high and is not sustainable,"" Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza told reporters. ""If we leave part of the world without vaccines we risk new variants which will hurt all of us...Our message is very clear: no one must be left behind in the vaccination campaign."" Vaccines are being shipped to poor countries through the international COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). However, richer nations have come under fire for allegedly stockpiling COVID-19 jabs as many underdeveloped countries with low inoculation rates and rising infections struggle to get supplies. read more ""The strongest countries...are committed to investing significant resources and sending vaccines to the most fragile...We should strengthen this system bilaterally and through international platforms starting from COVAX,"" Speranza said. However, asked whether the G20 had made any new concrete financial commitments, he warned such pledges risked being a ""straitjacket,"" and the important thing was a ""political goal"" of global vaccination. ""We want to take the vaccine to the whole world and we'll make the investments necessary. Will they be enough? Will more be needed? The countries of the world are making a commitment in this direction,"" he said. A 11-page declaration released after the meeting made no new financial pledges, but Speranza said these may be delivered at a joint meeting of G20 health and finance ministers in October. That will be ""a decisive occasion to find the resources to finance the instruments we have put on the table"", he said. A little over 230 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to 139 countries under COVAX, GAVI data shows, against a target to secure 2 billion doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021. Speranza stressed that poor countries must also be helped to produce vaccines at home. ""Transferring doses is not enough. We have to make other areas of the world capable of producing, sharing methodologies and procedures,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
BGI prenatal gene test under scrutiny for Chinese military links,9251,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Health regulators in five countries are examining a prenatal test that collects the DNA of women and fetuses for research, while some doctors that promoted it and clinics that sell it say they were unaware the company that produces it also conducts research with the Chinese military. The test, made by Shenzhen-based BGI Group and marketed under the brand name NIFTY, is sold in at least 52 countries. It screens for Down syndrome and more than 80 other genetic conditions, and has been taken by 8.4 million women globally. The regulators' concerns, raised in response to a Reuters report, highlight the challenges of regulatory oversight when genetic data is sent from one country to another. Canada's privacy commissioner said the report raised important questions about ""highly sensitive"" information and it is looking into the matter. Two regulators in Europe - in Slovenia and in Germany - said they were examining the test in light of European Union data protection rules. The data privacy regulator in Slovenia, where one of BGI's regional partners is based, said it was concerned by the exporting of data from the BGI tests and would examine data protection issues. But it added that Slovenia has not yet adopted the changes to its national laws to make Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fully applicable, so it cannot issue fines in the event of GDPR breaches. Reuters reported in July that more than a dozen scientific studies - including clinical trials - showed BGI developed and improved the test in collaboration with People's Liberation Army hospitals. BGI uses the pregnant women's genetic data for research into the traits of populations. It also collaborates with the PLA in other areas of research. BGI rejects any suggestion that it developed the NIFTY test in collaboration with the military, and says working with military hospitals is not equivalent. It said it works with thousands of healthcare providers, that other prenatal test providers in China work with military hospitals, and that many companies worldwide work with militaries. It said it takes data privacy seriously, complies with applicable laws and regulations, and only 5% of its NIFTY tests have been conducted on women overseas. Consent forms signed by women outside China seek permission for their blood samples and genetic data to be sent abroad to BGI and used for research. The privacy policy on the test’s website also says data can be shared for national security purposes in China - though BGI says it has never been asked to do so. Regulators in Germany, Australia, Estonia and Canada called for transparency in BGI's use of women's genetic data, and said even if data was sent abroad, BGI's local vendors are responsible for ensuring data privacy. The European Data Protection Supervisor said it was monitoring the situation. ""It is vital that the patient is provided with clear information,"" said Beverley Rowbotham, chairperson of Australia's National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. A regulator in Ontario told Reuters it is now advising women to seek tests from providers in Canada, or places where data security is ""comparable"" to the protections mandated in Canada. The regulator in Quebec said prenatal tests - like consumer genetic tests - can result in people losing control over their genetic information. Canadian privacy and genetic disclosure laws can impose maximum fines of C$250,000 to C$1 million for breaches, and set strict conditions for exemptions for scientific research. ""Genetic information is not only valuable to marketers and data brokers, but also to foreign states and cybercriminals as well,"" the Office of the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario told Reuters. Fertility Partners, a clinic network in Canada, said it had no prior knowledge of BGI's work with the PLA, and had stopped selling NIFTY through its clinics in April for unrelated reasons. Reuters has previously reported that BGI's joint research with PLA medical institutes is wide ranging, from efforts to protect soldiers from altitude sickness to mass testing for pathogens. U.S. government advisers warned in March that a vast bank of genomic data that BGI is amassing and analyzing with artificial intelligence could give China a path to economic and military advantage. read more The same military hospital that ran clinical trials for NIFTY also collaborated with BGI to send pathogens into space under a military equipment research program, according to 12 scientific papers, which has not previously been reported. BGI did not respond to a request for more information about that research program. In the United Kingdom, where NIFTY tests are only sold through private clinics, the government said BGI would need to register its test before Sept. 1 to continue selling them. BGI told Reuters it submitted a voluntary registration to the UK medical regulator in August. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Reuters it had received BGI’s registration but said the application had not yet had data validation and scrutiny by the regulator's registration and software team. read more NIFTY tests are sold overseas through three business models: local clinics collect blood samples to send to BGI in Hong Kong; labs sequence the DNA from blood samples locally and share the data with BGI in Hong Kong where it is stored for five years; or labs complete the entire process locally using BGI technology. Labs in Spain and Slovenia each told Reuters the genetic data of a client had been used by BGI in mainland China for research, with informed consent. Slovenia-based GenePlanet, which says it sells NIFTY tests across Europe and also offers its own-branded test using BGI's technology, said the Slovenia customer gave consent for a ""research test."" GenePlanet says it operates according to EU regulations and has an agreement with BGI that ""none of the GenePlanet patient data generated from (the) NIFTY process is going to mainland China."" The Slovenian and Spanish women's data was among that of 542 women stored in China's National GeneBank, which BGI also runs. BGI said the data of the 542 women has not been used for other purposes, and its ""scientific research only uses anonymised data."" Eluthia GmbH, a laboratory in Germany which sells BGI's test, said its transfer of women's blood and patient data to BGI had been suspended by the data protection regulator for the Hesse region while it investigates whether the rules had been violated read more . Eluthia said it did not know when it could resume sending tests to BGI. Its Chief Executive Ramon Enriquez Schaefer said doctors had called the suspension ""excessive"" since patients had ""expressly consented to the shipment to Hong Kong."" He also said Eluthia hasn't been able to make ""concrete progress"" on the regulator's concerns about BGI's military collaboration. BGI told Reuters it is providing information to Eluthia and relevant government authorities to demonstrate it complies with data protection laws. DOCTORS' VIEWS One UK doctor who promoted BGI's test in an online video when it first became available said he would now advise women not to take the BGI test, due to privacy concerns. ""My personal view now would be to advise anybody not to use the BGI NIFTY test - not from a clinical point of view - but because the data from it might be misappropriated or used for reasons that neither the clinician nor the patient would ever have imagined,"" said Bryan Beattie, a fetal medicine consultant. Reuters contacted Beattie and two other UK doctors who also promoted the test on BGI's YouTube channels in 2014 for their reactions. The doctors said they were unaware of BGI's military links. BGI said the doctors were not paid to participate and it had told them the videos were for educational and marketing purposes. The NIFTY test captures more genetic information about the mother and the fetus than the results patients see, said Beattie, which has previously been reported by Reuters and BGI has confirmed. ""If you were able to link that to large numbers of patients in a foreign country, you would have a fairly good idea of their health profile over the next sort of 20 or 30 years,"" said Beattie. Beattie said he had supported the relatively new technology because it was an improvement on previous methods, but his clinic had switched to a different supplier for reasons unrelated to privacy. An Estonian scientist who turned down an offer from BGI in 2020 to replace a test developed by his lab with NIFTY said he was concerned European health services, whom he declined to name, were choosing BGI's test because of its cheaper cost and not considering data security. ""It is a stupidly easy way to earn money for taking a blood sample,"" said Kaarel Krjutskov, who runs the Estonian lab.

Chilean health regulator approves CoronaVac use among children over age 6,1409,"SANTIAGO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Chilean health regulator on Monday approved the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O) for use in children over 6 years of age, allowing more people to be included in the country's rapid inoculation campaign. The South American country has already approved the use of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) vaccine for children over 12, with 654,053 receiving at least one dose since May. Sinovac's CoronaVac has formed the backbone, however, of Chile's vaccination campaign, which has seen more than 13 million of the country's 19 million inhabitants fully inoculated so far and 19.49 million CoronaVac doses issued in total. ""This is great news for school-age children and those that were not included in previous vaccination plans,"" said Health Minister Enrique Paris. Five of the experts on the evaluation panel convened by the Institute of Public Health (ISP) voted in favor of applying the shot to children over 6, while two voted in favor of issuing it only to those over 12, and one voted against issuing it to children. CoronaVac also has emergency approval for use in children in Indonesia and China. Chile has seen in recent weeks a noticeable drop in infections, recording just 435 new cases on Monday. It has had a total of 1.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 37,108 deaths. ​ Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK announces extra 5.4 bln pounds to help COVID-hit health services,2230,"LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Britain will set aside a further 5.4 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) over the next six months to help its National Health Service cover additional costs from the COVID-19 pandemic and to tackle the huge treatment backlog. Record-breaking waiting lists for routine hospital treatment and an unprecedented summer demand for emergency services are heaping pressure on the health service in England. ""The NHS was there for us during the pandemic - but treating COVID patients has created huge backlogs,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. ""This funding will go straight to the frontline, to provide more patients with the treatments they need but aren’t getting quickly enough."" The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, warned last week that the health service will need about 10 billion pounds more a year to reduce the COVID-19 backlog and cover additional costs from the pandemic. The extra funding announced by the government includes 1 billion pounds to help tackle the backlog and 2.8 billion pounds to cover related costs such as enhanced infection control measures to keep staff and patients safe from the virus. The total number of people who have been referred for hospital care rose in June to 5.45 million, the highest monthly figure since records began, NHS England figures show. Britain's health secretary Sajid Javid last month said that an estimated 7 million people who might have needed to use the health service during the pandemic did not access it – and the waiting list will climb further as more of them seek care. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases have started to climb again over the past month, raising the possibility there could soon be an increase in hospital admissions. The ambulance service handled more than 1 million 999 calls in July, the highest monthly figure on record. More than 2,200 accident and emergency patients waited more than 12 hours on trolleys to be admitted to a ward, the figures showed. The government said the extra funding would take total COVID-19 support for the health service to more than 34 billion pounds this year alone.

Hundreds of health centres at risk of closure in Afghanistan - WHO,1675,"GENEVA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Hundreds of medical facilities in Afghanistan are at risk of imminent closure because the Western donors who finance them are barred from dealing with the new Taliban government, a World Health Organization official said on Monday. Around 90% of 2,300 health facilities across the country might have to close as soon as this week, the UN health agency's regional emergency director, Rick Brennan, told Reuters in an interview. He said may Western donors had regulations which prevented them from dealing with the Taliban, without going into further detail. ""We are going to have a pause in operations in a large proportion of those (health facilities). By some estimates up to 90% will cease functioning probably later in the week and that will be associated with increased illness and death,"" Brennan said. The WHO was trying fill the gap by providing supplies, equipment and financing to 500 of the health centres, he said. The agency was also liaising with Qatar for medical deliveries to come by plane, he added. read more ""We are hoping to have up to two or three plane-loads of supplies airlifted from the government of Qatar probably into Kabul in the next week or so,"" he said. The next deliveries would include COVID tests and supplies to treat chronic diseases. Along with other aid agencies, the WHO has struggled to bring in medical supplies including trauma kits partly because of chaos at Kabul airport. read more Medical supplies continue to be flown in via the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and the WHO is also exploring overland options via trucks from Pakistan, Brennan said.

8th Circ finds no evidence of Medicaid fraud by Planned Parenthood,3627,"(Reuters) - A former clinic director failed to offer evidence that Planned Parenthood of the Heartland intentionally miscoded abortion-related services to get Medicaid to pay for them between 2006 and 2008, a federal appeals court held. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a win Friday for the Iowa-based nonprofit, represented by Dentons, on the remnants of a False Claims Act lawsuit that the Alliance Defending Freedom and Hixson & Brown had filed in 2011 on behalf of Susan Thayer. On the miscoding claim, Thayer accused Planned Parenthood of the Heartland (PPH) of coding post-abortion followup visits as generic post-surgical consultations, then adding the code to bills for contraceptive counseling or other services that Medicaid does cover. The consultation did not increase the charges on two of the six sample bills Thayer submitted as evidence of PPH's practice, but had resulted in a one-level upgrade, good for an extra $12, on each of the other four. “We assume without deciding that she is right, and that Planned Parenthood falsely billed (Medicaid) for these services,” Circuit Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote. However, that alone would not support Thayer’s claim that the falsehood was intentional, he said. Like the lower court, “we think a one-level difference in billing, resulting in less than a $12.00 reimbursement difference, is at most evidence of an innocent mistake or negligence, not a willful lie to cheat the government,” Kobes wrote. He was joined by Circuit Judges Steven Colloton and Roger Wollman. PPH’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. PPH merged with several other Planned Parenthood organizations in 2018 to create Planned Parenthood North Central States. Thayer’s attorneys did not respond directly, but the Alliance Defending Freedom emailed a statement saying that ADF and its client are considering their options. According to Thayer’s 2011 complaint in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, she had worked for PPH between 1991 and 2008 and had managed two of its centers. Thayer alleged that the organization overbilled Medicaid in many different ways between 2002 and 2008, resulting in an estimated $28 million in extra charges. U.S. District Judge John Jarvey granted PPH’s motion to dismiss the case in 2013, finding that Thayer had not plausibly alleged fraud. Thayer appealed, and the 8th Circuit revived some of her claims in 2014. Jarvey further narrowed the suit on remand. By 2019, just two counts remained on Thayer’s Third Amended Complaint: the abortion-related coding claims, and an allegation that PPH had distributed oral contraceptives to women without a prescription. Both sides moved for summary judgment. On the upcoding claim, Jarvey found that Thayer’s evidence would support, at most, an inference of non-actionable coding or billing errors. The 8th Circuit agreed on Friday. On the contraceptive claims, Jarvey ruled for PPH after finding that Thayer had insufficiently pleaded her case. She sought judgment on the basis that PPH had billed Medicaid for extra cycles of pills it dispensed to clients whose prescriptions had expired, but her complaint was focused on bills for contraceptives dispensed before the client ever obtained a prescription, he said. The 8th Circuit affirmed that ruling as well on Friday. The case is Susan Thayer v. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-2151.

Vietnam's capital ramps up testing after extending COVID-19 curbs,2337,"HANOI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, extended COVID-19 restrictions on Monday for a further two weeks, as authorities launched a plan to conduct tests on the city's 8 million people to try to curb a climb in infections that started in late April. The Southeast Asian country dealt successfully with the virus for much of the pandemic, but the virulent Delta variant has proved more challenging in recent months. COVID-19 has infected more than 536,000 people in Vietnam and killed 13,385, the vast majority in the past few months. Hanoi, which has ordered people to stay home and halted all non-essential activities since July, has divided the city into ""red"", ""orange"" and ""green"" zones based on infection risk. ""People in quarantine camps, isolated areas or in red areas will be tested three times per week,"" city authorities said in a statement late on Monday, adding that people in other zones would be tested every five to seven days by either a PCR or rapid antigen test. Barricades on Monday separated red zones from other areas, photographs posted on social media and media outlets showed. Hanoi has been reporting 50 cases daily on average and has recorded over 4,100 cases since the pandemic began, official data showed. Hanoi authoritiesare eager to keep the outbreak from reaching the intensity seen in Ho Chi Minh City, which accounts for nearly half of the total infections and 80% of fatalities. In the southern business hub,where a strict lockdown is in place until Sept. 15, people have been encouraged to test themselves using antigen COVID-19 kits after health services were overwhelmed. In a rare live broadcast of questions from the public to an official late on Monday, Phan Van Mai, chairman of Ho Chi Minh City, said some restaurants in safe zones would be allowed to reopen for takeaway and that city authorities would look to gradually reopen the economy. One-third of Hanoi's residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine and the Health Ministry on Sunday called on the capital and Ho Chi Minh City to vaccinate all adult residents with at least one dose by Sept. 15. read more Vietnam has one of the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates in the region, with only 3.4% of its 98 million people fully vaccinated, and 19% with one shot.

Argentina's Martinez still nonplussed over abandoned World Cup qualifier,3254,"BUENOS AIRES, Sept 6 (Reuters) - One of the players at the centre of Sunday's cancelled Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier has recalled the farcical scenes in Sao Paulo and what he said was despair at the thought of being obliged to stay in Brazil for 14 days of quarantine. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was one of four English Premier League players in the Argentina squad for the game away to arch-rivals Brazil. The match was suspended minutes after kick off when officials from Brazil’s health regulator came onto the pitch to stop the England-based players from playing because, according to the body, they had not completed the required 14-day quarantine on arrival in Sao Paulo. read more Martinez told reporters none of the Argentina players sheltering in the dressing room knew what was going on as officials at the side of the pitch discussed whether or not the match could continue. “We spent half an hour waiting to see if we could restart but after 40 minutes they told us we had to leave,” he said in Buenos Aires. “Then there was this despair, if I’d have to stay with the England lads for 14 days. It was all so uncertain. “We didn’t understand what was going on,” he added. Martinez plus Tottenham Hotspur defender Cristian Romero and midfielder Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of the Argentina lineup, while Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia was in the stands. “Obviously there had been rumours that the Premier League players wouldn’t play in the game but they would have told us when we arrived in Brazil and so we didn’t make any big show about cancelling the match,” said Martinez. “It was simple, we were going to win and we felt good.” PAIR RELEASED The Argentina squad were allowed to fly to Buenos Aires on Sunday night and Martinez and fellow Villa player midfielder Emiliano Buendia were released on Monday morning and permitted to rejoin their club. “Villa did not understand why it happened, but everyone saw it,” Martinez said before flying out. “It was supposed to be a great game for us to enjoy, not a spectacle.” The farcical scenes were an embarrassment for South American football and came at the end of a turbulent week. Some European sides had stopped their players travelling to South America because they would have to quarantine on return and potentially miss important club matches. Brazil were without nine key players, and other nations, Paraguay and Uruguay among them, also had some players missing. But Martinez, who established himself as first choice during Argentina’s triumphant Copa America campaign in June and July, said there was no way he would have given up playing for his country. “The four from England decided to go because we love the shirt,” he said. “No matter how much the Premier League (players) didn’t want to come, we decided we were going anyway. Because after the Copa America, everyone wanted to be there. ""It’s something beautiful and we must live with the consequences. On a personal level I needed to play these games.” Brazil lead the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022, six points ahead of second-placed Argentina.

Analysis: Turkey and UAE rein in dispute that fuelled conflict and hurt economy,5128,"ANKARA, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A truce between bitter regional rivals Turkey and the United Arab Emirates has calmed tensions that fuelled conflicts including Libya's war, officials and diplomats say, after years of animosity and insults. But with political differences still running deep, the two countries are expected to focus on building economic ties and de-escalating, rather than resolving, an ideological rift that has drawn a faultline through the Middle East. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the UAE's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, spoke by phone last week following contacts between intelligence and government officials. Erdogan, who a year ago said Turkey could cut diplomatic relations with Abu Dhabi after it set up ties with Israel, also discussed UAE investment in Turkey with Abu Dhabi's national security adviser. ""The UAE is interested in exploring prospects of reinforcing ties,"" an Emirati official said, pointing to trade and investment opportunities in transportation, health and energy. The talks follow earlier efforts by Turkey to ease tensions with UAE allies Saudi Arabia and Egypt, with a delegation from Cairo due in Ankara on Tuesday. Those contacts have so far yielded little, but some see the UAE track moving more swiftly. ""It's going very fast,"" said a diplomat in the Gulf. ""Faster than many people thought it would. They have turned the page."" A senior Turkish official described Erdogan's call last week with Sheikh Mohammed as a significant move towards overcoming disputes which have plagued their relations, saying the two countries could work together in the Middle East. ""But first there will be steps taken in terms of the economy,"" the official said. Other issues ""are not agreed, but a desire was formed (to tackle) the large part of these problems."" COST OF RIVALRY The rift stems from the Arab uprisings, when Turkey backed the Muslim Brotherhood and their Islamist allies challenging entrenched autocrats from Tunisia to Syria - alarming the UAE's dynastic rulers, who see the Brotherhood as a political and security threat. Turkey also sided with Qatar in a Gulf dispute, putting it at odds with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, while Turkish support last year helped Libya's U.N.-backed government drive back UAE-supported forces trying to seize the capital. The two countries have traded accusations of interference beyond their borders, and Erdogan once chided the UAE's foreign minister as an impudent nouveau riche when he retweeted comments critical of Ottoman forces - forebears of modern Turkey. In Somalia, Turkey and the UAE have competed for influence. In Syria, Turkey still supports fighters opposed to President Bashar al-Assad while the UAE, which once backed rebels fighting him, has opened an embassy in Damascus. Turkish officials and Gulf diplomats say both countries recognise their geopolitical tensions came at an economic price, heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. That cost was felt particularly by Erdogan in Turkey, where stubbornly high 19% inflation has driven up the cost of living and where state banks sold $128 billion in foreign reserves last year in an attempt to support the tumbling lira. ""The cost of strained ties is not sustainable in the region when it comes to Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia,"" a second Turkish official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The departure of U.S. President Donald Trump removed a leader who emboldened their rival regional interventions. Although no agreement has been announced on investments, the two countries already have an economic platform to build on. Unlike Saudi Arabia, which maintains an unofficial boycott of Turkish exports, the UAE says it remains Turkey's largest regional trading partner. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth funds have also made significant recent investments in Turkey's online grocer Getir and e-commerce platform Trendyol. Political differences will be harder to overcome, with Egypt and its Gulf allies insistent that Ankara pull out troops and Turkey-backed Syrian fighters from Libya, a demand which diplomats say is a priority for Cairo and its allies. Nevertheless, a decade on from the ""Arab Spring"" the revolutions are mostly over and the Muslim Brotherhood has been weakened - easing two of Abu Dhabi's main sources of friction with Erdogan, who strongly backed Brotherhood figures. ""For Saudi Arabia and the UAE this is not the priority file that it used to be,"" said Galip Dalay, a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. In a gesture to Cairo earlier this year, which would also have been noted in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, Turkey asked Egyptian opposition channels including Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist-leaning broadcasters, to tone down criticism of Egypt. Turkey still blocks access to the websites of some UAE organisations, including the state news agency, but the government has halted what was once a regular barrage of criticism directed at the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. ""There is a desire on both sides to de-escalate, and see what happens,"" Dalay said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Russian aluminium giant says could recall personnel from Guinea if crisis worsens,2257,"MOSCOW, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Russia's Rusal (RUAL.MM), said on Monday it aimed to keep its three major bauxite mines and one alumina refinery in Guinea operating after the military coup there, but could evacuate all Russian personnel if the crisis worsened. Moscow has a long history of relations with Conakry that goes back to trade and economic cooperation during the Soviet era, and is currently focused mainly on the metals business. The coup in the West African nation with the world's largest bauxite reserves, used to produce aluminium, sent prices of the metal to a 10-year high on Monday. There was no immediate indication of any supply disruptions. read more Rusal, the world's third largest aluminium producer, is a big presence in Guinea's key bauxite industry with its mines accounting for 42% of Rusal's total bauxite capacity. ""In connection with the events taking place in the Republic of Guinea, Rusal's number one priority is the health and safety of its employees and the continuity of its production processes,"" Rusal said in a statement. ""In case of further escalation, the company is considering options for the evacuation of Russian personnel from the republic,"" it added. Russia-focused producer Nordgold operates the Lefa gold mine in Guinea, which accounted for 17% of Nordgold's total production in 2020. ""Nordgold remains unaffected by the current political situation in Guinea and our mine site continue to operate as normal... We are monitoring the situation closely,"" Nordgold said in a statement. The Russian foreign ministry called on the Guinean military to immediately release President Alpha Conde as itjoined other nations in denouncing Sunday's coup. read more ""Moscow opposes any attempt at unconstitutional change of leadership,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""We demand the release of Mr Conde and a guarantee of his immunity. We consider it necessary to return the situation in Guinea to constitutional norms as soon as possible.""

UK PM's planned tax hike for social care triggers fury within ruling party,4682,"LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to hike taxes to fund social care has provoked fury among many of his own lawmakers, who fear that such a clear violation of his election promises shows he is happy to oversee a sweeping expansion of the state. After the fiscal splurge on the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson is now addressing Britain's creaking social care system, whose costs will soar as the population ages, while facing numerous other thorny policy matters. Johnson wants to raise the National Insurance (NI) tax paid by working people to subsidise care for pensioners, including wealthy retirees, according to British media. But many lawmakers from Johnson's own Conservative Party worry this will hurt younger, low-income workers and breach his 2019 election guarantee not to raise the rate of NI - which still adorns the Conservatives' website. ""The proposal will be aimed at supporting the more affluent, but the tax will be paid by lower income earners. That's unfair,"" one Conservative lawmaker, who declined to be named, told Reuters. ""We shouldn't break solemn election promises unless there are hugely good reasons to do so."" Like many other Western leaders, Johnson is facing demands to spend more on welfare after government borrowing ballooned to 14.2% of economic output - a level last seen at the end of World War Two. The row over his planned tax hike comes after charges that Britain was unprepared for the chaotic fall of Afghanistan, while the country is also facing labour shortages and supply chain problems exacerbated by Brexit, as well as a high COVID-19 death toll. Johnson is due to address parliament on the Afghanistan situation later on Monday, and the BBC said he would shortly announce a new 5.5 billion pound ($7.6 billion) package for the National Health Service. Details of the NI hike are likely to come later, possibly on Tuesday. 'TAX-AND-SPEND' For years, British leaders have been trying to find a way to pay for social care without endangering support by hiking taxes. Johnson said he had a plan for social care in 2019. British ministers are still thrashing out the details but Johnson had been expected to announce a roughly 1 percentage point increase on the rate of NI paid by workers and their employers, which official estimates show would raise around 10 billion pounds a year. ""With regards to our plans for social care, we are committed to setting out long-term sustainable reform of the sector and that is what we will do,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters on Monday. The finance ministry declined to comment. While Johnson's huge majority of 80 in parliament means a defeat may be unlikely, members of his own cabinet have hinted at their opposition to tax hikes. House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg on Sunday invoked former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who came to regret saying ""Read my lips: no new taxes"" during the 1988 election campaign. ""(Voters) remembered those words after President Bush had forgotten them,"" Rees-Mogg wrote in a Sunday Express opinion piece. Many of Johnson's lawmakers fear raising taxes will alienate many of the voters in northern England who supported him in the 2019 election, when he promised explicitly not to raise income tax, Value-Added Tax or National Insurance. BIGGEST EVER BENEFIT CUT Johnson also promised in 2019 to maintain the ""triple lock"", which annually links the state pension to whichever is highest out of inflation, earnings or a 2.5% increase. Owing to a statistical quirk during the pandemic, the official measure of earnings is running at almost 9% - which would result in a bumper payout to pensioners just as the government has stressed the need to tighten belts. ""Given that average wage levels have been skewed by the unprecedented events of the past 18 months, the (finance minister) should temporarily suspend the wages element of the lock,"" said Mel Stride, who heads parliament's Treasury Committee of lawmakers. Johnson faces more widespread resistance to plans to remove a 20 pounds-per-week increase to state benefits, known as Universal Credit, that was introduced at the height of the pandemic. The move would affect 4.4 million households from mid-October. ""If the (government) goes ahead with this cut, it would be the largest overnight benefit reduction that has ever happened,"" researchers Torsten Bell, Adam Corlett and Daniel Tomlinson said in a report published by the Resolution Foundation think tank on Monday. ""That should give policy makers reason to pause as to whether this is a good idea – politically, economically or morally."" ($1 = 0.7225 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
India plans 50% increase in oxygen production before third COVID-19 wave,2115,"BENGALURU, Sept 6 (Reuters) - India aims to ramp up its medical oxygen production capacity to 15,000 tonnes per day before a potential third wave of coronavirus infections that is expected to hit the country as soon as mid-September, an industry executive said. The target implies a 50% jump from the maximum output of almost 10,000 tonnes reached earlier this year during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave, when hospitals ran short of the gas and relatives of patients had to search out oxygen cylinders. Linde India (LIND.NS) supplied nearly one-third of the total oxygen demand during the peak. Moloy Banerjee, head of Linde South Asia, said that while the government is targeting 15,000 tonnes of medical oxygen per day, Linde and other manufacturers were hoping to hit production of at least 13,500 tonnes per day ahead of the third wave. As of Monday, India's total COVID-19 cases had reached 33.03 million, with the death toll at 440,752, according to health ministry data. While demand for medical oxygen in India has considerably reduced since the peak, reaching near pre-COVID levels, gas companies along with the government are gearing up for a scenario where the third wave could be worse than the previous one. The New Delhi government said last month it will increase oxygen production by setting up new manufacturing units or expanding the production capacity of existing units for uninterrupted oxygen supply during a health crisis. Shares of Linde India rose to record levels in the days following the Delhi government's notification and have more than doubled for the year as of Monday's closing price. ""There have been discussions with the Delhi government since the second wave of COVID-19. We are still reviewing the policy and trying to see if it is workable for Linde,"" Banerjee added. The company has not entered any formal agreement with the government. Linde has also been in touch with the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states to support setting up of additional oxygen storage capacities and manufacturing units.

JD.com says founder Liu to step away from day-to-day operations,2910,"SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China's JD.com (9618.HK) said on Monday founder and chief executive Richard Liu will switch his focus to the e-commerce giant's long-term strategy, creating the new role of president to run the company's day-to-day operations. The move comes as several other founders of China's tech companies have gradually relinquished the top job, such as at Alibaba and ByteDance, although Liu, 48, will retain his title as chief executive and his board seat. The new role of president will be filled by Xu Lei, currently CEO of JD's biggest division, who has taken on a more prominent public role at the company in recent years. Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, will also spend more time mentoring younger management and contributing to the revitalisation of rural areas, JD said in a statement. ""Looking to the future, the correct long-term strategic design, the growth and development of young talents, and the healthy and coordinated development of various business units will continue to be the driving force for JD, in doing the hardest and most challenging, but right and most valuable things for the industry,"" Liu said in the statement. Liu owns nearly 80% of JD's voting power, according to its 2020 annual report, and some investors have previously raised concerns his tight control, coupled with the lack of an obvious successor, had posed a management risk. His control of the company became a focus after he was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in 2017 following a rape allegation, which he denied. Liu was not charged but the incident caused a storm on Chinese social media. Citi analysts said Xu's promotion reflected the way he had proven his leadership and management skills in spearheading JD Retail's operations and he was a potential successor to Liu. ""We believe if Mr. Xu further proves his management capability, we would not be surprised if he is positioned as a potential successor to Mr. Richard Liu should Mr. Liu decide to step down one day,"" they said in a Monday note. Xin Lijun, who previously headed up JD Health (6618.HK), will take over from Xu as JD Retail's chief while Jin Enlin will become JD Health's new CEO. Following Xu's promotion, Liu will retain his board seat and position as CEO of JD.com, a company spokesperson confirmed. In 2019, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) co-founder Jack Ma formally stepped down as chairman of the e-commerce giant, handing over reigns to Daniel Zhang. In 2021, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming announced he would step down from his role as CEO, while Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) founder stepped down as chairman following an earlier resignation of his CEO title. Chinese authorities have also launched a wave of new industry regulations and penalties since late 2020, many of which have targeted the internet sector in particular.

McIlroy lends support to Osaka over decision to take break,1589,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Golfer Rory McIlroy has backed Naomi Osaka's decision to take a break from tennis following the Japanese world number three's elimination from the U.S. Open last week, saying that it was important that athletes did not let results define them. A tearful Osaka told reporters that she would be taking some time off from the sport after crashing out in the third round at Flushing Meadows to 19-year-old Leylah Fernandez, adding that she had been struggling with anxiety and depression over the last few years. Speaking after his final round at the Tour Championship -- where he finished tied for 14th -- McIlroy said that he had faced similar difficulties in his own career.

"Taliban tells Berlin it will welcome German companies, aid",2461,"BERLIN, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban would welcome German investment in Afghanistan and help in areas including humanitarian aid, health care, education and infrastructure, the group's spokesman told Bild newspaper. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan last month as foreign forces pulled out after a 20-year mission, and the country is facing an economic collapse and humanitarian crisis while donors and governments weigh up how to deal with the new leaders. Germany, acting in concert with the European Union, has laid out conditions to resume a diplomatic presence in Kabul and unfreeze development aid, urging the Taliban to respect human rights, particularly those of women. read more ""The German government could encourage its entrepreneurs to come and invest in our country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an interview with Bild published on Monday. The Taliban would pave the way for investments and ensure companies' security, he said. Germany maintained close relations with Afghanistan in the past and after the fall of the first Taliban government in 2001 hosted a conference in Bonn that was supposed to lay the foundation for a democratic Afghanistan. The hardline Islamist group has sought to present a more moderate face this time. read more ""We would like to revive the friendly atmosphere that existed between Afghans and Germans. The next government will be based on a friendly relationship with Germany,"" Mujahid said. ""We would like Germany to support us in the humanitarian sector, and we need help in the health care sector, in the area of education and with the infrastructure,"" he added He also said the Taliban would be ""very happy"" to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel - who is about to step down as Germany's leader - for a visit in Afghanistan. German citizens living in the country and Afghans who have cooperated with Germany in the past should not be afraid of the Taliban and there would be no problems, Mujahid said. Those among them who wanted to leave the country will have to take the legal route, he added.

McIlroy lends support to Osaka over decision to take break,1589,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Golfer Rory McIlroy has backed Naomi Osaka's decision to take a break from tennis following the Japanese world number three's elimination from the U.S. Open last week, saying that it was important that athletes did not let results define them. A tearful Osaka told reporters that she would be taking some time off from the sport after crashing out in the third round at Flushing Meadows to 19-year-old Leylah Fernandez, adding that she had been struggling with anxiety and depression over the last few years. Speaking after his final round at the Tour Championship -- where he finished tied for 14th -- McIlroy said that he had faced similar difficulties in his own career. ""I spoke about this in 2019 about separating who I am as a golfer and who I am as a person and trying to not let that define me, and it seems what Naomi is going through at the minute is that same thing,"" said the four-time major winner. ""How can I play tennis and enjoy it and not let the results define who I am... I think everyone just needs to let her have time to figure that out."" Osaka has received support from various athletes, including tennis greats Billie Jean King and Boris Becker, as well former American sprinter Michael Johnson, with many praising her for bringing to the fore a new discussion around mental health. read more McIlroy added: ""She seems like a really smart girl, and hopefully she'll be able to do it and come back and start enjoying the game just like when she picked the racket up when she was a little girl.""

"Taliban tells Berlin it will welcome German companies, aid",2461,"BERLIN, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban would welcome German investment in Afghanistan and help in areas including humanitarian aid, health care, education and infrastructure, the group's spokesman told Bild newspaper. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan last month as foreign forces pulled out after a 20-year mission, and the country is facing an economic collapse and humanitarian crisis while donors and governments weigh up how to deal with the new leaders. Germany, acting in concert with the European Union, has laid out conditions to resume a diplomatic presence in Kabul and unfreeze development aid, urging the Taliban to respect human rights, particularly those of women. read more ""The German government could encourage its entrepreneurs to come and invest in our country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an interview with Bild published on Monday. The Taliban would pave the way for investments and ensure companies' security, he said. Germany maintained close relations with Afghanistan in the past and after the fall of the first Taliban government in 2001 hosted a conference in Bonn that was supposed to lay the foundation for a democratic Afghanistan. The hardline Islamist group has sought to present a more moderate face this time. read more ""We would like to revive the friendly atmosphere that existed between Afghans and Germans. The next government will be based on a friendly relationship with Germany,"" Mujahid said. ""We would like Germany to support us in the humanitarian sector, and we need help in the health care sector, in the area of education and with the infrastructure,"" he added He also said the Taliban would be ""very happy"" to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel - who is about to step down as Germany's leader - for a visit in Afghanistan. German citizens living in the country and Afghans who have cooperated with Germany in the past should not be afraid of the Taliban and there would be no problems, Mujahid said. Those among them who wanted to leave the country will have to take the legal route, he added.

Sinovac booster shot reverses drop in antibody activities against Delta-study,2054,"BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - A booster dose of Sinovac Biotech's (SVA.O) COVID-19 vaccine reversed a decline in antibody activities against the Delta variant, a study showed, easing some concerns about its longer-term immune response to the highly contagious strain of the virus. The study comes amid concerns about the Chinese vaccine's efficacy against Delta, which has become the dominant variant globally and is driving a surge in new infections even in the most vaccinated countries. Several countries which have relied heavily on the Sinovac vaccine have begun giving booster shots developed by Western manufacturers to people fully vaccinated with the Chinese shot. Neutralising antibody activities against Delta were not detected in samples taken from vaccine recipients six months after they received the second dose of Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine, according to the study published on Sunday before a peer review. But recipients of booster shots showed over 2.5-fold higher neutralizing potency against Delta about four weeks after the third dose, compared with the level seen about four weeks after the second shot, researchers from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Furan University, Sinovac, and other Chinese institutions said in the paper. They did not discuss how specifically changes in antibody activity will affect Sinovac shot's efficacy in preventing people from getting sick from the variant. The lab study involves samples from 66 participants, including 38 volunteers who received either two or three doses of the vaccine. The World Health Organization plans to ship around 100 million doses of the Sinovac and Sinopharm COVID-19 shots by the end of this month, mostly to Africa and Asia, in its first delivery of Chinese vaccines. But some countries rejected accepting the vaccines, citing lack of data on their effectiveness against Delta. read more Around 1.8 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been supplied globally including China by end August, according to the company.

India's Hetero gets emergency use nod to make Roche's COVID-19 drug,1166,"BENGALURU, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Indian drug developer Hetero said on Monday it has received emergency use approval from the country's health authorities to make a generic version of Roche Holding AG's (ROG.S) COVID-19 drug. Hetero expects to make the treatment, tocilizumab, available in India by the end of the month under the brand name Tocira. Tocilizumab has been facing a global shortage as the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant drives up cases in several countries. COVID-19 cases in India have declined from levels hit during the second wave in April and May, although health experts believe that the country should brace for a third wave by October.

Brazil v Argentina suspended after health officials intervene over quarantine breach,4886,"SAO PAULO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A World Cup qualifier between Argentina and Brazil was suspended amid farcical scenes on Sunday after Brazilian health authorities accused a number of Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Tottenham duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of the Argentine line-up when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa invaded the pitch and stopped the game around five minutes after kickoff. The trio, along with Aston Villa’s Emiliano Buendia, who was in the stands, had reportedly breached Brazilian rules stating that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country, unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. The regulations were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 583,000 Brazilians. While the visitingteam quickly left the field, the two coaches, along with Argentina captain Lionel Messi and the Brazilian players, gathered at the side of the pitch to discuss the stoppage. ""Why did they start the game and stop it after five minutes?"" Messi said in comments heard on television. ""We've been here at the stadium for an hour, they could have told us."" Messi then returned to the dressing room and at 5pm local time, an hour after the game kicked off, the match was officially suspended. “The referee and the match official will take a report to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee and they will decide what steps to take,” said a statement issued by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). Anvisa said they had issued ample warnings that the four Argentines were in contravention of Brazilian health regulations. Argentine officials were told on Saturday the four should isolate and when the instructions were ignored, Anvisa asked Brazilian federal police to enforce the isolation ruling on Sunday morning, the regulator said. Their attempts were ""frustrated,"" Anvisa said in a statement issued late on Sunday. Brazilian Football Confederation president said he was “indignant” with the scenes that reverberated around the football world. Ednaldo Rodrigues criticised Anvisa and said officials told him the Argentines who breached the country's COVID-19 rules could have been deported after the game. Soccer Football - World Cup - South American Qualifiers - Brazil v Argentina - Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo, Brazil - September 5, 2021 Players and officials are seen on the pitch as play is interrupted after Brazilian health officials objected to the participation of three Argentine players they say broke quarantine rules REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli “I feel sorry for all the sports fans who wanted to watch the game on television,” he told Brazil’s Sportv. “With all due respect to Anvisa, they could have resolved this earlier and not waited for the game to start.” A shellshocked Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni agreed. “It makes me so sad, I am not looking for guilty parties, whatever happened or didn’t happen, this wasn’t the time to do it,” he told Argentine broadcaster TyC Sports. “We wanted to enjoy a game between the best in the world and it ends up like this.” “As a coach I am going to defend my players. If people come and say we want to take this guy or deport this guy there was no chance of that,"" he said. ""Because at no time were we told we couldn't play the game."" Argentine officials believed the same protocols used in the Copa America in Brazil in June were in place for the World Cup qualifiers to allow teams to travel across the continent. CONMEBOL confirmed that interpretation. FALSE DETAILS In a statement Anvisa said it had received reports that the four Argentine players had provided “false information” on their pre-flight health declarations. ""Anvisa considers the situation a serious health risk and so has asked local health authorities to determine the immediate quarantine of the players, who are stopped from participating in any activity and should be prevented from remaining on Brazilian soil,"" Anvisa said in a statement. The confusion comes amid continuing anger in South America at rules which have robbed several teams of key players for this month’s three World Cup qualifiers. Brazil were without nine key men for Argentina game, and other South American sides have also lost players due to a decision by some European clubs not to let their players travel to the continent. They would have had to quarantine when they returned to Europe and the clubs do not want to lose their players for subsequent league games. Brazil lead the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022, six points ahead of second-placed Argentina. The top four qualify automatically for Qatar.

"Florida gunman kills 4 including baby, wounds 11-year-old girl",2303,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - A self-described survivalist in body armor shot and killed four people, including a woman and her 3-month-old baby boy in her arms, before surrendering to police in central Florida on Sunday, officials said. The shooter, identified as Bryan Riley, 33, a former U.S. Marine, also wounded an 11-year-old girl who underwent surgery for seven gunshot injuries, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told a news conference. Riley, who had no connection to the victims, engaged in a shootout with police before giving up, and later tried to grab a police officer's gun while being treated in the hospital for his own gunshot wound, before being subdued again, Judd said. A veteran of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Riley was working as a bodyguard and a security guard. His girlfriend of four years told investigators he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and occasional depression, Judd said. About a week ago his mental health worsened and he told his girlfriend he had started speaking with God, Judd said. ""He said at one point to our detectives, 'They begged for their lives and I killed them anyway',"" Judd said at a second news conference. Riley also told sheriff's deputies he was high on methamphetamine, Judd said. The shooter first appeared randomly at the house where the shooting occurred on Saturday night, making nonsensical statements, but left by the time police responded. He returned early Sunday morning, killing a 40-year-old man, the 33-year-old mother and her baby boy, Judd said. In the home next door, he also killed the 62-year-old mother of the woman, Judd said. ""In addition to that, if he's not evil enough, he shot and killed the family dog,"" Judd said. Deputies responding to reports of two volleys of automatic gunfire arrived to find the suspect unarmed outside, wearing camouflage and body armor. Riley then went back inside and ""we heard another volley, and a woman scream, and a baby whimper,"" Judd said. A gunfight ensued before he came out unarmed and was arrested. ""It would have been nice if he would have come out with a gun ... We would have shot him up a lot. But he didn't because he was a coward,"" Judd said. ""When someone chooses to give up, we take them into custody peacefully."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Each COVID-19 surge poses a risk for healthcare workers: PTSD,5513,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - Nurse Chris Prott's knees jump, his heart races, his mouth goes dry and his mind floods with dark memories when he talks about working in the Milwaukee VA Medical Center's intensive care unit (ICU) during pandemic surges. Prott shares a struggle common to many of the military veterans for whom he has cared for years: symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prott was among a half dozen ICU staffers who told Reuters of symptoms such as waking from nightmares bathed in sweat; flashbacks to dying patients during the pandemic's fear-filled early days; flaring anger; and panic at the sound of medical alarms. Those whose symptoms last longer than one month and are severe enough to interfere with daily life can be diagnosed with PTSD. The surging Delta variant is heaping on fresh trauma as the United States and other nations begin to study PTSD in health workers. Data already showed that U.S. health workers were in crisis before COVID-19. While PTSD is associated with combat, it can arise among civilians after natural disasters, abuse or other trauma. Health workers can be reluctant to equate their experience with that of returning soldiers. ""I feel like a schmuck calling it PTSD,"" Prott said. ""It took me a long time to be able to talk to somebody because I see guys with real PTSD. What I've got going on, it's nothing in comparison, so you feel guilty for thinking that."" Psychiatrist Dr. Bessel van der Kolk knows better. ""On the surface, a nurse at your local hospital will not look like a guy coming back from Afghanistan,"" said the author of ""The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma."" ""But underneath it all, we have these core neurobiology-determined functions that are the same."" Pre-pandemic studies showed that rates of PTSD in front-line health workers varied from 10% to 50%. The suicide rate among doctors was more than twice that of the general public. The American Medical Association (AMA) has tapped a military psychologist and the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) National Center for PTSD to help it measure the pandemic's impact. Texas Tech University Health Science Center psychiatry resident Dr. Huseyin Bayazit and researchers in his native Turkey surveyed 1,833 Turkish health workers last autumn. The results, presented in May at an American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed a PTSD rate of 49.5% among nonphysicians and 36% for doctors. Rates of suicidal thoughts increased as workers spent more time on COVID-19 units. Unions want to mitigate trauma by setting national rules for the number of patients under each nurse’s care. Workers say they should not have to pay for therapy, medication, and other interventions. Nurse Chris Prott examines a patient in the urgent care department at the Iron Mountain VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, U.S., August 25, 2021. John Jamison/Handout via REUTERS The AMA and other groups want more confidentiality for doctors who seek mental health services. Most ICU staff who discussed PTSD with Reuters requested anonymity for fear of repercussions at work. New York's Mount Sinai Health System and Chicago's Rush University System for Health provide free, confidential mental health services. Mount Sinai's new Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth offers a military-inspired ""Battle Buddies"" peer-support program for nurses. A chaplain from Rush's ""Road Home"" program for veterans runs a ""post-traumatic growth"" bereavement support group for ICU nurses. The VA system provides no-cost, short-term mental health counseling through its employee assistance program. Many local VA facilities supplement those with spiritual counseling and crisis incident response teams, a spokesperson said. 'YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT' About 5,000 U.S. physicians quit every two years due to burnout, said Dr. Christine Sinsky, an AMA vice president. The annual cost is about $4.6 billion - including lost revenue from vacancies and recruitment expenses, she said. Hospital survey results in March led the Department of Health and Human Services to warn ""staffing shortages have affected patient care, and that exhaustion and trauma have taken a toll on staff's mental health."" Trauma surgeon Dr. Kari Jerge volunteered to work in a Phoenix COVID-19 ward during last winter's surge. She turned down substantially more pay to return to the ICU after the Delta variant surge. Jerge encourages others to prioritize ""self-preservation,"" but worries about the loss of expertise. ""There is infinite value in a nurse who's been working in the ICU for 20 years and just has a gut feeling when something's going wrong with a patient,"" she said. Nurse Pascaline Muhindura, 40, who cares for COVID-19 patients in Kansas City, Missouri, has advocated for health worker safety since losing a co-worker to the disease early in the pandemic. ""It keeps getting worse and worse. We are heading back to that place - that woke up those emotions again,"" said Muhindura, who added that many employers do not offer adequate insurance coverage for therapy. An ICU fosters the kind of camaraderie forged in battle. A group of Southern California COVID-19 nurses got matching tattoos. Health workers commiserate over crying their way home after tough shifts, support each other on social media, and push colleagues to seek help. ""There is nothing wrong with feeling this way,"" said VA nurse Prott. ""You have to deal with it though."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel to present COVID-19 booster shot data to FDA experts,1619,"JERUSALEM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Israel this month will present data from an extensive rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is weighing White House plans to begin a booster drive in the United States. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, said the ministry had been asked by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to brief its advisors at a Sept. 17 meeting. The virtual session will consider a third booster shot of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) vaccine, and may discuss others. read more ""We have been asked to come and present Israel's experience and our data so that we can truly help the whole world to learn,"" Alroy-Preis told Israeli Channel 12 TV news. A week ago Israel began offering a Pfizer COVID-19 booster to people as young as 12 in a campaign that began in July among seniors. Israeli health officials said the drive has slowed a rise in severe illness caused by the Delta variant. Officials have said the effectiveness of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine waned five months after administration, making a booster necessary. A third dose, they said, restored the level of protection of the second shot. So far 2.6 million people out of a population of 9.3 million have received three doses of the Pfizer vaccine in Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden had been expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20.

Column: Crafty lawyering on Texas abortion bill withstood SCOTUS challenge: Greene,5807,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sept 4 (Reuters) - Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, abortion opponents have been trying to scale back or undo it. Texas state senator Bryan Hughes, a former personal injury lawyer and author of the “Heartbeat Act,” led a team in succeeding, at least for now, where so many others have failed. As a social policy, the law, which imposes a near-total ban on abortions in Texas but leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, is deeply controversial. House speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said it “delivers catastrophe to women in Texas.” Still, some supporters stress that Hughes and the co-architects of the law, which included former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, deserve credit for what amounts to creative lawyering in drafting the measure, known as SB 8. These lawyers figured out how to apply qui tam statutes, which allow private citizens to pursue a lawsuit on behalf of the government, to receive an award in the abortion law context. Hughes, 52, in an interview said the new law “is a very elegant use of the judicial system.” The impetus for creating the unique state-wide legislation came after district attorneys around the country, including some in Texas, publicly stated they would not enforce laws that criminalized early abortions, said Hughes, a Republican from Mineola, Texas. His conclusion? “We had to find another way.” As a lawyer and legislator, he was familiar with qui tam statutes such as the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act, which allows private citizens to bring a fraud case and collect a bounty. “The concept was there,” Hughes said. SB 8’s enforcement mechanism also was modeled after an anti-abortion ordinance enacted by the town of Waskom, Texas, in 2019, Hughes said. The ordinance also delegates enforcement to private citizens bringing lawsuits. Mitchell, a former law clerk to the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, provided legal advice to anti-abortion advocates in drafting the ordinance, which was copied by about 30 other cities across the state. He declined to comment. “We continued to refine it,” Hughes said of the Waskom law. ""Lots of lawyers and law professors helped us out,” including Mitchell, whom he describes as a longtime friend and a “very sharp guy.” To John Seago, legislative director of anti-abortion advocacy group Texas Right to Life, the novelty of SB 8 “was that it expands who has standing and takes out the other (criminal) penalties and prohibits state action.” Under the statute, Texas officials have no authority to enforce the new law, which bars abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Private citizens alone are empowered to sue women and anyone who assists them for violating the ban. That private citizen component of the law was key in thwarting the abortion-provider plaintiffs, on procedural grounds, from winning an injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court. The defendants whom the abortion providers had named in the injunction action included a state court judge and a private citizen who allegedly threatened to sue women for seeking abortions. But as the high court majority noted, it's not clear that any of them ""can or will seek to enforce the Texas law against the applicants in a manner that might permit our intervention."" The private citizen, Mark Lee Dickson, said in an affidavit that he has no present intention to try to enforce the law, and no cases are before the judge. So who could the court seek to stop? According to both Hughes and Seago, no one has attempted to sue anyone for performing or assisting in a post-heartbeat abortion since the law went into effect on Sept. 1. Until someone does, SB 8 seems likely to stay on the books, shielded from judicial review. A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred Texas Right to Life from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce the new law. Still, SB 8 won’t get a free pass forever. The five-justice majority wrote that their decision “in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts.” It just might take awhile. In crafting the legislation, Hughes, who was elected to the state senate in 2016 and served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years prior, said he drew on his legal background. “Usually in politics, being a lawyer is a negative, but it does come in handy sometimes,"" he said. From 2003 to 2008, Hughes was a litigator at The Lanier Law Firm, which has scored billions of dollars in verdicts for plaintiffs in cases involving hip implants, diabetes medication and talcum powder. Founder Mark Lanier in an email described Hughes as “a gifted lawyer strongly motivated by what he thinks is right.” (This story corrects who can be sued under the Texas abortion law.

Spanish village hosts first bull running fiesta since pandemic,1615,"VILLASECA DE LA SAGRA, SPAIN, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Ten bulls charged through the streets of Villaseca de la Sagra on Sunday in pursuit of hundreds of runners as the first bull running fiesta was held in Spain since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Villages and towns across Spain hold the fiestas but they were prohibited last year as the country brought in tough health restrictions. Opposition to them has increased in recent years as Spanish society remains divided over the controversial issue of using bulls for sport. No-one was injured during the country's first run, in this village of 1,700 inhabitants which is 65 km (41 miles) south of Madrid.

""We were very excited. There were plenty of controls. If people respect restrictions, we can do this all over Spain,"" said Fernando Dominguez, 45, a market worker from Madrid. A 2020 poll, published by the survey company Electomania, found that 47% Spaniards backed banning bullfighting while 18.6% opposed prohibition and 37% opposed bullfighting but did not want it to be banned.

Vietnam sets deadline to vaccinate biggest cities' adults,1709,"HANOI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Vietnam's coronavirus epicentre, Ho Chi Minh City, and capital Hanoi must vaccinate all of their adult residents with at least one shot by Sept. 15, the ministry of health said on Sunday. Vietnam has one of the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates in the region, with only 3.3% of the country's 98 million people fully vaccinated with two shots, and 15.4% with one shot. The country is battling a worsening COVID-19 outbreak that has infected more than 520,000 people and killed 13,000, the vast majority in the past few months. Ho Chi Minh City, the country's business hub, accounts for half of the infections and 80% of the fatalities. The cities must ""mobilise all capable forces including private medical facilities, to vaccinate people at full capacity"", the ministry said in an emergency dispatch. Government data showed 88% of Ho Chi Minh City's adult population of 6.97 million have been inoculated with at least one shot. The rate is 53% for Hanoi's adult population of 5.75 million. The ministry also set the Sept. 15 deadline for the southern industrial provinces of Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long An to vaccinate all of their adult populations. It said Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong and Long An have been allocated enough vaccine doses for the vaccination drive. Vietnam has so far received 33 million coronavirus vaccine doses, and it expects to receive 17 million more by the end of this month, the government said late on Sunday.

All six Israel MPC members voted to keep rates unchanged-minutes,2367,"JERUSALEM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - All six rate setters at the Bank of Israel voted to keep the benchmark interest rate (ILINR=ECI) at 0.1% on Aug. 23, though one member believed it may be time to start tightening policy, minutes of the discussions showed on Sunday. For the second straight meeting, the monetary policy committee voted 6-0 to leave rates unchanged. The economy rebounded in the second quarter after most COVID-related restrictions were lifted, while inflation moved near a 2% rate. One member, the minutes said, was of the opinion that the strong economic data and the increase in the inflation environment ""could have made it possible to begin gradually reducing the extent of monetary policy accommodation"". ""However in view of the renewed increase in morbidity it is best to be very cautious and at this time to retain the current policy,"" the minutes said, citing the view of the policymaker. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annualised 15.4% in the April-June period from the prior three months, while the inflation rate reached 1.9% in July from below zero earlier in 2021. Yet, COVID-19 infections from the Delta variant have spiked in recent weeks, despite a rapid vaccination rollout in which many adults have already received a third shot although with the number of serious cases fairly low, officials are reluctant to impose a fourth lockdown. ""The Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity, in view of the increased health risks in Israel and abroad,"" the minutes said. ""Therefore, the (MPC) will continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary."" Policymakers noted ""there are no signs of an outbreak of inflation"" even though prices of non-tradable items continue to rise, while the rate of increase in prices of tradable goods was stable. At the same time, MPC members noted that economic activity returned to its long term trend in most industries but tourism, hospitality and culture continued to struggle. ""The committee will formulate its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support for the process of exiting the economic crisis, and will ensure that the credit market continues to function,"" the minutes showed.

UK minister: no decision yet on COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children,2054,"LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - British vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday said a decision had not yet been taken on whether healthy children aged 12- to 15-years-old should be vaccinated against COVID-19, following reports that a rollout could begin in the coming days. Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday declined to recommend vaccinations for children in that group, taking a precautionary approach due to a rare risk of heart inflammation, but adding the issue was finely balanced. read more The government is consulting medical advisers to seek advice on wider considerations, such as the impact on schools, and may still give the go-ahead to broad vaccination of the age group. Some newspapers reported confidence among ministers that the chief medical officers would swiftly back shots for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, but Zahawi said the government would not prejudge the decision. ""No decision will be made until we hear back from the chief medical officers,"" Zahawi told the BBC. Children are being widely vaccinated already in the United States, Israel and many European countries. British officials have emphasised that 12- to 15-year-olds who are vulnerable to COVID-19 are already eligible for vaccination, as well as all people over 16. The four nations of the United Kingdom, which have recorded 133,000 COVID deaths, control their own health policy, although all have followed JCVI advice on vaccine rollout thus far. Zahawi confirmed that proof of vaccination would be required in England for some large events from the end of this month once all adults have been offered two shots. read more He also said that the government was still finalising plans for a vaccine booster programme following interim advice from the JCVI that one might be needed for the vulnerable and elderly. read more ""It is very likely that we will begin boosting those groups, as... I hope the interim then becomes final advice, by the middle of this month,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand tried to deport attacker for years after he arrived as refugee,3607,"WELLINGTON/COLOMBO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - New Zealand had tried for years to deport the knife-wielding militant who wounded seven people at a mall in Auckland last week, the government said after it released more details on the attacker following the lifting of a court suppression order. Court documents made public on Sunday identified the attacker as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, 32, an ethnic Tamil Muslim from Sri Lanka. He had arrived in New Zealand 10 years ago on a student visa seeking refugee status, which was granted in 2013. Police in Sri Lanka were making background checks on Samsudeen and talking to his family and friends for more information, said spokesperson Nalin Thalduwa. ""As far as I am aware the New Zealand government has not made a formal request for Sri Lanka to commence an investigation so we are simply gathering information at the moment,"" Thalduwa said. New Zealand police were following Samsudeen and shot him dead about a minute after he launched his attack on Friday after picking up a knife from a supermarket display. He had been convicted and imprisoned for about three years before being released in July. Samsudeen's family issued a statement to the New Zealand media describing their shock at the ""terrible event"". After his arrest Samsudeen ""used to call me once every three months or so. We felt his change and everyone used to scold him, especially his two bothers,"" his mother, who lives in the Muslim-majority town of Kattankudy on Sri Lanka's eastern coast, told a local news channel. Samsudeen was inspired by the Islamic State militant group and was being monitored constantly but he could not be kept in prison by law any longer, the New Zealand government has said. He came to the attention of the police and security services in 2016 after he expressed sympathy on Facebook for militant attacks, violent war-related videos and comments advocating violent extremism. The authorities say they later discovered his refugee status was fraudulently obtained, so the government sought to cancel his visa and issued deportation notices. But Samsudeen appealed against the deportation, and since he was in prison, his appeal could not proceed until his criminal trial ended in May this year. The attack has led to questions about a loophole in New Zealand's counterterrorism laws that allowed Samsudeen to remain free despite authorities being aware of the threat he posed. The government has promised to tighten the law, in particular to criminalise planning a militant attack. ""We will continue to review our immigration laws alongside the terrorist suppression law, and I'm sure if there are ways we can improve it, we will,"" Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson told a news conference. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement on Saturday that unsuccessful attempts to deport Samsudeen were a ""frustrating process"" for the government. Of the seven people wounded in the attack three are in critical condition. One has been released from hospital. Samsudeen's family said in the statement they were heartbroken. ""We hope to find out with you all, what happened in Aathil's case and what we all could have done to prevent this,"" the family said in the statement, released by his brother Aroos. The family said Samsudeen was suffering from mental health problems and his condition got worse over the past 10 years as he spent more time in prison and dealing with court cases. ""He wanted to share the sufferings and injustices. He saw himself as someone fighting those injustices,"" the family said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Brazil health regulator suspends use of 12 mln Sinovac vaccine shots,1397,"SAO PAULO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Brazil's federal health regulator Anvisa on Saturday suspended the use of over 12 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O) that were produced in an unauthorized plant, it said in a statement. Anvisa said it was alerted on Friday by Sao Paulo's Butantan institute, a biomedical center that has partnered with Sinovac to locally fill and finish the vaccines, that 25 batches, or 12.1 million doses, sent to Brazil had been made in the plant. ""The manufacturing unit ... was not inspected and was not approved by Anvisa in the authorization of emergency use of the mentioned vaccine,"" the regulator said.

Hurricane Ida death toll in Louisiana rises to 12,3239,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida's toll rose to 12 storm deaths in Louisiana on Saturday, still far outpaced by the dozens killed in flooded Northeast U.S. states where President Biden is heading next week to assess damage. New York and New Jersey were among the four northern states that started the Labor Day holiday weekend digging through debris left by the deadly deluge that killed more than 44 people and caused public transportation in New York City to grind to a halt. Transportation operators promised to restore some lines before the start of the workweek on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden will visit storm-ravaged New Jersey and New York on Tuesday, just days after he traveled to hard-hit Louisiana where the storm made landfall almost a week ago. His Northeast travels will include Manville, New Jersey, and the Queens borough of New York City, the White House said. read more The confirmed storm-related death toll in Louisiana rose to 12 on Saturday, Governor Bel Edwards told a news conference. He warned those numbers could increase because so many people are relying on power from generators, which were blamed for four carbon monoxide deaths among the 12 deaths, the governor said. More than 718,500 customers in Louisiana are still without power, down from the 1.1 million people that Hurricane Ida's devastation initially left in the dark, the governor said. After Biden mentioned the possibility of using a cruise ship to house workers trying to restore power, the Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line said it would deploy its Grand Classica flagship to New Orleans to house 1,500 front line workers under a charter agreement with Entergy Corp. “Hurricane relief and humanitarian charters are something we’ve done several times in the past, and we are proud to be able to move quickly to action now in this way, helping facilitate relief for the thousands of people who remain without power across the region,"" Kevin Sheehan, president of the cruise line, said in a statement. Two new deaths in Louisiana were among evacuated nursing home residents at a Tangipahoa Parish warehouse now under state investigation after reports of squalid conditions. ""Sadly, we also can now confirm 2 additional deaths among nursing home residents who had been evacuated to the Tangipahoa facility,"" the Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Saturday. ""This brings the death toll of nursing home residents evacuated to this facility to 6,"" the health department tweeted.

AUSTIN, Texas/NEW YORK Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. companies including Lyft Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and Silicon Laboratories Inc voiced their displeasure on Friday at new Texas laws on abortion, handguns, and voting limitations, a fresh sign of increased efforts by some firms to signal their commitment to social responsibility. Lyft (LYFT.O) and Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) said they will cover all legal fees for the ride-hail companies' drivers sued under a law that puts in place a near-total ban on abortion. Lyft will also donate $1 million to women's health provider Planned Parenthood, chief executive Logan Green said on Twitter. ""This is an attack on women's access to healthcare and on their right to choose,"" Green said of the new Texas law. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted in response to Green's announcement that his company would cover drivers' legal fees in the same way, thanking Green for taking the initiative. The ban, which took effect Wednesday, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. This potentially includes drivers who unknowingly take women to clinics for abortion procedures. The Lyft Driver Hub is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 20, 2019. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson On Wednesday, Tinder-owner Match Group's (MTCH.O) CEO and rival dating platform Bumble Inc (BMBL.O) said they were setting up funds to help Texas-based employees seeking abortion care outside the state. Website hosting service GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) on Friday, meanwhile, shut down a Texas anti-abortion website that allowed people to report suspected abortions. The reaction to the law change in Texas comes at a time when many companies are seeking to burnish their corporate and environmental governance credentials with consumers. Companies also reacted to the Texas legislature this week passing the final version of a bill that outlaws drive-through and 24-hour voting locations and gives poll watchers more power, widely seen as restricting voting access. ""We hoped for a different outcome for this legislation, and we're disappointed by this result,"" an American Airlines (AAL.O) spokesperson said in an email. A spokesperson for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N), based in Texas, said, ""As a global company of 60,000 team members, HPE encourages our team members to engage in the political process where they live and work and make their voices heard through advocacy and at the voting booth."" Meanwhile, a law allowing people to carry concealed handguns without any permit went into effect in Texas on Wednesday. ""Looking at the abortion law, or the gun law, or the voting law, it's a form of vigilante justice, where you're empowering individuals to enforce the law,"" said Tyson Tuttle, the CEO of Austin-based Silicon Laboratories (SLAB.O). ""It's been a rough week in Texas and a harbinger of what's to come across the country."""

""I feel like I'm kind of at this point where I'm trying to figure out what I want to do. Honestly I don't know when I'm going to play my next tennis match,"" she said, breaking down in tears at a post-match press conference and pulling the brim of her visor over her eyes. ""I think I'm going to take a break from playing for a while."" Playing in her first Grand Slam since pulling out of the French Open earlier this year and disclosing her battle with depression, Osaka's return to Flushing Meadows did not go to plan, as she wordlessly left the court after uncharacteristically losing her cool in the second set tiebreak. The third seed whacked her racquet and then flung it onto the court twice in frustration as Fernandez scored five straight points in the tiebreak, in a series of superb play. Osaka did not receive a warning or a code violation and left the court between sets, later telling reporters she struggled to contain her emotions. ""I'm really sorry about that,"" she said. ""I was telling myself to be calm, but I feel like maybe there was a boiling point. ""Like normally I feel like I like challenges. But recently I feel very anxious when things don't go my way, and I feel like you can feel that. I'm not really sure why it happens the way it happens now.""

In the ninth game Osaka rushed through her serves, not even waiting for the crowd to quiet down, as she was unable to create a single break point opportunity in the final set. A fan favourite, Osaka has struggled with uneven play since she withdrew from Roland Garros earlier this year amid a public row with tournament officials over required media appearances, which she said had a negative impact on her mental health. She told fans that she has struggled with depression for years, prompting new discussion around mental health in professional sport. ""How do I go around saying this? I feel like for me recently, like, when I win I don't feel happy. I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose, I feel very sad, said Osaka. ""I don't think that's normal."" FERNANDEZ BREAKTHROUGH It was a breakthrough performance for Fernandez, who reached the fourth round of a major for the first time just a few days shy of her 19th birthday. She fired off 28 winners across the three sets, and said in a televised interview that she worked at ""just finding the solutions"" during the match. ""She's a great server, she's been hitting aces left, right and centre,"" Fernandez said of Osaka. She told reporters she was able to rely on in her own serve, as well, as she won more than three quarters of her first-serve points and fired off six aces. ""I've been serving really well the past few matches. Today I just went on court with a lot of confidence on my serve, trusting it, trusting that I'm going to hit my targets when I needed to, and I did,"" she said.

Beef giant Brazil halts China exports after confirming two mad cow disease cases,1688,"SAO PAULO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, has suspended beef exports to its No. 1 customer China after confirming two cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease in two separate domestic meat plants, the agriculture ministry said on Saturday. The suspension, which is part of an animal health pact agreed between China and Brazil and is designed to allow Beijing time to take stock of the problem, begins immediately, the ministry said in a statement. China will decide when to begin importing again, it added. The suspension is a major blow for Brazilian farmers: China and Hong Kong buy more than half of Brazil's beef exports. The cases were identified in meat plants in the states of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais, the ministry said. It said they were the fourth and fifth cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease that have been detected in Brazil in 23 years. It said ""atypical"" mad cow disease develops spontaneously and is not related to eating contaminated foods. Brazil has never had a case of ""classic"" mad cow disease, it said. The two cases were confirmed on Friday after samples were sent to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lab in Alberta, Canada, the ministry said. The OIE had subsequently been informed of the two cases, in compliance with international norms, the ministry said. The ministry said there was no risk to animal or human health. Brazil's government will hope the suspension is lifted quickly. The country's powerful agribusiness sector is one of the main drivers of its long-lagging economy.

Thai PM survives no confidence vote as more anti-government protests planned,1824,"BANGKOK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and five cabinet ministers comfortably survived a vote of no confidence in parliament on Saturday as activists planned more protests against the government. Prayuth received 264 votes in favour and 208 against. Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and four other cabinet ministers also survived the censure motion in similar fashion. The opposition needed 242 of the 482 parliamentary votes to oust the prime minister. Prayuth said he remained confident after the vote. Lawmakers over four days accused his government of mishandling the pandemic and criticised him for the severe economic impact, taking aim at the government’s slow vaccine rollout as a result of not making advance vaccine orders and deciding not to join the international COVAX vaccine-supply scheme. Prayuth has stood by those decisions. This is the third censure motion the government has survived and comes as pro-democracy protesters plan more demonstrations on Saturday. Recent rallies have turned violent, with security forces using tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets against protesters who threw stones and firecrackers. Thailand has reported over 1.2 million infections and over 12,000 coronavirus-related deaths, most of them since April due to the Delta variant. Authorities reported the largest single-day increase in cases in mid-August with over 23,000 cases. The vaccine rollout began in June amid the country's most severe outbreak, with people unable to find medical treatment and some dying at home. About 13% of Thailand's more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated. The government cut its 2021 economic growth forecast for a third time, to 0.7%-1.2% from 1.5%-2.5%.

""It's just so good to be among so many people again. Let's hope it can set the example for other events to be allowed as well."" The grand prix, the first in the Netherlands in 36 years, is the country's first mass event since the pandemic arrived, with music festivals and other cultural events still limited to tiny audiences to limit the spread of the disease. This apparently uneven treatment has already sparked criticism in recent weeks, and images of thousands of people thronging the pathways at the race circuit fuelled the discontent on Friday, as many artists took to social media to express their anger. But health minister Hugo de Jonge said no exceptions were made for the grand prix, as the event followed the rules for hosting a large crowd, meaning all spectators needed a negative COVID-19 test to get in and had to remain in their assigned seats as much as possible. ""But there is friction between the rules and the reality on the ground"", De Jonge said, commenting on the masses of people who were clearly not in their seats. ""We can't avoid crowded situations. But we will manage the flow better and are asking people to remain in their seats longer"", Dutch GP spokesman Simon Keijzer said on Saturday. This did not prevent big crowds forming again, however, as soon as the Formula One drivers left the track and fans went looking for food, drinks and toilets. The rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has kept infections in the Netherlands relatively high in recent weeks, forcing the government to reinforce several social distancing measures last month. It also limited the grand prix to two-thirds of its original capacity of 105,000 tickets for visitors per day. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. seen funding humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, but not its government",3131,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is likely to finance U.N. and other agencies providing humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan but there is virtually no chance it will directly fund a new Taliban-led government, congressional aides said on Friday. The United States has been a massive funder of Afghanistan since its 2001 invasion to topple the Taliban, setting aside roughly $130 billion for security, governance and development and humanitarian needs. Aides to the Democrats who control both houses of Congress and to Republicans said lawmakers were nearly certain to provide humanitarian aid for internally displaced Afghans and refugees but not to the government itself, at least for now. ""It would be difficult to convince members of Congress to do anything that would appear to be supporting the Taliban government,"" said a senior Senate Democratic aide, citing the absence of oversight and a reluctance ""to support a government that is anathema to us."" A senior Senate Republican aide concurred. ""Republicans would absolutely not support giving money to the Taliban,"" the Republican aide said, saying they do not want to provide any money until Americans and Afghans who worked with the United States can leave Afghanistan. While aides said there was an understanding that agencies such as the World Food Program and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees would need funds, the Republican said lawmakers would want strict conditions on how it is spent. ""There needs to be a distinct look at what this is going to look like and how this is going to flow,"" he said. For fiscal 2022 starting Oct. 1, Congress set aside $136.45 million in the Economic Support Fund, which the Democratic aide said was the source for underwriting Afghan government salaries, and $52.03 million for Afghan humanitarian aid, according to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. The aides all but ruled out contributing to the salaries of Afghan civil servants who, working under a Taliban-led government, might oversee such basic services as running schools, health clinics and hospitals. ""I find it hard to imagine that happening, in part because how would we know that the funds weren't ending up in the wrong hands?"" said the senior Senate Democratic aide. The aide said Congress might appropriate as much as the $144 million to $279 million it has set aside annually in the last decade for Afghan humanitarian needs, depending on what U.N. agencies and others determine is required. The State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether it would request additional funds for Afghanistan. Taliban sources said the group's co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar would lead a new government set to be announced soon. Its first task may be to stave off the collapse of an economy grappling with drought and the ravages of a 20-year war. read more Taliban fighters entered Kabul on Aug. 15.

"Florida teachers on edge as mask war, COVID surge mark first weeks of school",2556,"HOMESTEAD, Fla., Sept 4 (Reuters) - American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten crouched to sit at a first-graders’ table in a Florida school, chatting with masked 6-year-olds about books and their former kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Smith. Lillian Smith, a local union steward who taught at William A. Chapman Elementary in Miami-Dade County for more than 30 years, died last month of COVID-19. At least four Miami-Dade County teachers or staff have died from COVID so far this school year, as cases and hospitalizations in Florida have soared. Weingarten, in Miami on Friday as part of a U.S. tour to support COVID-safe back-to-school measures like masking, told Reuters that Florida is ""a place where you have a governor who is more concerned about his political aspirations than the safety and the wellbeing of the people he was elected to serve."" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis in July issued an executive order barring school mask mandates. DeSantis, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said parents should decide if their children wear masks. Parents in Florida and across the country have clashed with school and health officials in what has become a politicized tussle over COVID precautions. Miami-Dade is among several districts that imposed mask requirements in defiance of DeSantis' order. This week, the state Department of Education withheld funding from two of those districts, though a state judge ruled last week that the state does not have the authority to ban mandates. read more Two small districts that did not require masks have had to shut down because of soaring COVID cases. With staff members sick or quarantined, bus driver and teacher shortages have led to overcrowding on buses and larger class sizes, making social distancing harder, Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar said. ""Districts are just trying to do the best they can, but it’s challenging when we’re not getting the support from the state,” Spar said. Valda McKinney, a local teachers' union organizer at Chapman, said the loss of her friend Lillian Smith -- who according to Weingarten and local news reports had not been vaccinated -- made COVID-19 feel more threatening. ""Teachers are anxious,"" McKinney said. In the first-grade classroom on Friday, national union leader Weingarten handed out new books. “This is our honoring Mrs. Smith,” Weingarten said. “One of the things she wanted more than anything else was for all of you to succeed.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Japan PM Suga to back vaccine minister Kono to succeed him,2516,"TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Japan's outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will back the popular minister in charge of the nation's vaccination rollout, Taro Kono, to succeed him, Nippon News Network reported on Saturday. Political manoeuvring was heating up among potential candidates and ruling party grandees on Saturday, a day after Suga's surprise announcement that he was stepping down, ending a one-year term as prime minister that has seen his support crumble as COVID-19 surged. Hours after Suga's announcement, broadcaster TBS reported, without citing sources, that Kono intended to run for head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Kono told reporters only that he wanted to consult party colleagues before deciding. Suga is expected to stay on until his successor is chosen in the party election scheduled for Sept. 29. The LDP leader will become prime minister given the party's majority in parliament. A former foreign and defence minister, Kono, 58, is popular among young voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers - a rarity in Japanese politics, which is dominated by older men less adept with social media. Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida has already thrown his hat in the ring, while several others have voiced interest. With no clear front-runner, the stance of Suga's predecessor Shinzo Abe will be closely watched, given his influence inside the two largest factions of the LDP and among conservative MPs, analysts say. Abe, who stepped down citing ill health last September after a record eight-year term, had publicly backed Suga's reelection. With Suga out, Abe now supports former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, who is close to the former premier, TBS said. Takaichi, who would be Japan's first female prime minister, had been seen as struggling to gain the backing of the 20 LDP lawmakers needed to run in the party race. Abe's support could boost her chances. Kishida said on Saturday he would leave the national sales tax at 10% if elected, reiterating that he would fund a new economic package worth tens of trillions of yen (hundreds of billions of dollars) by issuing more government bonds. ""I'm not thinking of touching the sales tax for the time being,"" Kishida told a Nippon News Network programme. ""We then must consider Japan's finances from the standpoint of how to make use of the fruit of economic growth."" Before Abe, Japan had six prime ministers in as many years.

"Australia reports record daily COVID-19 cases, braces for worse",2195,"MELBOURNE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Australia, struggling to quell its worst wave of COVID-19, reported 1,756 infections on Saturday, another record high, and officials warned that worse is yet to come, urging people to get vaccinated. Most of the cases were again in New South Wales, which has been fighting an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant since mid-June. The state reported 1,533 new cases and four further deaths. Neighbouring Victoria reported 190 cases, the Australian Capital Territory 32 and Queensland one. Recent daily infections are running about double the levels of Australia's previous worst wave of the pandemic a year ago. Believing this outbreak cannot be eliminated - a successful strategy used by states and territories in earlier waves - New South Wales and Victoria authorities have focussed on speeding inoculations to make the cases less virulent. Although infections in Victoria, in its sixth lockdown, dropped slightly from Friday's 208, health authorities said the outbreak has not peaked. ""The overall trend is a slow and steady increase. That's why vaccination is so critical, as is following the rules,"" Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told a press conference. New South Wales, the most populous state and home to Sydney, expects more than 1,000 new cases a day for at least two more weeks, with hospital admissions likely to peak in October. On Saturday, health officials said 137 of the 173 people in intensive care in hospitals were not vaccinated. Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, together home to nearly 60% of Australia's 25 million people, have been under strict lockdown for weeks. That is expected to continue until 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. At the current pace, Australia may reach that threshold in late October or early November. Only about a third of those aged 16 and over have been vaccinated, although the pace has picked up considerably, with the federal government racing to secure more Pfizer shots. Australia has recorded just under 60,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,036 deaths, far fewer than many comparable countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Fertility app maker Flo Health faces consolidated privacy lawsuit,3793,"(Reuters) - Flo Health Inc is facing a consolidated class action complaint accusing the period and fertility-tracking app developer of sharing users' sensitive health information with third parties without app users' knowledge. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in California federal court, also named the alleged third parties - Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, and data analytics companies Flurry Inc and AppsFlyer Inc - as defendants. Flo Health, through its counsel from Dechert, declined on Friday to comment on the pending litigation. Lawyers for Facebook, Google, Flurry and AppsFlyer, of the law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, Hunton Andrews Kurth and Latham & Watkins, respectively, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The newly filed action brings together plaintiffs from seven proposed class actions filed against Flo Health earlier this year. The first complaint stemming from the alleged unlawful data disclosure came after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Flo Health in January. Users of the women's health app hand over personal information to Flo Health, including ""intimate details"" about sexual health and menstrual cycles, among other things, to use the app, the complaint said. Flo Health allegedly violated users' privacy by disclosing that information to third parties through software development kits (SDKs) incorporated into its app, despite the company's privacy policies and ""public assurances"" that it would not share data, the complaint said. In using the third parties' SDKs, Flo Health transmitted the personal information back to other defendants, which allegedly ""knew that the data collected and received from Flo Health included intimate health data"" but didn't stop that because the data is ""vital to their business,"" such as for marketing and data analytics purposes, according to the complaint. The lawsuit asserts several claims against Flo Health, including invasion of privacy, breach of contract, and violation of the federal Stored Communications Act. The plaintiffs accuse the other companies of ""aiding and abetting"" Flo Health's alleged practices, among other claims, including a Federal Wiretap Act claim against Facebook, Google and Flurry. Plaintiffs' counsel filed a separate motion Thursday seeking the appointment of lawyers from three firms as interim co-lead counsel. The filing touts the data privacy, consumer protection and complex class action experience of the proposed leaders, and highlights the proposed structure as reflecting a ""diverse slate of attorneys."" Carol Villegas of Labaton Sucharow, Diana Zinser of Spector Roseman & Kodroff and Christian Levis of Lowey Dannenberg are seeking the leadership roles. The proposed leaders ""embody the diversity necessary to vindicate claims for women whose private intimate health data was disclosed without authorization,"" the lawyers wrote. Villegas, Zinser and Levis didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is Frasco v. Flo Health Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:21-cv-00757-JD.

U.S. COVID-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer - source,2810,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A White House plan to offer COVID-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE), a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout. ""It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know,"" Fauci said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject. Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month. As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that COVID infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."" Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said. U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier. The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers. FDA and CDC spokespeople referred questions to the White House. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court's rightward lurch put Roe v. Wade on the brink,4992,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump made a statement that seemed brash at the time: If he were elected and got the chance to nominate justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion would be overturned. By this time next year, with the court having tilted further to the right thanks to Trump's three appointments to the nation's highest court, his prediction could come true. The court's decision on Wednesday night to allow Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect in apparent contravention of the 1973 Roe decision suggests the court is closer than ever to overturning a ruling U.S. conservatives have long reviled. ""We don't know how quickly or openly the court will reverse Roe, but this decision suggests that it's only a matter of time,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion history at Florida State University College of Law. Two generations of American women have grown up with access to abortion, although its use has declined over the past decade. But while Roe handed liberals a victory on a crucial issue of the times, it also helped to power the religious right into a galvanizing force as it worked to get the decision overturned. Since Congress never acted to formalize abortion rights - which shows what a hot button issue it is politically - the same court that once legalized abortion has the power to allow states to ban it. In the coming months, the court will weigh whether to throw Roe out altogether as the justices consider whether to uphold a 15-week abortion ban in the state of Mississippi. Unlike the Texas dispute, in which the justices did not directly address whether Roe should be reversed, they will in the Mississippi case. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022, just months before an election that will determine whether the Democrats retain their narrow majority in both houses of Congress. The last time the Supreme Court was this close to overturning Roe, in 1992, opponents were bitterly disappointed when the court's moderates banded together and upheld abortion rights. Although the Supreme Court had a conservative majority, it was not deemed conservative enough. Storm clouds roll in over the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., September 1, 2021. REUTERS/Tom Brenner MCCONNELL'S ROLE The reason why the outcome could be different now is in part thanks to the decades-long efforts of conservative legal activists to re-shape the court, which bore fruit during Trump's presidency. Trump was aided by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as the death of liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which gave him a third vacancy to fill just before he lost the November 2020 election. All three Trump nominees were pre-vetted by conservative lawyers associated with the Federalist Society legal group. All three -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were in the majority as the court allowed the Texas abortion law to go into effect. The court now has a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority, which means that even if one peels away - as Chief Justice John Roberts did on Wednesday and in another abortion case in 2020 - the conservative bloc still retains the upper hand. Conservative Republican McConnell played a key role in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees to the bench. Democrats' hopes were raised early in 2016, when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died, that what had been a 5-4 conservative majority on the high court could switch to a 5-4 liberal majority for the first time in decades. McConnell crushed those dreams, refusing to move forward with then-Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. As a result, when Trump came into office in early 2017 he was able to immediately nominate Gorsuch, who was duly confirmed by McConnell's Republican-led Senate. Trump and McConnell then pushed through the nomination of Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 despite allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee, which he denied. Kennedy was a conservative but had voted to uphold abortion rights in key cases, including in 1992. Finally, in September 2020, Ginsburg died. In an unprecedented move, Trump and McConnell installed Barrett just days before Election Day on Nov. 7, leading to widespread accusations of hypocrisy but cementing the conservative majority. Despite the favorable winds, some anti-abortion advocates are playing down the importance of the Supreme Court's Texas ruling, and say the fate of Roe v Wade is still up in the air. ""I've long thought the court should overturn Roe because it is not based on what the Constitution actually says,"" said John Bursch, a lawyer at conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, before adding: ""This order doesn’t give a signal either way about what the majority will do in the Mississippi case.""

A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout. ""It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know,"" Fauci said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject. Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month. As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that COVID infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."" Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said. U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier. The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers.

Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court's rightward lurch put Roe v. Wade on the brink,4992,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump made a statement that seemed brash at the time: If he were elected and got the chance to nominate justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion would be overturned. By this time next year, with the court having tilted further to the right thanks to Trump's three appointments to the nation's highest court, his prediction could come true. The court's decision on Wednesday night to allow Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect in apparent contravention of the 1973 Roe decision suggests the court is closer than ever to overturning a ruling U.S. conservatives have long reviled. ""We don't know how quickly or openly the court will reverse Roe, but this decision suggests that it's only a matter of time,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion history at Florida State University College of Law. Two generations of American women have grown up with access to abortion, although its use has declined over the past decade. But while Roe handed liberals a victory on a crucial issue of the times, it also helped to power the religious right into a galvanizing force as it worked to get the decision overturned. Since Congress never acted to formalize abortion rights - which shows what a hot button issue it is politically - the same court that once legalized abortion has the power to allow states to ban it. In the coming months, the court will weigh whether to throw Roe out altogether as the justices consider whether to uphold a 15-week abortion ban in the state of Mississippi. Unlike the Texas dispute, in which the justices did not directly address whether Roe should be reversed, they will in the Mississippi case. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022, just months before an election that will determine whether the Democrats retain their narrow majority in both houses of Congress. The last time the Supreme Court was this close to overturning Roe, in 1992, opponents were bitterly disappointed when the court's moderates banded together and upheld abortion rights. Although the Supreme Court had a conservative majority, it was not deemed conservative enough. Storm clouds roll in over the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., September 1, 2021. REUTERS/Tom Brenner MCCONNELL'S ROLE The reason why the outcome could be different now is in part thanks to the decades-long efforts of conservative legal activists to re-shape the court, which bore fruit during Trump's presidency. Trump was aided by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as the death of liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which gave him a third vacancy to fill just before he lost the November 2020 election. All three Trump nominees were pre-vetted by conservative lawyers associated with the Federalist Society legal group. All three -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were in the majority as the court allowed the Texas abortion law to go into effect. The court now has a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority, which means that even if one peels away - as Chief Justice John Roberts did on Wednesday and in another abortion case in 2020 - the conservative bloc still retains the upper hand. Conservative Republican McConnell played a key role in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees to the bench. Democrats' hopes were raised early in 2016, when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died, that what had been a 5-4 conservative majority on the high court could switch to a 5-4 liberal majority for the first time in decades. McConnell crushed those dreams, refusing to move forward with then-Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. As a result, when Trump came into office in early 2017 he was able to immediately nominate Gorsuch, who was duly confirmed by McConnell's Republican-led Senate. Trump and McConnell then pushed through the nomination of Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 despite allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee, which he denied. Kennedy was a conservative but had voted to uphold abortion rights in key cases, including in 1992. Finally, in September 2020, Ginsburg died. In an unprecedented move, Trump and McConnell installed Barrett just days before Election Day on Nov. 7, leading to widespread accusations of hypocrisy but cementing the conservative majority. Despite the favorable winds, some anti-abortion advocates are playing down the importance of the Supreme Court's Texas ruling, and say the fate of Roe v Wade is still up in the air. ""I've long thought the court should overturn Roe because it is not based on what the Constitution actually says,"" said John Bursch, a lawyer at conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, before adding: ""This order doesn’t give a signal either way about what the majority will do in the Mississippi case.""

Latham requires vaccinations following FDA approval,3399,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Latham & Watkins, one of the highest-grossing and largest law firms in the U.S., will require all of its employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-October. Latham may be the first major U.S. law firm to implement a vaccination mandate following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's full approval of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine last month. About half of the 200 highest-grossing U.S. law firms are now requiring vaccinations, and in many firms, the percentage of employees who are vaccinated is between 90% to 95%, according to Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann. The first law firm to announce a vaccination mandate was Davis Wright Tremaine in January. Since then many more firms have issued mandates, particularly as U.S. coronavirus cases began spiking again due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Other law firms, including Baker McKenzie, Dechert, Dentons and Morrison & Foerster announced their vaccination mandates last week. But representatives at those firms confirmed those mandates were announced internally prior to the FDA approval. Latham's executive committee, in a memo sent to all U.S. employees on Wednesday, said more than 95% of its U.S. personnel and ""virtually 100%"" of its U.S. partners have been vaccinated. The memo was first published on the legal blog Above The Law on Friday; a representative for Latham confirmed the memo's authenticity and declined to comment further. The memo specifically cites FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine as one of the reasons why the firm is mandating vaccinations. Industry consultants said they expect the FDA approval will push more law firms and companies into adopting vaccination mandates. FDA approval gives law firms more legal coverage to mandate vaccinations, said Marcie Borgal Shunk, president of law firm consultancy The Tilt Institute. She said some people questioned whether a COVID-19 vaccine could be mandated when the FDA hasn't given full approval. ""With this step, law firms will gain confidence in their legal footing,"" Borgal Shunk added. Employers in many other industries are requiring their workforce to be vaccinated as well. One national survey of nearly 1,000 employers said more than half of U.S. companies are planning to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the workplace by year end, with almost a quarter considering vaccination as a condition for employment. Google's parent Alphabet Inc, Walmart Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are among the growing list of employers requiring some or all staff to get the vaccine.

"Porsche, Puma to join Germany's DAX as index expands",2285,"FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - German carmaker Porsche (PSHG_p.DE) and sportswear maker Puma (PUMG.DE) will join the nation's premier DAX stock index, as it expands to 40 from 30 companies in the biggest overhaul of its 33-year history, the exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) said on Friday. The expansion, contemplated for years, got a push in reaction to the collapse of German payments company Wirecard, which dramatically fell from grace in 2020, just two years after promotion to the benchmark index. A bigger index means greater diversification and potentially more stability for investors. The move promotes an array of companies to an index previously reserved for German corporate titans like Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Siemens (SIEM.NS). Other new entrants include the plane manufacturer Airbus (AIR.PA) and the online fashion retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE). The changes are effective on Monday, Sept. 20. Wirecard's demise embarrassed the German government and stained the nation's reputation as a safe haven investment, accelerating the reform imitative backed by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer. Deutsche Boerse announced the overhaul plans last November, saying the changes would improve quality of the DAX indexes and align them with international standards. . Over the past year, Deutsche Boerse has also imposed more stringent membership criteria in financial reporting and profitability. Manfred Schlumberger, portfolio manager at Starcapital, said he doubted the expansion would make the index more attractive. U.S. indexes are more attractive than their European counterparts because they have a high portion of future-oriented industries like technology and communication, he said. ""The DAX doesn't get that through the overhaul because those industries simply don't exist here,"" he said The remaining new entrants include: health technology company Siemens Healthineers (SHLG.DE), flavour and fragrance maker Symrise (SY1G.DE), lab equipment maker Sartorius (SATG.DE), chemicals distributor Brenntag (BNRGn.DE), meal-kit company Hellofresh (HFGG.DE), and genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE).

U.S. COVID-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer - source,2630,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House plan to offer COVID-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. A panel of experts that advises the FDA on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. It is not clear whether the Food and Drug Administration will have enough time to review Moderna's submission before the meeting.

Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month.

Brazil's Bolsonaro signs law that could break COVID-19 vaccine patents,811,"BRASILIA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday signed off on a law allowing for vaccine and medication patents to be broken in a public emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. But the right-wing leader vetoed the provisions that patent holders would need to transfer the knowledge and supply the raw materials needed to duplicate the vaccines and medications. According to a statement from his office, those provisions were seen as being too difficult to implement and discouraging investment in researching new technologies. Bolsonaro had previously criticized the law as potentially harming Brazil's commercial relationships. Under the law, the president is the one who would determine when to break a patent in an emergency. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"As COVID surges, more Florida school districts revolt against governor's mask rules",5235,"TAVARES, Fla., Sept 3 (Reuters) - In a scene replayed across the United States, angry parents and activists streamed into a meeting of the Florida's Lake County school board on Thursday where it considered whether to mandate mask-wearing for students and staff due to COVID. Some opponents of the mask proposal brandished signs that read “Let Our Children Breathe.” Even with Florida seeing a record number of coronavirus cases, one attendee called the pandemic ""overblown."" Another was escorted out by deputies after yelling at board members. The proposal would require staff and students to wear masks for 14 days at schools with COVID positivity rates at or above 5%. But Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, effectively banned similar mandates in July. Since DeSantis' order, more than a dozen Florida counties have rebelled and voted to require masks to protect students and teachers as the Delta variant sweeps across the state. This week, the state's Department of Education sanctioned two counties that passed school mask requirements. The battle between DeSantis and the state's school systems echoes larger fights across the country. Other Republican-run states such as Arizona and Texas have also banned mask mandates in schools even as COVID cases have soared in their states, as parents and voters are sharply divided over safety measures and personal freedoms. The pushback in Florida against the Republican governor initially was led by large urban school districts run by Democrats. But this week saw more conservative counties that backed Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election also defying DeSantis and instituting their own mandates. Earlier this week, populous Brevard County along Florida’s east coast, which went for Trump over President Joe Biden by more than 16 percentage points in November, narrowly voted to approve a 30-day school mask mandate. A day later, Hernando County, which supported Trump over Biden by almost 30 points, also passed a mandate, but one that allows parents to opt out. In Lake County near Orlando, which also strongly backed Trump, a school official said on Thursday that more than 1,000 students of the 36,000 in the district had tested positive for the virus. The board listened to more than three hours of public comment on the mask proposal then postponed a decision. Some 280 people spoke or sent emails on the issue, and two-thirds of them supported the idea, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Still, proponents of a mask mandate were booed and heckled by the crowd in attendance. “This topic has completely polarized communities,” said Andrea Messina, president of the Florida School Boards Association. Residents demonstrate before the Lake County School Board started an emergency meeting to discuss mask mandates to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tavares, Florida, U.S., September 2, 2021. REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo 'ABSOLUTE CRISIS' While the conflict centers on whether state or local governments are best equipped to make decisions on health and safety, it also has become a political challenge for DeSantis, whose state has once again become a COVID-19 hotbed. After being widely praised last year when cases declined and the state’s economy seemed revived, DeSantis has faced renewed criticism for his opposition to masks and employer vaccine mandates. Florida on Aug. 26 saw a single-day record number of new cases of the virus – almost 28,000 – since the pandemic began. A spokesperson for DeSantis, Christina Pushaw, defended the ban on school mandates, saying the governor is ""protecting the rights of families and children from all levels of government overreach."" At the Brevard County meeting on Monday, Misty Belford, the chair of the school board who a month earlier had opposed a mask mandate, switched her vote and gave proponents a 3-2 majority. Belford changed her mind, she told Reuters, after watching the district’s caseload spike, including a 49% increase in student cases from one week to the next. One school was closed for two days after most of its students were quarantined. “We are at an absolute crisis point,"" Belford said. But board member Katye Campbell, who voted against the mandate, said she worries about negative effects on students from requiring masks, such as asthma flare-ups, suicidal ideation and panic attacks. “There is nothing easy about this decision because our community is so divided,” Campbell said. Belford said she was relying on a decision from a Florida court last week that declared the DeSantis rule illegal. DeSantis on Thursday appealed the ruling. Earlier this week, the Florida Board of Education said it would penalize two counties that voted for mask mandates without providing a parental opt-out, Alachua and Broward, by withholding funds from the districts for the board members’ salaries. Leanetta McNealy, chair of the Alachua County school board, said her board voted for the mask mandate last month based on scientific evidence that it would help mitigate the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. “I’d rather have a decrease in my compensation than have a death under my watch,” she said.

Psilocybin lawyer asks 9th Circ to weigh workaround to fed drug law,3389,"(Reuters) - A Seattle, Washington, clinic on Thursday urged the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to order the federal Drug Enforcement Authority to offer a way for terminally ill patients to try psilocybin, the active chemical in hallucinogenic mushrooms, to treat their anxiety and depression. Much of the argument, before Circuit Judges Mark Bennett, Sandra Ikuta and Ryan Nelson, focused on whether the DEA's conclusion that it could not waive any part of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which bans psilocybin except for limited research purposes, could even be appealed. The clinic, the Advanced Integrative Medical Science (AIMS) Institute, asked the agency for permission to use psilocybin under Washington and federal ""right to try"" laws, which allow terminally ill patients to try drugs that are still under investigation. Forty-one states have passed such laws. Psilocybin has been the subject of clinical trials to treat terminal patients' anxiety and depression, but remains a so-called Schedule I substance under the CSA, meaning doctors cannot prescribe it. According to AIMS' petition for review, the DEA responded that there was no way for it to grant a waiver for the use of a Schedule I drug under right-to-try laws. At the outset of Thursday's argument, Nelson pressed AIMS' attorney, Matt Zorn of Yetter Coleman, to explain what exactly the clinic was appealing. ""How can a response to a request for instructions ever be a final order?"" he asked. ""It's because of the specific response in this case, and that response was, there is no process,"" Zorn said. ""Because the agency said there is nothing for you to use, we have nowhere to go."" The state of Washington, represented by Deputy Solicitor General Peter Gonick, weighed in to support the clinic. Gonick said the case raised the ""federalism concern that, where possible, statutes should be construed to avoid federal interference with areas traditionally left to states, such as regulation of the medical profession here."" He said that Congress and state legislatures had passed right-to-try laws because they recognized that the federal drug approval process was ""just too long"" for some terminally ill patients. Thomas Pulham of the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing for the DEA, said the agency's determination that the CSA did not allow it to grant waivers under right-to-try laws was not subject to review. ""It was an informal response to a request for assistance from a member of a regulated community that did nothing more than provide the agency's view on existing law,"" he said. When Nelson asked how the clinic could get the issue before a court, Pulham responded that if it administered psilocybin, and the DEA brought an enforcement action, it could challenge that action as unlawful. The answer did not fully satisfy the judge. ""Usually we don't require a party to go and subject themselves to liability in order to appeal,"" he said. The court did not clearly indicate how or when it would rule. The case is AIMS v. USDEA, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-70544.

Impel NeuroPharma enters migraine market with FDA nod for nasal spray,1875,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Impel NeuroPharma Inc's (IMPL.O) nasal spray to treat migraine got approval from the U.S. health regulator on Friday, marking the company's entry into a crowded market of medicines for a disease that affects about 39 million Americans. The drug, Trudhesa, can be self-administered to the bloodstream by being sprayed in the upper part of the nasal canal and is formulated using dihydroergotamine (DHE), an agent that works on the serotonin receptors linked to migraine. Impel will price the treatment between $600 and $850 for a pack containing four doses and is aiming for more than $500 million in peak sales, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Adams told Reuters. The Seattle-based company, which went public in April, plans to commercially launch Trudhesa in early October. Its rivals include Biohaven Pharmaceutical's (BHVN.N) Nurtec ODT and AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) Ubrelvy, both of which are orally administered. The market also has another intranasal DHE product, Migranal, whose commercial success has been held back by its less effective method of administration in the lower nasal cavity. Cowen & Co analysts said the Trudhesa's differentiated nasal delivery method should help it find a solid role in the treatment paradigm. Around 1 billion people worldwide suffer from migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. ""We are taking this product to a population that wants DHE ... to be available in a consistent, predictable and trustworthy way,"" Impel's Adams said.

Canada sees urgent need to get more young people vaccinated,1660,"OTTAWA/CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New modeling shows an ""urgent need"" to get more young adults in Canada vaccinated as the country fights a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant, the public health agency said on Friday. At the current rate of vaccination, new COVID-19 cases could surge past the peak of Canada's third wave and could exceed hospital capacity within months, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said. The modeling showed a need to speed up the overall rate of vaccinations, particularly for the 18-39 age group, to reduce the impact of the Delta resurgence, PHAC said in a presentation. ""The bottom line is that millions of people across Canada remain unvaccinated and at high risk of COVID-19 infections and severe illness outcomes,"" said Canada's chief public health officer Theresa Tam. The western province of Alberta said it will hand out C$100 ($79.96) gift cards as an incentive to encourage unvaccinated Albertans to get jabs. It is the first province in Canada to offer cash to boost vaccination uptake. Alberta has the lowest vaccination rate in Canada and leading the country in new COVID-19 cases, recording 1,339 new cases on Thursday. ""This is a crisis of the unvaccinated,"" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told a news conference on Friday. ""You are putting yourselves and our healthcare system at risk.""

"Early Canada election call backfires on Trudeau, who now trails in polls",3283,"MONTREAL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finds himself behind in polls ahead of a snap election he called hoping his management of the COVID-19 crisis would propel him to victory. Trudeau called the Sept. 20 election last month, two years ahead of schedule. At the time, his Liberals were well ahead and looked likely to regain the majority in parliament they lost in 2019. His main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, has repeatedly attacked him for calling a vote during the pandemic. The latest polls by Nanos, Ekos and others show Liberal fortunes have faded as voters have grown fatigued with Trudeau, 49, who has been in power since 2015. One Liberal strategist said on Friday the early-vote call had backfired as it was seen as ""wrong"" and ""greedy"" by electors. Also on Friday, Canadian health officials released modeling showing new COVID-19 cases could surpass the peak of the third wave within the month, and warned that if vaccinations among young adults do not ramp up, the country's hospital capacity may be exceeded. read more The Nanos Research survey for CTV put the Conservatives on 35.7% public support, with the Liberals on 30.7% and the smaller left-leaning New Democrats on 18.3%. An Ekos poll published late Thursday puts the Conservatives at 35.5% versus 30.7% for the Liberals.(See more polls: ) If these numbers hold up on election day, O'Toole would most likely win a minority administration. (See profiles of party leaders: read more ) On Thursday, the Conservative leader came out of a French-language leaders' debate without suffering much damage. During the exchanges, Trudeau said that if there were to be another minority government, there would most likely be another election in 18 months. read more ""We should not be in a campaign. Only Mr. Trudeau wanted this campaign for his own personal interests,"" O'Toole told reporters on Friday. ""And last night, he threatened another election if he doesn't get his way with this one. Canadians deserve better than that,"" he said after a campaign announcement in Montreal. On Friday, Trudeau said his debate comments referred to the average duration of minority governments. He then attacked O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates for domestic travel, saying the Conservative policy would put people in danger. ""Without strong leadership on vaccines, our kids won't be safe in the classroom, our businesses won't grow and thrive, and all Canadians will be at risk,"" Trudeau said. On Friday, Canadian health officials said there is an ""urgent need"" to ramp up vaccinations for 18- to 39-year-olds, who lag the rest of the population. They also said masking and social distancing must continue into the winter to prevent further spread. Some 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated. Liberal strategists expressed hope their fortunes will improve if Canadians start paying more attention next week after Monday's Labor Day holiday and two more debates. During the last two election campaigns, Trudeau won crucial support late by telling Canadians a vote for the New Democrats - who compete for the same left-leaning segment of the electorate - would split progressives resulting in a Conservative government.

Payrolls and the stock market: Wall Street usually shrugs off jobs report,2559,"NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Markets always look to the Labor Department's monthly employment report with great anticipation. But whether the data disappoints or surprises to the upside often has only a modest effect on overall stock index moves. Friday's report missed consensus by a mile, for example, showing the economy added a paltry 235,000 jobs instead of the 728,000 expected by economists. But Wall Street seemed to largely shrug off the disappointment. The S&P 500 was essentially flat. ""Today it’s as simple as ‘bad news is good news’ because the weak number gives the Fed cover to maintain its dovish outlook and likely push back tapering,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. Detrick also pointed to strengthening yields as a reason the stock market is not terribly worried. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose about 4 basis points to 1.3257% Friday afternoon on data in the jobs report showing wages heating up even more than feared. Even so benchmark Treasury yields are well below the highs earlier this year when traders were most worried about the U.S. recovery kindling durable inflation.

Biden warns of 'unconstitutional chaos' due to Texas abortion ban,6134,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause ""unconstitutional chaos"" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday. The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Texas' ban has so far survived legal challenges partly because of an unusual feature that leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, who could collect cash bounties of at least $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits against women who seek abortion after their sixth week of pregnancy or those who help them. Civil rights advocates warned that concept could cause havoc if it is adopted by other states or applied to other contentious rights, such as gun ownership. ""It unleashes unconstitutional chaos and empowers self-anointed enforcers to have devastating impacts,"" Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement directing federal agencies to act to protect the right to abortion enshrined in the high court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. ""Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health decisions faced by women."" By a 5-4 vote, the justices late on Wednesday denied an emergency request by abortion and women's health providers for an injunction on enforcement of the ban while litigation continues. The ban took effect early on Wednesday and prohibits abortion at a point when many women do not even realize they are pregnant. The law could still be blocked at some other stage. The law would amount to a near-total ban on the procedure in Texas - the second-most-populous U.S. state - as 85% to 90% of abortions are obtained after six weeks of pregnancy, and would probably force many clinics to close, abortion rights groups said. 'STUNNING' One of the court's six conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, joined its three liberals in dissent. ""The court's order is stunning,"" liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion. ""Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand."" In an unsigned explanation, the court's majority said the Texas law's unusual construction - leaving enforcement to individuals bringing lawsuits - limited its ability to act and that its decision was not a reflection of the ultimate constitutionality of the law. ""Federal courts enjoy the power to enjoin individuals tasked with enforcing laws, not the laws themselves,"" the court said. ""This order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts."" Pro-life supporter Josh Alcorn demonstrates in front of the Supreme Court after the Court upheld the first nationwide ban on a specific abortion procedure, in Washington, April 18, 2007. REUTERS/Jim Young (UNITED STATES) A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the United States, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In a June survey, some 52% said it should be legal in most or all cases, with just 36% saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The Republican president of Florida's state Senate, Wilton Simpson, told local station WFLY-TV on Thursday that he planned to follow Texas' lead and bring up a similar abortion ban in the chamber's next session. ""This law will begin saving the lives of tens of thousands of Texas babies and we look forward to the day that babies’ lives will be spared across America,"" said Carol Tobias, president of the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee. Biden, a Roman Catholic who has shifted to the left on abortion in recent years, said the White House would look at what steps the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can take to respond to the Texas law. The Office of the White House Counsel and Biden's Gender Policy Council will also review the matter. POLARIZING ISSUE Abortion remains a deeply polarizing issue, with a majority of Democrats supporting abortion rights and most Republicans opposing them. The number of abortions reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped in recent decades, to roughly 620,000 in 2018, the most recent figures, down from 790,000 in 2009. Congress has the power to legalize abortion nationwide, and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the Texas law and vowed to take up a bill to do so when Congress returns later this month. ""Its purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade, and even refuses to make exceptions for cases of rape and incest,"" Pelosi said. ""This ban necessitates codifying Roe v. Wade."" Democrats hold narrow majorities in Congress, but passage in the House would not guarantee success in the Senate, which requires 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. Democrats hold 50 seats in that chamber, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote. The court decision illustrates the impact of Republican former President Donald Trump's three conservative appointees to the nation's highest court, who have tilted it further to the right. All were in the majority. A ban like Texas' has never been permitted in any state since the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Texas is among a dozen mostly Republican-led states to ban the procedure once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, often at six weeks. Courts had previously blocked such bans, citing Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the coming months in a case centering on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, in which the state has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK panel does not recommend COVID vaccines for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds,2799,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain's vaccine advisers said they were not recommending the vaccination of all 12- to 15-year-olds against COVID-19, preferring a precautionary approach in healthy children due to a rare side effect of heart inflammation. The advice could see Britain pursue a different approach to the United States, Israel and some European countries, which have rolled out vaccinations to children more broadly. However a final decision has not been taken, as the British government said it would consult medical advisers to look at other factors, such as disruption to schools. Many politicians and some scientists have spoken out in favour of vaccinating more children amid concern that COVID-19 could spread in schools that are re-opening after summer holidays, further disrupting education. Britain has reported more than 133,000 deaths from COVID-19 and nearly 7 million cases, and while transmission among children can be high, they are rarely severely ill from the disease. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday said children with underlying conditions that made them more at risk from COVID-19 should get vaccinated. For healthy children, there was still a small benefit from receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and advisers said the risk-benefit was ""finely balanced"". However, the JCVI said it wanted more information on the long-term effects of rare reports of heart inflammation, known as myocarditis, in young people following vaccination with Pfizer's shot. Myocarditis is rare and normally mild, with patients usually recovering in a few days. read more ""Of course these vaccines do work and would be beneficial to children in terms of preventing infection and disease, but the number of serious cases that we see of COVID in children this age are really very small,"" JCVI member Adam Finn told Reuters. ""There are uncertainties about the long-term implications of (myocarditis), and that makes the risk-benefit balance for these children really quite tight and much tighter than we would be comfortable to make the recommendation."" UK health minister Sajid Javid, who sets policy for England, and his counterparts from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, wrote to the chief medical officers (CMOs) of the four nations, asking for further advice, ""including on educational impacts"". ""Given the importance of this issue, we would be grateful if you could provide your advice as soon as possible,"" the four health ministers said in a letter to the CMOs. The JCVI is also expected to advise on a potential booster vaccine programme for the elderly and vulnerable which could start this month. read more JCVI member Finn said there would be an update on boosters ""within the next few days.""

India restores mobile services in Kashmir two days after death of separatist leader,2057,"SRINAGAR, India, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mobile services in Indian Kashmir were restored late on Friday, two days after they were suspended following the death of a veteran secessionist leader in the disputed Himalayan region, a police official told Reuters. However, curbs on mobile internet and restrictions on the movement of people in the Kashmir valley would continue, police chief Vijay Kumar said. India tightened curbs on movement of people in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar and elsewhere, with scores of armed soldiers fanning out ahead of prayers on Friday, a day after Syed Ali Shah Geelani was laid to rest. Geelani, 91, died on Wednesday and was buried near his home in the city, where soldiers patrolled the streets to forestall any large-scale protests and gatherings at mosques. ""More troops have been deployed in sensitive areas and more roads have been barricaded,"" a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Despite the curfew there was violence in at least a dozen of places in Kashmir in which one paramilitary trooper was injured, the official said, adding that police had to use tear gas to disperse crowds. For years, Geelani, one of Kashmir's most senior political leaders, had led a hardline faction of separatist groups that sought to secede from India following an armed revolt against New Delhi. Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and arch rival Pakistan, which claim the region in full but rule only parts. Tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours was renewed in August 2019, when New Delhi scrapped the autonomy of its state of Jammu and Kashmir, splitting it into two federally administered territories. Shops were shut across parts of Srinagar, with many streets deserted and coils of barbed wire strung across them. Soldiers with assault rifles manned checkpoints. Health worker Shakeel Ahmad said he had to navigate more barricades on Friday to get to his hospital than a day ago. ""I was stopped at around a dozen places,"" he said.

Top U.S. health officials say not enough data to recommend boosters widely -New York Times,1021,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Top U.S. health officials have told the White House they may not have enough data to recommend COVID-19 booster shots for the wider general public by late September as President Joe Biden had anticipated, the New York Times reported on Friday. The top government officials advised the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the discussion. They said they needed more time to collect and review all the necessary data, according to the report. Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Times said.

Spain's 14-day COVID-19 contagion rate falls below 200 for first time in two months,676,"MADRID, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Spain's two-week COVID-19 contagion rate fell below 200 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for the first time in over two months, according to health ministry data on Friday. The 14-day contagion rate was 198, the first time it has dipped below 200 cases since July 2, the health ministry said. The health ministry said 71.5% of the population are fully vaccinated, while 39.4% of people aged 12 to 19 have received both doses of a vaccine.

"Japan's struggling PM Suga steps down, sets stage for new leader",5691,"TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in a surprise move on Friday he would step down, setting the stage for a new premier after a one-year tenure marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response and sinking public support. Suga, who took over after Shinzo Abe resigned last September citing ill health, has seen his approval ratings drop below 30% as the nation struggles with its worst wave of COVID-19 infections ahead of a general election this year. Suga did not capitalise on his last major achievement - hosting the Olympics, which were postponed months before he took office as coronavirus cases surged. His decision not to seek reelection as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president this month means the party will choose a new leader, who will become prime minister. There is no clear frontrunner, but the popular minister in charge of Japan's vaccination rollout, Taro Kono, intends to run, broadcaster TBS said on Friday without citing sources. Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida has already thrown his hat in the ring. Before Abe's record eight-year tenure, Japan had gone through six prime ministers in as many years, including Abe's own troubled first one-year term. Tokyo stocks jumped on news of Suga's decision, with the benchmark Nikkei (.N225) rising 2% and the broader Topix (.TOPX) hitting its highest levels since 1991. ""I want to focus on coronavirus response, so I told the LDP executive meeting that I've decided not to run in the party leadership race,"" Suga told reporters. ""I judged that I cannot juggle both and I should concentrate on either of them."" He said he would hold a news conference as early as next week. Suga's abrupt resignation ended a rollercoaster week in which he pulled out all the stops to save his job, including suggestions he would sack his long-term party ally, as well as plans to dissolve parliament and reshuffle party executive and his cabinet. He is expected to stay on until his successor is chosen in the party election slated for Sept. 29. The winner, assured of being premier due to the LDP's majority in the lower house of parliament, must call the general election by Nov. 28. Suga has been an important ally for U.S. President Joe Biden in pushing back against China's increasingly assertive behavior and he was the first foreign leader Biden welcomed in person at the White House in April. read more A State Department spokesperson said Biden was grateful for Suga’s leadership and partnership on shared challenges, including COVID-19, climate change, North Korea, China, and preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. ""The U.S.-Japan alliance is and will remain ironclad, not just between our governments, but our people,"" the spokesperson said. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to media after he annouced to pull out of a party leadership race at his official residence in Tokyo, Japan, September 3, 2021. Kyodo/via REUTERS Suga's departure will raise questions about the timing of an in-person summit of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Japan and Australia seen as a means to counter China that Washington has been looking to host this fall. read more RACE FOR LEADER Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said Kishida was the front runner for the moment, ""but that doesn't mean his victory is assured."" Nakano said Kono, Suga's administrative reform minister, could run if he gets the backing of his faction leader in the party, Finance Minister Taro Aso. Declaring himself a contender, Kishida, a soft-spoken Hiroshima lawmaker, on Thursday criticised Suga's coronavirus response and urged a stimulus package to combat the pandemic. Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba said he was ready to run if the conditions and environment are right. He was a rare LDP critic of Abe during his time as prime minister. Kono has led Japan's rocky inoculation drive, but remains high on the list of lawmakers voters want to see succeed Suga. Kono has stopped short of declaring his candidacy, telling reporters he wanted to carefully consult with party colleagues first. A former foreign and defence minister, Kono, 58, is popular with younger voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers - a rarity in Japanese politics dominated by older men who are less social media-savvy. Abe's stance will be closely watched given his influence inside the two largest factions of the LDP and among conservative MPs, experts say. The LDP-led coalition is not expected to lose its lower house majority, but forecasts suggest the LDP could lose the majority that it holds on its own, an outcome that would weaken whoever leads the party next. ""Stock prices are rising based on a view that the chance of LDP's defeat in the general election has diminished because anyone other than Suga will be able to regain popularity,"" said Toru Suehiro, a senior economist at Daiwa Securities. Suga's image as a shrewd political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy propelled his support to 74% when he took office. He initially won applause for populist promises such as lower mobile phone rates and insurance for fertility treatments. But removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and compromising with a junior coalition partner on policy for healthcare costs for the elderly drew criticism. His delay in halting a domestic travel programme - which experts say may have helped spread coronavirus around Japan - hit hard, while the public grew weary of states of emergency that hurt businesses.

"Tyson Foods, unions strike deal over COVID-19 vaccine mandate",2573,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. CHICAGO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) said on Friday that labor unions have agreed to support its requirement for U.S. employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by November, and the company will offer new benefits to workers including paid sick leave. Companies have been working to incentivize employees to get vaccinated through bonuses and other benefits as the highly contagious Delta variant drives an increase in U.S. coronavirus infections. In some instances, employees who do not get shots face penalties like higher insurance costs. read more Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said on Aug. 3 that U.S. employees must get vaccinated, though the requirement for unionized plant workers was subject to negotiations. read more The company has now won support from the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represent more than 80% of Tyson's 31,000 unionized workers in the United States, it said in a statement. Tyson runs slaughterhouses in rural areas where some residents have been reluctant to get vaccinated. In Iowa, where Tyson operates pork plants, 49% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to state data. Nationwide, 53% of the total population and 62% of people eligible for vaccines have been fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The UFCW, America's largest meatpacking union, said it secured 20 hours of paid sick leave per year for Tyson employees as part of negotiations over the mandate. It is the first national U.S. agreement to provide paid sick leave to meatpacking workers, the union said. All Tyson employees can begin earning the 20 hours starting on Jan. 1, the company said. The UFCW initially expressed concerns over the mandate because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not fully approved vaccines, instead granting approval for emergency use. Last week, the FDA granted full approval to Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE's shot. read more Tyson said more than 90,000 employees, or 75% of its U.S. workforce of 120,000, have received at least one dose of a vaccine, up from about 56,000 before the mandate. Some workers can be exempt from the mandate for religious or medical reasons, according to the UFCW."
"'They told us they hate Africans': Hundreds detained, deported from Abu Dhabi",5877,"BEIRUT, Sept 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kabirat Olokunde, a Nigerian migrant worker, planned to spend her birthday with friends in the city of Abu Dhabi. Instead, she turned 28 in a frigid prison cell, one of about 700 Africans imprisoned by Emirati authorities. In unparalleled mass arrests, the workers were jailed with ""no legal justification"" on the night of June 24-25, and later started being deported, said ImpACT International for Human Rights Policies and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor. ""I celebrated my birthday in chains, with no mattress,"" Olokunde said by phone from the Nigerian city of Lagos, where she was deported on Aug. 3 without access to her belongings. ""I still have the trauma in me,"" added the single mother, who is now jobless after working as a bus attendant and caretaker in Abu Dhabi, a regional trade and tourism hub that is part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In an Interior Ministry statement on Friday, the UAE said it had detained 376 men and women for offences related to human trafficking, ""extortion, assault, and acts contrary to public morality"". It said most of them were deported, but another 50 remained in prison due to a lack of travel documents. The Abu Dhabi government communications office and the Nigerian embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to requests for comment on the rights groups' report. Human rights groups have previously documented the imprisonment of hundreds of activists, academics and lawyers in the UAE, often following unfair trials on vague charges. The UAE has dismissed those accusations as false and unsubstantiated. RACIALLY MOTIVATED The UAE is home to nearly 10 million people, more than 80% of whom are expatriates who send remittances home to their families, according to the United Nations. Workers from developing countries often live in shared residencies in Abu Dhabi with separate wings for different nationalities, like La Gym, where Olokunde was arrested. African and Asian workers have highlighted stigmatisation and racism in the past, but the two rights groups said the June raid was a marked escalation. ""The scale of this racially motivated deportation is completely unprecedented,"" said Michela Pugliese, a migration researcher at Euro-Med Monitor. ""The victims and other migrants who aspire to work safely in the UAE have had this right unjustly revoked. Its consequences will be felt for years to come."" The investigation, based on interviews with more than 100 migrant workers, found that Abu Dhabi's Rapid Intervention Forces (SWAT), Criminal Investigation Department and police carried out mass arrests in at least four apartment buildings. The subsequent forced deportations were illegal, Pugliese said, as many of the workers had valid residency permits and work visas and were denied due process or access to their personal property. Friday's interior ministry statement said the deportations were conducted ""in accordance with legal procedures"" and with the knowledge of the workers' home countries. STUN GUNS Migrant workers told researchers that the arresting units used excessive force against them, including stun guns, and touched women's bodies inappropriately. Olokunde said she was arrested in shorts and a bra, and was not allowed to dress before being transported to the jail. When she and other women went on a hunger strike to demand justification for their arrest, they were chained for seven days, including her birthday, Olokunde said. Two workers who spoke to the Thomson Reuters Foundation said they slept on the floor in large, group cells, but were not given masks to protect against COVID-19 infection. In jail, the report said, detainees were denied access to health care and sanitary pads while women had their periods. The rights groups said detainees were not granted access to lawyers or told why they had been arrested - but some were indirectly accused of prostitution, which is a crime in the UAE. During her single, brief interrogation, Olokunde said she was asked, ""How much do you charge for a massage?"" SECRET CAMPAIGN According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), migrants are entitled to challenge their arrest in their country of residence. ""The abuses outlined demonstrate that migrants have had their rights to due process violated, and their detention conditions could amount to ill-treatment,"" said Rothna Begum, HRW's women's rights researcher in the Middle East. ""It is horrific that the UAE authorities appear to be conducting a secret campaign of mass arrests of African migrants, without any clear legal basis for such arrests or detention,"" she added. Kenneth Rubangakene, a 31-year-old Ugandan clerk who had lived in Abu Dhabi since 2017, also said he was taken from his La Gym apartment to prison. He said guards scanned his fingerprints and retinas without explanation, chained his hands and feet for three days, and imitated the sound of a couple having sex, asking if he had ever heard that noise at La Gym. ""They told us Africans are spoiling their country, they want to get rid of Africans from the street, we Africans are stupid,"" he said. He was deported from Dubai International Airport on July 29, according to a printed booking confirmation that Rubangakene shared with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which he said was given to him by prison guards. ""It was so shameful at the airport. You are arriving in a prison uniform, in prison sandals,"" he said. The Ugandan embassy in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rubangakene said he has about 6,000 dirham ($1,634) stuck in a bank account in the UAE that he cannot access, as his bankcard - along with teaching certifications he would need to apply for new jobs - all remained in his room. ""I came back with nothing. I'm starting from zero,"" he said. ($1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
